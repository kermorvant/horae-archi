    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, veiled and wearing a dark robe, riding a donkey. She cradles the Christ Child, who is swaddled and radiates a halo of light. Behind them, a bearded man, likely Saint Joseph, walks with his hand on his chest, suggesting weariness or devotion. The figures are set against a backdrop of rolling hills and a fortified town with towers and walls. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with foliate motifs.",
