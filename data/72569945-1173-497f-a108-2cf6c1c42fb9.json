    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man, likely Saint Mark, is seated outdoors under a tree, dressed in a blue tunic and a red and yellow cloak. He is holding an open book and a quill, appearing to write or study. Beside him, a griffin stands attentively. The background depicts a serene landscape with a body of water, a small house on an island, distant mountains, and a city skyline. A golden beam descends from the sky, suggesting divine inspiration. The scene is framed by an ornate golden architectural element on the left.",
