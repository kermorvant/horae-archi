    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely Saint John the Baptist, is depicted seated outdoors in a landscape. He has long, flowing hair and wears a simple tunic. He holds an open book in his lap and gestures with his right hand, possibly in discourse or contemplation. Beside him, a lamb rests, its head turned towards the figure. The background is a muted, undulating landscape with a suggestion of hills or fields under a pale sky. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic style with white highlights, suggesting a sketch or underdrawing.",
