    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint, stands in a verdant, grassy field. She has long, blonde hair and wears a green tunic beneath a flowing red mantle. In her left hand, she holds a cylindrical golden vessel, possibly a reliquary or a censer. Her right hand is raised, palm outward, in a gesture of blessing or offering. The background is a rich, patterned tapestry of red and gold, featuring geometric designs and inscribed Latin text, suggesting a devotional context. A radiant halo surrounds her head, indicating her sanctity. The overall impression is one of serene piety and spiritual significance.",
