    "scene_description_enriched": "A single figure, likely female, stands in profile, facing right. She wears a headdress and a long, draped robe. Her hands are raised, and she holds a long, slender object, possibly a sword or a scythe, pointing upwards. The background is filled with a dense pattern of small dots, suggesting a stylized sky or a celestial realm. The figure stands on a checkered floor, indicative of an architectural setting. The overall impression is one of solemnity and perhaps martyrdom or judgment.",
