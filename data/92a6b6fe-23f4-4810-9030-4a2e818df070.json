    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts two figures flanking a central text block. On the left, a bearded man wearing a cap and robes points towards the text. On the right, another figure, also robed and with a halo, raises their hands in prayer or supplication towards the text. Both figures are framed by architectural elements resembling pointed arches with decorative tracery. The text itself is in Latin, suggesting a religious or scholarly context. The scene appears to be an illustration accompanying a religious text, possibly from a Book of Hours or a similar devotional work, where figures are shown in contemplation or receiving divine inspiration.",
