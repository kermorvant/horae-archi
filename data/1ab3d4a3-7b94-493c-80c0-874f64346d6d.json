    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men, some wearing hats, gathered together. One man on the left holds a small, round object, possibly a purse or pouch. Another man in the center gestures with his hands. The figures are rendered in a stylized, woodcut manner. Above them, an arched architectural element frames the scene, with a dotted pattern filling the space within the arch.",
