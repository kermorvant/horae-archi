    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely Christ, seated on a throne or celestial body, holding a hammer and a chalice. He is surrounded by a starry background, suggesting a divine or cosmic setting. To his right, a figure with hands clasped in prayer appears to be an angel or a supplicant. Below, a group of figures, some crowned, look upwards towards the central figure. To the left of the central figure, a bird and a bull are depicted, possibly representing symbols of evangelists or divine attributes. Several lamps or candles are arranged in a semi-circle around the central figure, possibly symbolizing the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit or the seven churches of Revelation.",
