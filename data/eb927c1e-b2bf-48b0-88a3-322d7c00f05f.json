    "scene_description_enriched": "A lone figure, dressed in a simple tunic and cap, is depicted in a field of green grass, actively engaged in harvesting with a scythe. The figure's posture suggests exertion as they swing the tool. The background is a deep blue, speckled with gold, possibly representing a stylized sky or a celestial realm. This scene likely symbolizes the labor of harvest, which can be interpreted in a devotional context as representing the passage of time, the cycle of life and death, or the reaping of souls.",
