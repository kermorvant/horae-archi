    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a landscape under a blue, cloud-filled sky. On the left, two monks in grey habits are engaged in conversation, one holding a book. To their right, two other figures, one in a yellow robe and another in a pink robe, are also interacting. In the foreground, a stylized representation of flames erupts from the ground. To the far right, a dark, demonic figure with clawed feet and a white loincloth is visible. The overall impression is one of a spiritual or moral struggle, possibly involving temptation or judgment.",
