    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in a red cap and a light brown tunic, carrying a pole over his shoulder, walking with his eyes closed and head tilted back, suggesting he is asleep or exhausted. He is in an outdoor setting with barrels and a wooden fence to his left, and a building entrance with a dog emerging to his right. Above the scene, within a decorative golden frame, is a circular medallion containing a depiction of the zodiac sign Libra, represented by a balance scale. The overall composition suggests a narrative or allegorical representation, possibly related to the zodiac or a moralizing tale.",
