    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pietà, with the body of Christ, wounded and draped in a white loincloth, being held by a figure wearing a bishop's mitre and ornate robes. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers above Christ's head. In the background, architectural elements suggest a church interior, with figures in monastic habits and other observers present. The composition emphasizes the sorrow and sacrifice of Christ's passion.",
