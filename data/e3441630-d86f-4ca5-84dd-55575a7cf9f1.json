    "scene_description_enriched": "An elderly man with a halo, dressed in a dark monastic robe over a purple tunic, is depicted in prayer with his hands clasped. Before him lies an open book. To his left, a small, bristly pig looks up at him. The scene is set outdoors in a landscape with rolling green hills and a backdrop of stylized trees under a pale blue sky. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and devotion.",
