He appears to be looking towards a figure seated in a cloud-like formation in the upper right. This figure, with a halo, is writing on a scroll, with a bird perched nearby. In the background, a fortified building with a tower and a smaller adjacent structure is visible, along with a distant cityscape. The overall setting is a landscape with rolling hills and greenery.",
