    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic and fiery depiction of Hell, filled with tormented souls and demonic figures. In the center, a large, crowned demon, possibly Satan, reclines on a structure resembling a pyre or a bed, surrounded by numerous naked souls. Other demons, with bat-like wings and grotesque features, torment the souls, dragging them into fires or impaling them. Some souls are shown falling from above into the inferno, while others are trapped in fiery pits. The setting is rocky and barren, with flames erupting from the ground and rocks. The overall impression is one of extreme suffering and eternal damnation.",
