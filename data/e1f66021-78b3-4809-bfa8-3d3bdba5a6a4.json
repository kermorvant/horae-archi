    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer, dressed in a blue robe, and holding a book. Archangel Gabriel, with golden wings and a richly patterned robe, descends from above, holding a scroll with text. He is accompanied by rays of divine light emanating from a figure in the upper left, likely God the Father. The setting appears to be a room with architectural elements suggesting an interior, including a bed with green cushions and a red canopy or curtained structure. The background shows a series of arches, indicative of a religious or grand architectural space.",
