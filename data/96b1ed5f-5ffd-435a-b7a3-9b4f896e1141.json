    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act within an interior space. A seated figure, likely a ruler, in a blue robe and a distinctive white and green hat, gestures with his left hand. Before him, a man in an orange tunic and armor wields a sword, seemingly in the act of beheading a figure dressed in blue. Another figure in blue and red is shown kneeling, with a severed head and blood visible. To the right, a woman in a red robe and a blue and yellow hat holds a child, who is looking towards the central action. The background features a red tapestry with gold patterns and a gold patterned wall above. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern.",
