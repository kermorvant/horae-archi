    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a multitude of figures, predominantly men with beards and wearing varied hats and tunics in shades of red, blue, green, and gold. They are arranged in clusters, seemingly emerging from stylized green foliage that forms a branching structure against a bright blue background. Some figures hold staffs or scrolls, and many are gesturing with their hands, pointing or interacting with each other. One figure, possibly female, is depicted with a blue veil and hands clasped in prayer. The overall impression is one of a gathering or assembly, possibly representing a lineage or a group of prophets or saints.",
