    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an arched architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with blue wings and a golden halo, kneels and presents a scroll inscribed with \"Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum.\" He is dressed in a rose-colored robe. On the right, the Virgin Mary, also with a golden halo, kneels on a green cushion, her hands raised in a gesture of acceptance or surprise. She wears a blue robe and is reading from an open book. Above and behind the Virgin Mary, a representation of God the Father is visible in a celestial realm, with rays of light descending towards the scene. The architecture features blue vaulted ceilings with red ribbing, Gothic windows, and a red patterned wall or tapestry. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern. The overall scene is framed by an ornate, illuminated arch.",
