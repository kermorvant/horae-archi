    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, likely a saint, is depicted frontally against a bright blue sky and a muted landscape of grey hills and green ground. He wears a tonsured haircut and a golden halo. His attire consists of a white garment underneath a richly decorated red robe with gold patterns. His hands are clasped together, holding a cluster of dark, round objects, possibly stones or coals, which are characteristic attributes of Saint Lawrence. The overall presentation is devotional, focusing on the individual saint.",
