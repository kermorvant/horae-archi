    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling in prayer before a seated figure. The kneeling figure, clad in a blue robe with orange cuffs, has his hands clasped in supplication and his head tilted upwards. Behind him, a richly patterned orange and red textile hangs from a rod, suggesting an interior setting. The seated figure, identified by a halo, wears a pink robe over an orange tunic and holds a white orb in his left hand, while raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing or speech. The background is a deep blue with decorative patterns. This scene is likely a representation of David in Prayer, a common motif in Books of Hours, where David is often depicted in supplication before God.",
