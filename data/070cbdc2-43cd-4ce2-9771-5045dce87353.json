The Virgin Mary, depicted in the upper right, recoils slightly with hands clasped in prayer. A decorative vase stands between them. The lower register shows the Virgin Mary seated and reading a book, while Saint Joseph leans on a staff, looking towards her. The scene is set against a gold background, suggesting a divine or spiritual setting, with architectural elements like an arched structure visible in the lower left.",
