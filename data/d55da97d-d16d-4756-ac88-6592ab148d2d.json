    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man with a halo, likely a saint or evangelist, is seated and writing in a book. He is dressed in a robe and points with his right hand to an open book before him. To his left, a kneeling figure, possibly an angel or a disciple, holds a book with circular markings. The scene is framed by architectural elements, including columns and arched structures, suggesting an interior setting. A triangular object with a circular base, possibly a symbol or an architectural feature, is visible above the seated figure's right shoulder.",
