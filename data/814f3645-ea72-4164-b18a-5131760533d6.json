    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures within an arched frame decorated with floral motifs. On the left, a woman in a hooded mantle and long robe, identified as the Virgin Mary by her halo, holds a child. The child, also with a halo, is reaching towards the woman on the right. This second woman, also with a halo, is dressed in a long robe and appears to be kneeling or in a posture of reverence. Behind the figures, a stylized landscape unfolds with trees and a prominent, angular architectural structure resembling a city or castle with multiple spires. The overall composition suggests a religious narrative, likely the Visitation, where Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth.",
