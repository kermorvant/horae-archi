    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male figure, likely a saint, stands within an arched architectural setting. He wears a habit with a cross emblem on the chest and holds an open book in his left hand, while his right hand rests on a staff or crosier adorned with beads. To his left, a small animal, possibly a dog or a wolf, is depicted. To his right, a stylized architectural element resembling a tower or a building facade with a circular motif is visible. The background is filled with a dotted pattern, suggesting a decorative or symbolic element. The overall scene is rendered in a woodcut style, typical of medieval manuscripts.",
