    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ seated on a throne, holding an orb, and gesturing with his right hand. He is flanked by two angels, one above and to his left, and another to his right. To Christ's left, a crowned female figure stands, while a kneeling female figure in a blue gown and white headdress is positioned in front of her. Behind the figures, an architectural setting is visible, with arched windows and a cityscape in the background. The overall scene suggests a divine or royal audience, possibly representing Christ's authority or a moment of spiritual significance.",
