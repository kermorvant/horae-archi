    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, with a halo, holding the Christ Child. She is seated on a bed covered with a blue cloth. To the right, an elderly man, likely Saint Joseph, with a red hood and purple robe, sits in a wooden chair, leaning forward and holding a staff. The background suggests an interior space with a window and a draped canopy above the bed. The overall scene evokes a sense of domestic intimacy and religious devotion, likely representing the Nativity or a related moment of the Holy Family.",
