    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross, his body showing wounds and blood. To the left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle over a pink robe, her hands clasped in prayer. To the right, a figure in a brown robe with a red mantle, also with hands clasped in prayer, is likely Saint John the Evangelist. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills and a body of water is visible, along with stylized buildings suggesting a city. The overall scene is rendered with a flat perspective typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
