    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary breastfeeding the Christ Child, with Saint Joseph standing to her left. They are positioned within a simple architectural structure, possibly a stable, suggested by the wooden beams overhead. In the background, a walled town or city with buildings and a prominent tower is visible, set against a hilly landscape. The composition evokes a sense of domesticity and the humble beginnings of Christ's life.",
