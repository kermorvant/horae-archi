    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. The Virgin Mary, seated on an ornate chair, is reading a book. The Angel Gabriel, with red and blue wings, kneels before her, holding a branch and looking upwards. A beam of light, originating from a figure in the upper left, descends towards Mary. The architectural setting is elaborate, featuring a multi-tiered structure with arches, columns, and decorative tracery. The background includes a blue sky with golden stars and some trees. The overall scene is rendered with vibrant colors and intricate details, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
