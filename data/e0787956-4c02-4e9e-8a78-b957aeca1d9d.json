They appear to be reading or listening intently. To the right, a group of figures in dark, hooded robes, possibly monks or nuns, are also present, their faces visible. In the foreground, a draped table or altar covered in a blue cloth with gold patterns is depicted. The background features a decorative, tiled pattern above a reddish-brown surface, suggesting an interior setting.",
