    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned with a mitre and rich vestments, stands on the left, holding a crozier. He is facing a group of three nude children who are depicted with clasped hands, seemingly in prayer or supplication, within a circular wooden tub. Behind the bishop, a window opens to a landscape featuring a castle on a rocky outcrop under a blue sky. The interior space is suggested by a dark, patterned wall behind the bishop and the window frame.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a bishop performing a miracle or offering protection to children, possibly related to a saint known for interceding for children or a specific devotional practice involving children's welfare. The presence of the bishop in ceremonial attire and the children in a vulnerable state suggests a theme of spiritual guidance and divine intervention.",
