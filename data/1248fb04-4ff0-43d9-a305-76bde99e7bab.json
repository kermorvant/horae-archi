    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Trinity, with God the Father holding the crucified Christ. God the Father is shown as an elderly man with a beard, wearing a blue robe over a red tunic, and a golden halo with rays emanating from it. Christ is depicted as a nude figure, arms outstretched on a wooden cross, with a crown of thorns and a golden halo. He is positioned in front of God the Father, whose large blue robe envelops the lower part of the scene. The background is a rich gold pattern of squares, each containing a stylized cross-like motif in red. Below the figures, a fragment of architectural structure is visible, suggesting a platform or altar, with a checkered pattern at its base.",
