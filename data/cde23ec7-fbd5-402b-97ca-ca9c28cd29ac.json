    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession or battle involving an elephant, led by a figure in armor. Behind the elephant, a crowd of people with expressive faces appears to be reacting to the event, some with open mouths. In the background, architectural structures, including buildings with windows and what might be a tower, are visible. The overall impression is one of movement and possibly conflict or spectacle.",
    "scene_interpretation": "While the specific event is not definitively identifiable from the provided image, the presence of an elephant and a crowd suggests a historical or possibly allegorical scene. Elephants were sometimes used in warfare or as symbols of power and exoticism in medieval art. Without further context or clearer iconographic details, a precise religious or biblical interpretation is not possible.",
