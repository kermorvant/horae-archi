    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of four figures standing before a large, imposing Gothic cathedral. On the left, a woman in a blue robe and white veil stands with her hands clasped. Beside her, a man with a beard, also in a golden robe, looks upwards with his arms outstretched in supplication. Facing them on the right are two figures in golden robes, one an older man with a beard and halo, and the other a woman with a halo. The man has his hands clasped in prayer, while the woman's hands are raised in a gesture of blessing or greeting. The background features a stylized landscape with blue hills and trees, and a bright blue sky with golden clouds. The cathedral itself is rendered in shades of grey and white, with prominent spires and intricate architectural details, suggesting a significant religious structure.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of divine revelation or a significant religious encounter, possibly related to the Old Testament prophets or saints. The figures with halos suggest sanctity. The man with outstretched arms could be receiving a vision or a message, while the praying figures might be witnessing or participating in a sacred event. The presence of the cathedral emphasizes the religious context.",
