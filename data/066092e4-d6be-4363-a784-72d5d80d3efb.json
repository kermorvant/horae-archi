    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and the palm frond she holds, stands draped in a blue robe. Her head is tilted downwards, and her gaze is directed towards the palm. To her left, a miniature architectural structure, resembling a tower or shrine, is depicted. This structure has a rounded roof with a finial and a small arched doorway. The background is a rich red tapestry with a repeating gold and blue diamond pattern. The ground beneath the figures is rendered in green with sparse tufts of grass. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
