    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a young man, possibly a saint or prophet, seated on a grassy island surrounded by water. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a red cloak, with a halo around his head, indicating his sanctity. He is writing on a scroll, with a large bird, possibly an eagle, perched beside him and holding a quill in its beak, assisting him. In the background, a city with towers and spires is visible on rolling hills, with a body of water in the foreground. The entire scene is framed by an arched architectural element with decorative columns and foliage. This imagery is likely a representation of Saint John the Evangelist, traditionally associated with an eagle as his symbol and the writing of his Gospel.",
