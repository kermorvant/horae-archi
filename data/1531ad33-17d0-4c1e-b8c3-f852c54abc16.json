    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession of men, some on horseback, moving under a decorative arch. The figures are dressed in medieval attire, with various hats and tunics. One man in the foreground, possibly a soldier or attendant, is leading a horse and carrying a staff. Behind him, several other men are visible, some with beards and wearing hats. The background is filled with a patterned texture, suggesting an interior or a stylized representation of space. The overall impression is one of movement and perhaps a journey or a formal entry.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene does not clearly depict a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional event. It appears to be a general representation of a procession or a group of people, possibly related to a historical or narrative context rather than a religious one.",
