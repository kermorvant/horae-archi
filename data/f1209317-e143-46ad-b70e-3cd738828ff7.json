    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a field of tall, dry stalks, likely representing a harvest. On the left, a person wearing a purple tunic and a white headdress holds a small, wooden barrel. On the right, another person, dressed in a blue tunic and a wide-brimmed hat, is shown from the chest up, holding a sickle, suggesting they are engaged in harvesting. The background is a dense field of vertical lines in shades of brown and beige, interspersed with small orange and blue dots, evoking a harvest setting under a bright blue sky. The overall impression is one of agricultural labor.",
