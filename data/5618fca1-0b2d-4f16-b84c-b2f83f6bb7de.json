God the Father, depicted as an elderly man with a beard and halo, holds the crucified Christ. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers between them. Christ, shown as a young man, is on the cross, his body rendered with anatomical detail. God the Father is seated on a wooden structure, draped in robes. The background is a textured gold, suggesting a divine or otherworldly setting. The entire composition is framed by a large, ornate blue initial 'C'.",
