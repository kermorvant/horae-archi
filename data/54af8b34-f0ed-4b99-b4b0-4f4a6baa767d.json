    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a regal figure, likely a king or a saint, standing within an arched architectural setting. The figure wears a crown, a red cape lined with ermine, and ornate golden armor. They hold a sword in their right hand and a blue, book-like object in their left. A golden lion is positioned at the figure's feet, with the figure's left foot resting on its back. The background features a blue tapestry with gold motifs and glimpses of a green landscape through an opening. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern of green and blue. The overall impression is one of power, authority, and possibly divine favor, given the lion's symbolic association with royalty and strength.",
