    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of three men interacting with a haloed figure, presumably Christ, who stands on the right. One man kneels with clasped hands, looking up at Christ. Another man, standing behind the kneeling figure, places a hand on the kneeling man's shoulder and gestures towards Christ. A third man stands to the left, also looking towards Christ. Between the kneeling man and Christ, a jug and a round object, possibly bread, are placed on the ground. Behind the group of men is a stylized tree or cross. The figures are rendered in a simple, somewhat crude style, with minimal architectural detail. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
