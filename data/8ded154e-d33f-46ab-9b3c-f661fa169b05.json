    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a banquet taking place indoors, with figures seated at a table laden with food and illuminated by candles. Outside, through a series of arches, a bustling city street is visible, with people in carriages and on foot, suggesting a lively urban environment. In the foreground, a group of figures, including musicians playing instruments and attendants holding torches, are positioned between the indoor banquet and the outdoor scene. A cherubic figure stands near the musicians. The overall impression is one of festivity and social gathering, possibly a celebration or a royal event.",
