    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an elderly man with a long white beard, kneeling in prayer with his hands clasped. He is unclothed except for a light blue loincloth. Behind him is a large bed with white pillows and a red draped cover, partially obscured by blue curtains adorned with gold patterns. To the left, framed by an arch, is a window showing a scene of a man, possibly a craftsman, working with thread and fabric, with red figures and flames visible behind him. Below this window, within a circular niche, is a depiction of a seated figure in prayer. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern of pink, green, and white squares. The overall setting appears to be an interior space, possibly a bedroom, with architectural elements suggesting a domestic or monastic context.",
