    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a rural landscape with two figures engaged in agricultural labor. A man, wearing a straw hat and blue tunic, is actively mowing grass with a scythe. To his right, a woman, dressed in an orange gown and blue head covering, is seated on the ground, tending to a pot and what appears to be food. A wooden fence encloses the immediate area, and in the background, rolling hills and distant buildings suggest a cultivated countryside. The overall impression is one of seasonal work and sustenance.",
