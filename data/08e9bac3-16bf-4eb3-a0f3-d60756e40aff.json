    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within a bordered frame. On the left, three men with distinctive pointed hats stand behind a central figure wearing a halo and a dark robe, who is holding a staff. To the right of the haloed figure, a young boy in a tunic holds a bowl. Facing the boy, a man in a dark robe, also wearing a pointed hat, pours liquid from a vessel into the bowl. Behind this man, a small architectural structure with arched openings is visible. The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting an interior or a dimly lit outdoor setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a charitable act, possibly the feeding of the poor or a similar act of mercy, given the offering of food or drink. The haloed figure could be a saint or a significant religious figure, and the act of giving to the needy is a common theme in Christian devotion.",
