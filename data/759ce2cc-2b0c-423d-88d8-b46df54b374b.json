    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle adorned with gold patterns and a white veil, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child swaddled in brown cloth. Saint Joseph, an elderly man with a long white beard, walks beside the donkey, holding a staff. They are in an outdoor setting with a blue sky, rolling hills, and a stylized tree on the right. In the background, distant architectural structures, possibly representing a city or town, are visible on the horizon.",
