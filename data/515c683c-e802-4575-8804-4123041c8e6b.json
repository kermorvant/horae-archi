She wears a vibrant red cloak over a pale yellow gown. In her hands, she holds a small, cylindrical vessel, possibly a pot or a reliquary, with its lid open. The floor is tiled in a black and pink diamond pattern. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element with blue and red borders, suggesting an interior setting.",
