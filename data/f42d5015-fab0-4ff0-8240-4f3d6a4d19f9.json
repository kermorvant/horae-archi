    "scene_description_enriched": "Two young figures, likely angels or youths, are depicted in a stylized outdoor setting with a green, grassy ground and a blue sky. They are positioned on either side of a vertical wooden beam, which they are both grasping with their hands. Both figures wear simple, pale pink tunics with darker pink trim and a small cross emblem on the chest. Their hair is light brown and falls to their shoulders. The figure on the left looks towards the viewer's left, while the figure on the right looks towards the viewer's right. Above them, a brown architectural element, possibly a lintel or beam, is visible with decorative carvings. The scene is framed by a gold border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the Lamentation of Christ or a related moment of sorrow and reverence, possibly involving angels or holy youths mourning the crucifixion. The cross-like emblem on their tunics and their interaction with a wooden beam suggestive of the cross reinforce this interpretation. The golden border suggests a sacred or devotional context.",
