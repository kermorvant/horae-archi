    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel, wings outstretched and adorned in a golden robe, kneeling and addressing the Virgin Mary. He holds a staff and rays of divine light descend from him towards Mary. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle over a golden tunic, kneels with clasped hands, looking upwards with a halo indicating her sanctity. She is seated near a book on a desk. Behind her is a richly decorated bed with a red coverlet and a white pillow. The setting appears to be an interior space with architectural elements such as a balustrade and windows with tracery in the background. The overall scene is rendered with vibrant colors and intricate detail, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
