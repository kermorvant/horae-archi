    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Christ Child lies on a table covered with green fabric, illuminated by a golden, textured background. To the left, a brown ox and a grey donkey are visible. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Beside her, Saint Joseph, wearing a red cap and a reddish-brown robe, also kneels with his hands pressed together in devotion. An open book lies on the grassy ground in front of Mary. The architectural setting is a simple stable structure with a wooden roof and walls, suggesting a rustic and modest environment for the birth of Christ.",
