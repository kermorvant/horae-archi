    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting, framed by arches. On the left, a crowned figure, possibly a king, is shown in profile, gesturing with his hands. In the center, a group of men, some holding staffs or lances, are engaged in conversation. One man, seated and bearded, appears to be speaking to another standing figure. To the right, a woman with elaborate hair is depicted in profile, her hands raised in a gesture of prayer or supplication. The architectural elements suggest an interior space with decorative arches and patterned backgrounds.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a courtly or royal audience, possibly depicting a moment from a biblical narrative or a historical event. The presence of a crowned figure, advisors, and a supplicant woman suggests themes of justice, petition, or counsel. Without further context, a specific biblical event is difficult to pinpoint, but it could relate to a king receiving a plea or making a judgment.",
