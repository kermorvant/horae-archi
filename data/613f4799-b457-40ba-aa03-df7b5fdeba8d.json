    "scene_description_enriched": "In a verdant landscape dotted with trees, Christ, identified by his halo, gestures with his right hand towards a kneeling man in a richly patterned purple robe. Christ wears a blue tunic and a golden-brown mantle. The kneeling man, with his hands clasped, appears to be pleading or receiving a blessing. A crowd of onlookers, some wearing turbans and elaborate hats, observe the scene. In the background, a complex of buildings with spires and towers, suggestive of a city or a large religious complex, is depicted against a pale sky.",
