    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue and wearing a veil, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child who is dressed in red. To their right, an older man, presumably Saint Joseph, walks alongside, also dressed in robes and a red cloak. The background features a pastoral landscape with trees, a winding river, a windmill, and in the distance, a fortified castle or town on a hill. The overall impression is one of travel and perhaps seeking refuge.",
