    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a trial or judgment, with Jesus, identifiable by his halo, being presented to a seated figure who appears to be a judge or ruler. Jesus is robed in pink and is accompanied by a group of soldiers in armor. Two figures, one in red and green and the other in blue, gesture towards Jesus, possibly making accusations or pleas. A kneeling figure in green is also present. The setting is an interior space with a vaulted blue ceiling and a large, latticed window. A richly decorated canopy and carpet suggest a formal or royal setting. The overall impression is one of authority and judgment, with Jesus as the central figure under scrutiny.",
