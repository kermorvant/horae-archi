    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a confrontation between demonic figures and human figures, set against a backdrop of stylized floral and thorny vegetation. On the left, several dark, horned demons with clawed feet are present. One prominent demon, draped in a light-colored garment, appears to be addressing or interacting with a group of human figures on the right. These human figures consist of a woman in a richly patterned dark dress, accompanied by two hooded figures, possibly representing temptation or spiritual peril. The overall composition suggests a narrative of spiritual struggle or temptation, possibly illustrating a scene of sin or the influence of evil.",
