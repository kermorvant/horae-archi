    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman, likely Bathsheba, bathing in a large tub, holding an apple and a cross-shaped pendant. She is attended by several women. One woman holds a mirror reflecting Bathsheba, another appears to be combing her hair, and two others stand nearby, one holding a bowl of fruit or berries. Above and to the left, a man, possibly King David, is visible through an arched window, observing the scene. In the background, there is a stylized architectural setting with towers and mountainous terrain. The overall composition suggests a narrative scene from the Old Testament, specifically the story of David and Bathsheba.",
