    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a cloth bearing the face of Christ. On the left, a woman in a veil and mantle, with hands clasped in prayer, looks towards the center. Next to her, another figure, possibly a woman, also with hands clasped, gazes forward. Behind them, another figure stands. To the right, a man in a hat and robes, with a distinctive profile, holds the cloth with the face of Christ. Behind him, another figure is partially visible. In the background, to the right, a simplified representation of buildings with towers and roofs suggests an urban or ecclesiastical setting. The entire scene is framed by an arched element, possibly representing a canopy or architectural detail.",
