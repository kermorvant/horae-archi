    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, veiled and holding the Christ Child, riding a donkey. She is accompanied by a bearded man, likely Saint Joseph, who walks beside them. The figures are set against a green, hilly landscape with some vegetation. Above them, an ornate architectural frame with a patterned background suggests a decorative border or a stylized representation of a celestial realm. The Virgin Mary wears a blue mantle over a red tunic, and Saint Joseph wears a pink robe over a blue garment. The Christ Child is visible in Mary's arms, with a halo.",
