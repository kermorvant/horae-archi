    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a decorative border with foliate motifs and a central figure. The figure appears to be a person wearing a crown or elaborate headdress, with a patterned garment and hands clasped. The surrounding elements are stylized vegetal forms, possibly representing vines or leaves, rendered in black ink on a light background. There is no discernible architectural setting or specific action beyond the figure's posture.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is likely a decorative element from a manuscript, possibly a historiated initial or a border. The figure's regal attire suggests it could represent a king or a saintly figure of high status. Without further context or accompanying text, a specific religious or biblical interpretation is not possible. The foliate motifs are common decorative elements in medieval art.",
