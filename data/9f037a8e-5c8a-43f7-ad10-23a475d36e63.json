    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male figure, identified as Saint John the Baptist by his halo and attributes, stands in a verdant landscape. He is depicted reading an open blue book, with his left hand holding the pages and his right hand resting on the cover. He wears a red cloak over a green tunic and purple trousers. A staff, topped with a golden orb, is held in his right hand, and a grey wing is visible behind his shoulder, suggesting his angelic or prophetic nature. In the background, rolling green hills are dotted with trees, and a distant town with towers and spires is visible under a bright blue sky with golden rays emanating from the upper left. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
