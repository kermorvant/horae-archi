    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men gathered under an arched structure. On the right, a bearded man wearing a hat and long robes holds a book or scroll and gestures with his other hand, seemingly addressing the figures on the left. A man in the center of the left group, also bearded, kneels and holds a bowl or dish, looking up towards the seated figure. Other men stand behind them, observing the interaction. The architectural setting features a large, decorative arch supported by columns, with a textured background suggesting a wall or drapery. The overall impression is one of a formal gathering or a presentation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a biblical or historical event involving a figure of authority and supplicants. Without specific iconographic clues, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact event, but it could depict a king receiving tribute, a prophet addressing followers, or a scene from the Old Testament. The kneeling figure with the offering suggests a moment of petition or presentation.",
