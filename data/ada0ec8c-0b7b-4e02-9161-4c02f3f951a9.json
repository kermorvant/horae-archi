The figure on the left, dressed in a green mantle over a purple tunic, holds an open book in his left arm and a large, ornate key in his right hand. The figure on the right, wearing a blue mantle over a pink tunic, holds an open book in his left hand and rests his right hand on the hilt of a sword leaning against his side. Behind them, a decorative screen with a geometric pattern of gold squares and red and blue motifs is visible, framed by an arched architectural element. The scene is bordered by decorative elements typical of medieval manuscripts.",
