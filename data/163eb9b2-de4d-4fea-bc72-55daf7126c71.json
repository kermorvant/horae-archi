    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated with the Christ Child on her lap in a lush, green garden. The Christ Child reaches out towards a man who is kneeling in prayer. In the background, a walled garden enclosure is visible, with a small, reddish-brown building topped with a purple roof. A peacock stands prominently in the foreground. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene set in a peaceful, enclosed garden, possibly symbolizing paradise or a sacred space.",
