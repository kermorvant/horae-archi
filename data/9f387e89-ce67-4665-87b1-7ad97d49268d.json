    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts the Virgin Mary, draped in a vibrant blue mantle with gold trim, tenderly holding the Christ Child. The Virgin's head is bowed, her gaze directed downwards, while the Christ Child, depicted with a mature physique, looks towards the viewer. Both figures are enveloped in a golden, radiating halo against a dark blue background, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. Below them, a scroll unfurls with Latin text, partially obscured, but containing the words \"mea sancta ma\" (my holy mother).",
