    "scene_description_enriched": "A tonsured cleric, wearing a red cope with elaborate blue and gold embroidery, kneels in prayer before an altar. The altar is draped with a red cloth adorned with gold patterns and a white cloth on top. Behind the altar, a golden monstrance containing a consecrated host is displayed within an architectural niche. The scene is framed by green curtains and appears to be set within a richly decorated interior, possibly a chapel or church, suggested by the presence of arches and columns in the background.",
