    "scene_description_enriched": "A hunting scene unfolds in a verdant landscape under a starry sky. Several men, some on horseback, are engaged in a stag hunt. The central figure, a man in blue and gold attire with a crown, rides a white horse. To his left, another man in red and blue, holding a spear, blows a horn. In the background, a stag with impressive antlers flees, pursued by several hounds. The landscape is dotted with trees and a path winds through the grassy terrain. In the far left background, a castle with towers is visible.",
