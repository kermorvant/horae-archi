    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. An elderly man, likely a priest, stands with his hands clasped in prayer, wearing ornate religious vestments. Before him is a stone altar with books visible in a recessed compartment. To the right, the Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue, holds the Christ Child, who is adorned with a red beaded necklace. Behind them, several figures observe the event, including a woman in a golden headdress. The setting appears to be an interior space with architectural elements such as columns, arches, and a window with heraldic symbols, suggesting a sacred or noble environment.",
