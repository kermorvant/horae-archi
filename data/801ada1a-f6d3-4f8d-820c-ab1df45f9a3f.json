The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue robe, cradles the Christ Child, who is illuminated by a golden halo. Three Magi approach, bearing gifts in ornate vessels. The first Magus, depicted as black and wearing a blue turban and golden robes, stands with a gift. The second Magus, in a green robe, also holds a gift. The third Magus, in a red robe, kneels before the Virgin and Child, presenting his offering. The architectural setting is rudimentary, with a thatched roof supported by wooden beams and a brick wall visible. A window looks out onto a green landscape.",
