    "scene_description_enriched": "A shepherd, wearing a red cap and a red tunic with gold trim, stands in a rocky, outdoor landscape, holding a staff and accompanied by two sheep. In the background, a crowned figure in a dark robe gestures towards the shepherd. The scene is rendered with vibrant colors and gold leaf accents, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a key event in the Nativity narrative, where angels announce the birth of Christ to shepherds tending their flocks. The crowned figure in the background could represent an angel or a divine messenger.",
