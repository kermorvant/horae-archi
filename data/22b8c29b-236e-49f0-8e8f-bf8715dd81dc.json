He gestures with his right hand towards a wooden tub on the right, which contains three nude children with their hands clasped in prayer. The background is a green, patterned tapestry. This scene depicts Saint Nicholas of Myra, a bishop known for his generosity and protection of children, specifically the legend of him saving three young girls from prostitution by providing dowries, often depicted as them being thrown into a tub or basin.",
