His right hand rests on a chain attached to a key. He is depicted in a richly decorated tunic adorned with circular motifs and a star-like emblem on his sash. Behind him, a window with diamond-shaped panes is visible, suggesting an indoor setting. The man's gesture and attire imply a figure of authority or a specific devotional representation, possibly related to a saint or biblical character associated with judgment or guidance.",
