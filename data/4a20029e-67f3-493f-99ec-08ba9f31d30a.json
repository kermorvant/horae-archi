    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an interior setting, possibly a hall or court. In the center, a bearded man, likely a figure of authority, is seated on a raised platform, holding a staff. He is surrounded by other individuals, some with beards and wearing distinctive headwear, suggesting a gathering of elders or important men. To the left and right of this central group, other figures are present, some engaged in conversation or observation. The architectural elements suggest a structured, possibly public or ceremonial space, with patterned flooring and what appear to be decorative elements or screens behind the seated figure. To the far right, a separate vignette shows a woman holding a flower, possibly representing a different, perhaps devotional, scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The central scene likely represents a moment of judgment, council, or significant discussion involving elders or leaders. The presence of a seated figure with a staff often signifies authority or a presiding role. The vignette on the right, with a woman holding a flower, could be a symbolic representation, perhaps related to purity, a specific saint, or a moment from a biblical narrative. Without further context or clearer iconography, a definitive interpretation is challenging, but it evokes themes of authority, community, and possibly spiritual contemplation.",
