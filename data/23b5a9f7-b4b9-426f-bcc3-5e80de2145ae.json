    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint John the Baptist by his halo and traditional attire, stands within an arched opening. He wears a red tunic and a blue mantle lined with gold, and holds a long staff topped with a spearhead. His gaze is directed outwards, towards a distant landscape featuring a city with towers and spires, rendered in a pale blue and white palette. The interior space is suggested by a patterned red wall behind him and a green checkered floor. The scene is framed by an ornate, illuminated border typical of Books of Hours.",
