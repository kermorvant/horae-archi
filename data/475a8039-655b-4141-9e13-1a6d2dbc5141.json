    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, scourged and bound to a column, enduring torment. Two figures, one in a pink robe and the other in green, appear to be tormentors, with the figure in green holding a whip or similar instrument near Christ's body. A third figure, with a grotesque, demonic appearance, stands to Christ's right, raising a hand as if to strike or pour something upon him. The background is a rich, textured blue, suggesting a divine or symbolic space, with a golden border framing the entire composition. The ground is rendered in a rocky, uneven texture.",
