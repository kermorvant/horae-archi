    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a rural setting with agricultural activities. In the foreground, a woman in a pink dress and white head covering kneels to milk a dark-colored cow, with a bucket placed beneath. A flock of sheep is gathered around, some looking towards the milking activity, while others are entering or exiting a wooden structure. In the background, another woman is visible inside a building, operating a butter churn. Further in the distance, a man is tending to a fence, and beyond that, a town with buildings and a prominent church spire is depicted on a hill. The overall impression is one of daily life and sustenance in a medieval agrarian community.",
