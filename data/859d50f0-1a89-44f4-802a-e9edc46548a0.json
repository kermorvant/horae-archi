    "scene_description_enriched": "Three bearded men are depicted in a scene set against a red, patterned background. The central figure, seated on a rocky outcrop, holds a scroll inscribed with text. A man in a blue robe stands to the left, placing his hands on the shoulders of the central figure. Another man in a blue robe stands to the right, gesturing with his hands as if in prayer or contemplation. The rocky outcrop is rendered in shades of pink and brown, with green ground below. The overall impression is one of counsel, wisdom, or prophecy being shared.",
