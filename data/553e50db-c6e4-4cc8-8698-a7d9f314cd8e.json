    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a landscape setting, framed by ornate architectural borders. In the foreground, a person in a dark, hooded robe with yellow patterned undergarments is seated on a grassy incline, with hands clasped in prayer and head tilted upwards. A red, bird-like creature with outstretched wings is suspended in the air above them, connected by thin red lines. In the background, another figure in a similar robe is seated, facing away from the viewer. The landscape features rolling green hills, distant blue mountains, and a few scattered trees. The overall impression is one of contemplation and perhaps a spiritual vision or encounter.",
