The central figures are engaged in reading from open books. The figure in the orange robe holds an open book with text and is positioned next to a wooden cross-like structure. The figure to his right, in a green robe, also holds an open book adorned with blue and gold stars. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of gold, black, orange, and blue squares, framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs and gold leaf. The ground beneath the figures is a green checkered pattern. The scene is framed by an ornamental border at the top and bottom, featuring gold leaf and intricate designs.",
