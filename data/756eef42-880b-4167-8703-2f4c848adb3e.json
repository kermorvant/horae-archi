In the center, Jesus, identifiable by his halo, is surrounded by several individuals. To his left, a man in blue holds a sword, while another figure in green stands close. To Jesus's right, two men in armor, one with a spear, appear to be guards. In the foreground, a man in a red tunic kneels, reaching towards the fence. The background is a textured gold leaf, suggesting a divine or ethereal realm, contrasting with the earthly garden.",
