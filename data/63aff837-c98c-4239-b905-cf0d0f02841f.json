    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded, elderly man, likely a saint, stands in a landscape, holding an open book. He wears a dark cloak over a tunic. To his left, a wolf is depicted, its head lowered as if drinking or sniffing the ground. Behind the man, to the right, is a simple architectural structure with a rounded archway. The background features trees and foliage, suggesting an outdoor setting. The presence of the wolf is a common attribute for certain saints, particularly those associated with wild animals or monastic life.",
