    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint Andrew by his attribute of the saltire cross, stands in a room with a tiled floor. He is depicted wearing a blue tunic and a red mantle, and he holds an open green book in his hands. Behind him, a large saltire cross leans against a blue tapestry with a gold floral pattern. The room features architectural elements such as a stone wall with brickwork detail, a window with tracery, and a curved archway. The overall setting suggests an interior space, possibly a study or a chapel, where the saint is engaged in contemplation or writing.",
