    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, all with golden halos, are gathered together, looking upwards. In the upper part of the scene, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted within a golden halo, surrounded by blue rays emanating downwards. Below this divine presence, a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends with wings spread. The figures below are dressed in colorful robes, some holding open books. The ground beneath them is a checkered pattern of black, white, and blue squares. The overall scene suggests a divine event occurring in a spiritual realm.",
