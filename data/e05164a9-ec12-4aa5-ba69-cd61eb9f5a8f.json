    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures against a decorative gold and red patterned background. In the upper left, an angel with blue wings and a red halo is shown descending, holding a golden crown. Below, two figures stand side-by-side. The figure on the left, with a green robe and a red undergarment, holds a golden book and a palm frond. The figure on the right wears a blue robe and also holds a palm frond. Both figures have golden halos, suggesting they are saints. The angel appears to be bestowing the crown upon one or both of them. The overall composition suggests a scene of martyrdom or heavenly reward.",
