    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures are depicted within an arched architectural frame. In the foreground, a young person with hands clasped in prayer faces a central figure who stands with arms crossed, wearing a distinctive hat and a long robe. Behind them, several other individuals are visible, some with elaborate headwear. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching for shading. The arched structure above suggests an interior or a framed view of a gathering. The overall composition evokes a devotional or narrative scene, possibly depicting a moment of prayer or supplication before a figure of authority or importance.",
