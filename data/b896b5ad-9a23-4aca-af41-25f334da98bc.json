    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in the foreground, with a prominent figure in the center holding a smaller, unclothed figure. This central figure appears to be a woman, possibly the Virgin Mary, holding the Christ Child. She is surrounded by other individuals, some of whom seem to be looking on with concern or reverence. In the background, a complex architectural cityscape is rendered with multiple buildings, towers, and arched structures, suggesting an urban setting. The overall composition is dense and detailed, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, or a related event from the life of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The presence of the Christ Child being presented, along with other figures, and the backdrop of a city with religious buildings, aligns with such interpretations. The architectural setting could symbolize Jerusalem.",
