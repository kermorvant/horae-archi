    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures, a man and a woman, are depicted in profile, walking outdoors. The man, on the left, has a beard and wears a hooded garment and a netted cap. His hands are clasped in prayer. The woman, on the right, also wears a hooded garment and has her hands clasped in prayer. Both figures carry staffs over their shoulders. Behind them, a lush green tree laden with red fruit is visible on the left, and a mountainous landscape with blue skies and clouds stretches across the background. The scene evokes a sense of pilgrimage or journey undertaken in devotion.",
