    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a martyrdom, likely of Saint Sebastian, given the arrows and the presence of figures associated with his legend. A haloed figure, possibly Saint Sebastian himself, stands on the left, holding a staff and gesturing towards a young man suspended by his arms from a wooden structure supported by columns. This suspended figure is pierced by arrows. To the right, two women observe the scene, one in a yellow robe and purple mantle, the other in a pink robe. A ladder leans against the structure, suggesting the means by which the arrows were inflicted. The background features a stylized landscape with trees and a body of water, and a blue, cloud-like form in the sky. The text below the image contains a rubric and a large illuminated initial 'E'.",
