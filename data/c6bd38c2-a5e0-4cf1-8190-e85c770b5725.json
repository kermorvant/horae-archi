He is clad in armor and a helmet lies at his feet. The background depicts a green landscape with trees and a flock of birds in the sky. On the right, within an architectural setting, a man identified as Jonathan presents a sword to a king identified as Saul. Jonathan is dressed in a blue tunic and red hat, while Saul wears a royal blue robe adorned with gold patterns and a jeweled crown. Several other figures stand behind Saul, also wearing hats. The architectural elements include a column, a window with tracery, and a patterned floor.",
