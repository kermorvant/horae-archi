    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures. The central figure, wearing a bishop's mitre and vestments, appears to be the focus. Two flanking figures, dressed in tunics and caps, are shown supporting or presenting the central figure. The figure on the left has his hand on the chin of the central figure, while the figure on the right has his hand on the shoulder. The central figure's head is slightly tilted back, and his eyes are closed. Above the central figure's head, a circular object, possibly a chalice or a relic, is depicted. The figures are rendered in a stylized, woodcut-like manner, with patterned garments. The background is plain, suggesting an abstract or spiritual setting.",
