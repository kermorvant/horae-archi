    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men, some in armor and others in more elaborate attire. The central figure, with a beard and wearing a distinctive hat, gestures with his hands. To his left, a man in armor holds a sword. To the right, another figure in armor, possibly a guard, stands with a shield. The background suggests an architectural setting with arched elements and decorative motifs, possibly indicating a palace or a grand hall. The overall impression is one of a formal gathering or a scene of authority.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a specific biblical or devotional event that can be definitively identified from the visual cues alone. It appears to be a secular or historical representation, possibly of a king or ruler with his retinue, or a scene from a historical narrative.",
