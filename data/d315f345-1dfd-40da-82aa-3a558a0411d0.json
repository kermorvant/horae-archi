    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a lavish banquet taking place indoors, with numerous figures dressed in rich medieval attire gathered around long tables laden with food. In the background, a military procession is shown outside a fortified city, with soldiers carrying banners and marching towards a castle. Above this, a celestial scene is depicted within an arched structure, featuring constellations, a chariot pulled by winged horses, and figures representing astrological signs. The overall impression is one of earthly celebration and military might juxtaposed with celestial and astrological imagery.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a historical or allegorical event, possibly related to a royal feast or a military campaign, framed by astrological and celestial motifs. The presence of astrological imagery suggests a connection to the influence of the stars on human affairs, a common theme in medieval thought. The banquet and military procession could symbolize earthly power, prosperity, and conflict.",
