    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a man with a beard, wearing a distinctive conical hat with a brim and a tunic. He is holding a quill or stylus in his right hand, poised as if to write or inscribe something. The background is textured with stippling, and architectural elements, specifically an archway with decorative tracery, frame the figure. The overall impression is of a scribe or scholar engaged in intellectual or artistic work within an architectural setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a scribe or a scholar, possibly an author or a figure associated with learning and the creation of manuscripts. Given the context of Books of Hours, this could be a depiction of a saint known for their writings, or a symbolic representation of the act of writing and devotion.",
