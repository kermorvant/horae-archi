    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely Saint Sebastian, bound and pierced by numerous arrows. He stands naked, with his body showing signs of suffering. Three figures surround him: one on the left appears to be shooting an arrow, another in the center is holding a bow, and a third figure stands behind them, looking on. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner. Above them, an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative detailing frames the scene. The background is filled with stippling, suggesting a textured or perhaps a dark, enclosed space.",
