    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Kiss of Judas, a pivotal moment in the Passion of Christ. Jesus, identifiable by his halo and central placement, is being embraced by Judas Iscariot, who is marked by his betrayal. A crowd of soldiers and onlookers surrounds them, some holding weapons like spears. In the foreground, a figure, possibly a soldier or a disciple, is shown falling or being struck down, with a lantern nearby. In the background, architectural elements suggest a town or city, with buildings and possibly a church spire, set against a dark, starry sky. The overall atmosphere is one of turmoil and impending doom.",
