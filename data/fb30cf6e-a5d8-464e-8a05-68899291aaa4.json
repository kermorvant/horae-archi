He is dressed in a robe and mantle, holding an open book in his left hand and gesturing with his right. The background depicts a landscape with hills and a tree, suggesting an outdoor environment. The architecture consists of decorative columns and a pitched roof structure, possibly part of a larger building or a symbolic representation of a sacred space.
