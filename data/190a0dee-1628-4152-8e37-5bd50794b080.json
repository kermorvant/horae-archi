    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, dressed in a richly decorated blue robe with gold trim and a pink collar, stands in a landscape. He is holding a red orb in his left hand and appears to be touching his beard or mouth with his right hand. To his left, a harp lies on the ground. The background features rolling hills, stylized trees, and in the distance, a city with towers and bridges. Birds are depicted in the sky. The scene is likely an illustration of King David, perhaps in a moment of contemplation or playing his harp.",
