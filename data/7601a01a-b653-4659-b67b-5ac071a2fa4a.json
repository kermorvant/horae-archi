    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A bishop, wearing a mitre and cope, holds the Christ Child on a golden altar. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, kneels before him, while another woman, possibly a prophetess, stands behind her, holding a basket with doves. A man in a red hood stands behind the Virgin, looking on. The architectural setting is suggested by columns, an arch, and a window with diamond-shaped panes in the background. The scene is framed by decorative elements of foliage and floral motifs.",
