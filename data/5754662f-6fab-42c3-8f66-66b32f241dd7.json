    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a seated figure, likely a saint or a religious person, within an architectural frame. The figure is shown from the chest up, wearing a cap and a garment with a fur trim. Their hands are clasped in front of them, holding what appears to be a book or scroll. The background is filled with a textured pattern, possibly representing drapery or a stylized natural element. The architectural elements framing the scene suggest a niche or a decorative architectural surround, with curved forms and vertical lines.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's posture and the presence of a book suggest a devotional scene, possibly representing a saint in contemplation or study, or a figure reading scripture. Without further iconographic clues, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it aligns with common depictions of holy figures in medieval art.",
