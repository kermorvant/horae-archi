On the left, a person, likely a man, is seated within a large wooden tub filled with grapes, appearing to be treading them. He wears a simple tunic and a cap. On the right, a woman stands near a leafy bush, holding a small object, possibly a fruit or flower, in her hand. She is dressed in a long, flowing gown. The background is dark, suggesting a nighttime or stylized setting, with some foliage and small plants visible at the bottom.",
