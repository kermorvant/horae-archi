    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with orange wings descends from a blue, star-filled sky, holding a scroll with Latin text. Below, in a pastoral landscape dotted with trees and distant buildings, three figures interact. Two figures, one in blue and the other in orange, appear to be shepherds. The figure in blue, with a beard, is being embraced by the figure in orange. A third figure, also in blue and orange robes, kneels and gently touches a sheep. Several sheep are scattered across the green, grassy terrain. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative floral motifs and gold accents.",
