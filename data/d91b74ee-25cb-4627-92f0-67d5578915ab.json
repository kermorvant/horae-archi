    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, who is reaching out with his right hand. They are seated on a patterned floor, likely within an architectural setting. To the left, a woman in a red gown and black headdress kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, an open loggia reveals a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a winding path. The architecture features large columns supporting arches, and a circular opening is visible in the wall behind the figures.",
