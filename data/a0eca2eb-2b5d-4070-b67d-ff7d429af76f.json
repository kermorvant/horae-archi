    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted in a blue mantle and headdress, sits with her hands clasped in prayer. She gazes down at the Christ Child, who is swaddled in a red cloth and held in her arms. The Christ Child has a halo, as does the Virgin Mary, who also wears a crown. The background is a textured gold leaf, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting, with a green ground beneath the figures. The scene is framed by a border of pink and white.",
