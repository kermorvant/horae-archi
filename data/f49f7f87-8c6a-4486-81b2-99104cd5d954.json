    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely Saint Martha, is depicted anointing a kneeling man with a dark liquid from a vessel. She wears a blue and white robe with gold trim. The man, dressed in white, kneels with clasped hands, his head bowed. Behind him, several other figures, including a woman in a white veil and men with beards, look on with expressions of piety or concern, also with clasped hands. The scene unfolds in an outdoor setting with a rocky outcrop dominating the mid-ground. In the background, a green hillside leads up to a fortified castle with towers and flags. The overall impression is one of a miraculous healing or blessing, possibly related to Saint Martha's legend of taming the Tarasque or her role as a healer.",
