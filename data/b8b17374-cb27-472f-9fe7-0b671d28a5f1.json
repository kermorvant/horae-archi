    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pentecost, with the Virgin Mary seated in the center, hands clasped in prayer, and a book open before her. Around her are the Apostles, some reading, others with hands raised in prayer or awe. Above them, the Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove, radiating golden light. The figures are gathered within an architectural space suggested by arched windows and a red drapery that forms a backdrop. The overall impression is one of spiritual fervor and divine inspiration.",
