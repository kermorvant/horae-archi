    "scene_description_enriched": "Two men are engaged in agricultural labor in a barren landscape. The man on the left, wearing a red tunic and a straw hat, is bent over and appears to be pruning or digging with a large hoe. Beside him lies a wooden log and a white cloth. The man on the right, dressed in a yellow tunic and a black cap, is facing away from the viewer, holding a sickle at his waist. The background depicts a stylized forest of bare trees with green foliage at the top, suggesting a winter or early spring scene. The ground is a muted gray, with some patches of green suggesting sparse vegetation. This scene likely represents the labor of the month of February, a common theme in Books of Hours, symbolizing the agricultural cycle and the hard work required for sustenance.",
