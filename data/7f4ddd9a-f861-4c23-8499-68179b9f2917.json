    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with rolling hills and scattered trees. In the foreground, two figures are engaged in an activity. One figure, possibly a shepherd, is shown bending over, while another figure, perhaps a sheep, is lying down. The overall impression is one of rural tranquility. The scene is framed by an arched border, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
