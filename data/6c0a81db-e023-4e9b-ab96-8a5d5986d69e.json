    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a stylized, heavenly setting. In the foreground, a figure with a halo, presumably Christ, is shown interacting with another figure, possibly a disciple or an angel, who is reaching out to touch his hand. To the left, three bearded men in blue robes stand, one of whom is placing a hand on another's shoulder. A large, open red book rests on the ground in front of them. To the right, two nude figures, possibly representing souls, are being embraced or welcomed. The background is a rich tapestry of red, blue, and gold squares, with a celestial blue expanse above dotted with golden stars and rays of light emanating from a central point.",
