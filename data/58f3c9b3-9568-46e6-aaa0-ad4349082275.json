    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely a saint, stands in a verdant outdoor setting. He wears a monastic habit of deep red over a white tunic and holds an open book in his left hand. In his right hand, he grasps a golden stalk of grain and a rake, suggesting a connection to agriculture or martyrdom. The background features a stylized green tree and a blue sky with distant blue hills. The figure's tonsured hair and halo indicate religious devotion.",
