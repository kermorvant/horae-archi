To her left, a large sword is embedded in the ground, next to a spiked wheel, which is the instrument of her martyrdom. The background features rolling hills, trees, and a stylized, tessellated architectural element above her head, suggesting a divine or heavenly context. The scene is framed by decorative borders typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
