    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the Virgin Mary cradling the body of Jesus, who lies on a draped surface. Several figures surround them, some appearing to mourn or support the deceased. The central group is framed by an architectural element resembling a niche or a stylized archway, with decorative elements suggesting a sacred or monumental setting. On the left and right, figures in distinct attire stand within similar architectural frames, observing the central event. The overall composition is rendered in a woodcut style, with strong outlines and hatching to create shading.",
