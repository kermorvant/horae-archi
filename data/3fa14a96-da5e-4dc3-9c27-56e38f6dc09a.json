    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in a white pleated alb, a richly decorated chasuble with gold and blue patterns, and a jeweled mitre, stands holding a crozier. He is depicted in a portico with large, reddish columns and an ornate entablature, looking towards the viewer. To his right, a green dragon with blue accents, sharp teeth, and wings is chained to him by a red and gold ribbon. Beyond the portico, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills, trees, and a distant city with towers and spires under a bright blue sky. The scene likely represents Saint George, the patron saint of knights and soldiers, triumphing over the dragon, a symbol of evil, with the bishop's vestments signifying his spiritual authority and victory.",
