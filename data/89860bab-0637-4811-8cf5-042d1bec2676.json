    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an arched architectural frame. On the left, a woman wearing a white veil and a pink and grey robe is seated, holding an open book. She has a golden halo around her head. To her right, a younger figure, possibly a girl, kneels and looks towards the seated woman, with one hand reaching towards the book. The background features a blue, patterned drapery behind the seated figure and a pinkish wall behind the kneeling figure. The architectural elements suggest an interior setting, possibly a room or a niche within a larger structure.",
