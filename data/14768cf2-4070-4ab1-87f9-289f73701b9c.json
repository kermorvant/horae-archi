    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with a halo, dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold patterns, kneels on a grassy ground. Her arms are crossed, and her head is bowed. Before her lies an open book. Above and behind her, a golden background is decorated with a grid of blue squares, each containing a small blue flower or star. Rays of orange light emanate from the upper left corner, suggesting divine illumination. This scene likely depicts the Virgin Mary in contemplation or prayer, possibly during the Annunciation or a moment of divine inspiration.",
