    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a single figure, likely a woman, with dark hair and a pale complexion, wearing a white garment draped over her shoulders and chest. Her left arm is extended outwards, with her hand open, while her right hand holds a bundle of cloth or fabric. The background is dark and indistinct, with suggestions of a landscape or architectural forms in the distance, rendered in muted tones. The overall impression is one of solemnity or contemplation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "While the specific scene is not definitively identifiable due to the lack of clear iconographic markers, the figure's posture and attire, along with the contemplative mood, could suggest a devotional scene. Without further context or clearer details, a precise interpretation is not possible. It might represent a saint, a biblical figure, or a symbolic representation.",
