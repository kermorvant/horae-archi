    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her blue mantle and golden halo, meeting Elizabeth, who is dressed in a red robe and white veil, also with a golden halo. They are shown clasping hands in a gesture of greeting or embrace. Behind them, a path winds through a landscape dotted with trees and rolling hills. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible, suggesting a journey or a destination. The overall setting is outdoors, with a sense of movement and encounter between the two figures.",
