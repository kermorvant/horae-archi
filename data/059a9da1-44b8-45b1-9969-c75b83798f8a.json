    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude male figure, depicted with a pale complexion and reddish-brown hair, is shown in a dynamic pose, advancing to the left. He wields a large, dark sword overhead with his right hand, while his left arm is bent, holding a round shield adorned with red and black floral or geometric patterns. The figure's musculature is emphasized, and his abdomen shows a cross-like marking. He stands on a patch of green, suggesting a grassy ground. The background is plain parchment, with a faint horizontal line suggesting a division or horizon.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This depiction likely represents a warrior or a figure engaged in combat. Without further context from the manuscript, it is difficult to assign a specific biblical or devotional meaning. It could potentially symbolize a spiritual battle, a saint in martyrdom, or a more general allegorical representation of struggle.",
