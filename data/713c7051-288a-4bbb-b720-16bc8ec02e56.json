    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a burial service taking place outdoors, with a group of clerics in blue and red robes gathered around an open grave. One cleric, holding a book, appears to be officiating the ceremony, while another, in a blue robe, points with a wand towards the deceased, who lies in a white shroud. Two figures in black monastic habits stand to the right, observing. In the background, a church with spires and arched windows is visible, along with a wall and trees. Tools for digging, a skull, and bones are scattered around the grave, suggesting the context of a cemetery or burial ground.",
