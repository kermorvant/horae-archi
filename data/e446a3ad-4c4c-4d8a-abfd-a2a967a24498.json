    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman, possibly Bathsheba, bathing in a decorative pool, with water cascading from a fountain. She is adorned with a necklace and a cross pendant. To her left, another woman, likely a servant, holds a platter of bread and a mirror. In the background, a king, identifiable by his crown and scepter, observes the scene from an arched opening. Beyond them, a fortified castle with multiple towers and spires dominates the landscape, with a distant city visible on the horizon. The overall setting suggests a royal or noble context, possibly a private garden or courtyard adjacent to a castle.",
