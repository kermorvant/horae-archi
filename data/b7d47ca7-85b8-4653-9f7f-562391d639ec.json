    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a prophet or saint, stands in a landscape, holding a cross. He wears a red tunic and a yellow mantle draped over his shoulders. His right hand is raised, index finger pointing upwards, in a gesture of speech or blessing. The background depicts a blue sky with clouds and green foliage. The scene is framed by ornate, gilded architectural elements on the left and right, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
