On the left, a bearded man with a halo, likely Christ, is seated and gesturing with his left hand. On the right, a woman in a headdress is seated and holding a bucket or pot, appearing to speak. In the background, a pulley system is visible, and beyond that, a cityscape with buildings and towers. A jug sits on the table in the foreground.
