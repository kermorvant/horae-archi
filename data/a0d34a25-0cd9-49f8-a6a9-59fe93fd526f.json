    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a circular frame, suggesting a medallion or a miniature. On the left, a smaller figure with a beard and short hair is shown with hands raised in supplication or awe, wearing a simple robe. Behind this figure, a stylized tree with sparse branches is visible. On the right, a larger, bearded figure with long hair stands, also with hands outstretched, and is depicted with a radiant halo or aura. This figure wears a flowing robe. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, possibly representing a starry sky or a divine presence. The overall composition suggests a divine encounter or revelation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a divine apparition or a moment of spiritual revelation. The larger figure with the halo is indicative of a divine being, possibly God or an angel, appearing to a mortal. The smaller figure's posture suggests reverence and astonishment. Without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific biblical event, but it aligns with themes of prophecy, divine communication, or a saint's vision.",
