    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling on the ground, holding a horn to his lips and pointing with his other hand. He is accompanied by a dog. Behind him, two other figures in white robes stand, one pointing towards the kneeling man. The background shows a wooden structure, possibly a stable or barn, with a glimpse of a landscape with a distant building through an opening. The kneeling man wears a white robe with gold trim and a hood, and the other figures also wear white robes. The overall impression is one of an announcement or a call to attention.",
