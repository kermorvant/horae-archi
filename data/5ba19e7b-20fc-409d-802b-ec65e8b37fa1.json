    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and robes, holds the Christ Child over a baptismal font. The Christ Child is swaddled and has a halo. To the right, a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, receives the child, supported by another figure. The scene takes place indoors, with a patterned floor and a backdrop of striped curtains. The presence of a bishop performing a baptism suggests the Presentation of Christ in the Temple or a related baptismal rite.",
