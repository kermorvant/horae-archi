    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated and reading from an open book placed on a lectern. She wears a blue robe. To her right, an angel, identified by its wings and red robe, kneels and gestures towards Mary, holding a scroll or parchment. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that includes a tall, fluted column with a golden capital and base, and a dark, possibly wooden, background with arched elements suggesting a doorway or screen. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern. To the far left, a green and red structure with golden accents might represent a bed or a piece of furniture.",
