    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men in conversation or negotiation, set against a backdrop of architectural elements suggesting a building. The central figure, a bearded man wearing a turban-like headdress, gestures with his hands. To his left, a man in armor with a helmet holds a staff. To his right, another man, also in armor and a helmet, appears to be listening or observing. The architectural elements include what appear to be building facades with arched openings and decorative elements, possibly representing a city or a grand structure.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a biblical or historical event involving negotiation or judgment, possibly related to figures from the Old Testament or a scene of civic importance. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific interpretation is difficult, but the presence of armored figures and a central, possibly authoritative figure, suggests a moment of decision or discourse.",
