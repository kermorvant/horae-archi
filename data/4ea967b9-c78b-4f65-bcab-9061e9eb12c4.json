    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in the foreground, one reclining and the other standing and gesturing. The reclining figure appears to be ill or distressed, with their head resting on a pillow and their eyes closed. The standing figure, dressed in a hooded garment, has their hands clasped in prayer or supplication and is looking towards the reclining figure. Behind them, a cityscape is rendered with stylized buildings, including towers and arched windows, suggesting an urban setting. The overall composition is framed by architectural elements, possibly representing a niche or a decorative border.",
