    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral landscape, a monk in an orange robe kneels in prayer, his hands clasped. Beside him lies a golden straw hat and a staff. A small dog sits nearby. In the background, sheep graze on a green hillside dotted with trees. To the right, a man in a blue tunic and red trousers, also holding a staff, appears to be working the ground, perhaps digging or tending to something. Above them, in the sky, a winged angel with golden wings and robes descends, holding a scroll with an inscription. The scene evokes a sense of divine intervention or blessing upon humble labor and devotion.",
