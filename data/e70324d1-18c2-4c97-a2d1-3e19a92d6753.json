    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. Christ, seated on a throne-like structure, places a crown upon the head of the kneeling Virgin Mary. Rays of divine light descend from a celestial realm above, where three figures, possibly representing the Holy Trinity or angels, are visible. An angel with red wings stands behind the Virgin, holding a crown, while another angel plays a harp to the right of Christ. Two other figures, one in red and one in blue, stand to the left of the Virgin. The setting appears to be a raised platform within an architectural space, suggested by the presence of a green curtain behind Christ and the checkered floor.",
