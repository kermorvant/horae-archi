    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a saint, stands in a landscape. He wears a black hooded robe with gold trim over a patterned blue tunic and red shoes. A blue halo encircles his head, and he holds a hammer in his right hand and a staff in his left. Beside him, a small brown animal, possibly a dog or a fox, looks towards him. Behind the figure, a red curtain with gold ornamentation is visible, suggesting an indoor setting or a symbolic representation. To the right, a simplified rural landscape unfolds with rolling green hills, a path, and a small, rustic building with a pitched roof. The overall scene is rendered in a stylized, medieval manner.",
