    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, with a halo and dressed in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Beside her stands a donkey. To the right, Saint Joseph, also with a halo and praying, is dressed in a red robe. Between them, lying on a straw-filled manger lined with white cloth, is the Christ Child, radiating golden light. Behind the figures, a simple wooden structure with a thatched roof suggests a stable. In the background, dark, rocky hills are visible against a blue sky with rays of divine light descending.",
