Three Magi are present: one kneels before them, wearing a crown and a red and green robe; another, dressed in a patterned robe and a distinctive hat with a cross, stands holding a golden vessel; and a third, in a blue robe and orange hat, also holds a golden vessel. The background is a stone wall, and the roof of the stable is visible with wooden beams. A red cloth with gold patterns hangs from the ceiling.",
