    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures, likely monks or clergy, are depicted kneeling with their hands clasped in prayer. They are dressed in distinct religious garments: one in a red tunic, another in a blue tunic with yellow trim, and the foremost figure in a cream-colored robe with yellow trim. The figures are shown in profile, facing towards the right of the frame. The scene appears to be set in an unspecified location, possibly within a religious building, given the attire of the individuals. The overall impression is one of devotion and supplication.",
