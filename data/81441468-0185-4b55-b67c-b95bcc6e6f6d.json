    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a man wearing a dark cap with ear flaps and a fur-trimmed hood over a pink garment with white cuffs. He has a dark complexion and appears to be gesturing with his right hand, pointing with his index finger. The background is a vibrant blue, and the scene is framed by an ornamental border featuring green foliage and red and blue floral elements. The man's attire suggests a person of some status. While no specific religious narrative is evident, the style of illumination and the devotional context of Books of Hours often feature portraits of donors or saints.",
