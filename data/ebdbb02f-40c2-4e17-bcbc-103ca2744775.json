    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, identified as Saint Bartholomew, stands within an architectural setting. He is depicted with a halo, indicating sainthood, and holds a book under his left arm and a long staff with a blade-like object in his right hand, possibly representing his martyrdom instrument. He wears a red tunic beneath a flowing blue mantle. The background features architectural elements suggestive of a church interior, with pointed arches supported by columns, and windows with tracery. The floor is tiled in a yellow grid pattern. The scene is framed by an ornate border with decorative motifs.",
