    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bearded man, likely a monk or hermit, wearing a hooded robe and a hat. He is shown in profile, looking upwards and to the right, with his hands clasped together in prayer or contemplation. He holds a book or scroll in his left arm. The figure is framed by architectural elements: on the left, a decorative arch with foliage motifs, and on the right, a column. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a textured surface or a stylized representation of nature.",
