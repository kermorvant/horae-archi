    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts an interior architectural space, likely a church or chapel, characterized by Gothic architectural elements. Multiple pointed arches are visible, supporting what appears to be a vaulted ceiling. Intricate tracery adorns the upper sections of the architecture, suggesting a sophisticated design. A heavy curtain hangs centrally, obscuring a portion of the view and creating a sense of mystery or privacy. The overall impression is one of solemnity and grandeur, typical of religious edifices.",
