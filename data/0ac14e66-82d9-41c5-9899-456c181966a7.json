    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in front of a building with red tiled roofs and arched windows, set against a backdrop of blue and gold patterned fabric. In the foreground, a man in a pink robe, identified as Christ, holds a chalice and appears to be speaking or gesturing. To his left, a man in a red robe holds a book. To Christ's right, a man in a yellow robe with a blue hood points outwards, addressing a group of onlookers. Below them, a man in a blue tunic and red hose lies prostrate, supported by another figure in a green tunic. The architectural elements suggest a town or city setting, with the patterned fabric possibly representing an interior or a decorative screen.",
