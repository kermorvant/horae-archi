    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body showing signs of suffering. A scroll with text is draped over the cross. To the left, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, stands with her hands clasped, accompanied by another figure. To the right, a man in a red and yellow robe points upwards and gestures, seemingly addressing Christ, while other figures stand behind him. The background features a green, hilly landscape with distant architectural structures, possibly a city or town, under a blue sky dotted with stars and a crescent moon.",
