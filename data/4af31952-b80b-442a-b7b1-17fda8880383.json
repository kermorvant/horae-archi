    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely Pontius Pilate, seated and wearing a blue robe and a distinctive hat. A servant in a red tunic stands to his left, holding a ewer and a basin, seemingly preparing to wash hands. To the right, Jesus, crowned with thorns and bleeding, is being led forward by two figures, one in armor and another in a purple robe. Jesus's face shows suffering, and his hands are bound. The setting appears to be an interior space with a wooden door and wall.",
