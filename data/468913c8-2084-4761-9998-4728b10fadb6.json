He wears a golden tunic and a rich red cloak, with his bare feet visible. Beside him, a large bird, possibly an eagle, stands attentively. The background features a dense forest of trees, transitioning to a landscape with water, rocky outcrops, and distant castles. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
