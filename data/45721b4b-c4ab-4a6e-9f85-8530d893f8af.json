    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act within a courtyard setting, framed by an arched architectural element. In the foreground, a woman kneels, cradling an infant, while another man in a golden tunic raises a sword, seemingly to strike. A second man in an orange tunic stands nearby, holding a staff that appears to be impaling a fallen infant on the ground. In the background, a building with a gabled roof and timber framing is visible, along with a fence and other figures engaged in activity. The overall impression is one of brutality and distress, likely representing a biblical narrative of infanticide.",
