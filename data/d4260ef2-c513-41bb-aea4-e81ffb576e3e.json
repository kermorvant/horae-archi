    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a saint or prophet, in a state of divine inspiration or contemplation, with their head tilted back and one arm raised. They are seated next to a wooden lectern with a book open, suggesting study or prayer. To the left, a lion rests on a tiled floor, its gaze directed towards the seated figure. The background features architectural elements, including a large, textured wall with what appears to be a column and an arch, suggesting an interior or a partially enclosed space. The overall atmosphere is one of spiritual reflection and divine encounter.",
