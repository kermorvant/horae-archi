    "scene_description_enriched": "A close-up view of a manuscript illumination shows a dark, looped element with a gold fill, possibly representing a key or part of a decorative border. Adjacent to this is a vibrant blue form, likely depicting drapery or a stylized element of a figure. To the right, hints of red and yellow pigment suggest further decorative or figural elements. The background is a textured white, typical of parchment, with scattered gold leaf flecks.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The image fragment does not contain enough information to interpret a specific religious, biblical, liturgical, or devotional meaning. It appears to be a decorative or figural detail from a larger illumination.",
