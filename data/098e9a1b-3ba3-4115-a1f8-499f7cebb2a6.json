    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine communication. On the left, a figure in a dark robe and white wimple kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Above and to the left, a bearded figure with a golden halo, dressed in blue, gestures with his right hand, from which rays of light emanate towards the right. On the right, a crowned female figure, also with a golden halo, stands with arms outstretched and palms facing upwards, receiving the divine light. She wears a light-colored gown and a blue mantle. Beside her, a lectern holds an open book with musical notation. The background is a patterned gold fabric, suggesting an interior or a divine setting. The floor is rendered with a diamond pattern.",
