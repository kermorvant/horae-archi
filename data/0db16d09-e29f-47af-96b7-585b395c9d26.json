    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female figure, likely a saint or queen, stands within a decorative architectural frame. She is depicted frontally, wearing a long, draped garment and holding a palm frond in her left hand and a sword in her right. To her left, a wheel is visible, a common attribute of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The background is stylized with diagonal lines, suggesting a decorative or symbolic setting rather than a realistic one. The overall impression is that of a devotional image, possibly representing a saintly figure.",
