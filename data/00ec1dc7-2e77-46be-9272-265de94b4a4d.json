    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity in a symbolic representation. God the Father, crowned and bearded, holds the crucified Christ, whose body is depicted in a stylized manner. The Holy Spirit is suggested by a dove-like form above Christ's head, though not explicitly rendered as a distinct figure. Below, a seated figure, likely a prophet or saint, is shown in prayer or contemplation, holding a scroll with the inscription \"Et deus erat\". The background is a dark, starry sky, with a stylized landscape featuring trees and a small building in the distance. A band with Latin inscriptions encircles the scene, reading \"GLORIA PATRI ET FILIO ET SPIRITUI SANCTO\" and \"VERBVM CARO FACTVM EST\".",
