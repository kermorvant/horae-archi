    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an architectural setting. On the left, a tonsured cleric in a monastic habit holds a censer, gesturing towards a central figure. This central figure, a bearded man in elaborate robes, appears to be officiating or receiving something from the cleric. To the right, a young woman in a white garment stands behind a stone structure, possibly an altar or a baptismal font, with another robed figure behind her. The architecture features pointed arches and decorative elements, suggesting a Gothic style. The overall scene likely represents a sacrament or a significant religious event.",
