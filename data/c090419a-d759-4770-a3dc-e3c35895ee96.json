    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a banquet or feast within an opulent interior. At a long table covered with a white cloth, a man and a woman are seated, engaged in eating. The woman, dressed in blue and gold, holds a knife and bread. The man, in a golden robe and blue hat, also has food before him. To the left, a woman with long blonde hair presents a platter with a severed head, likely that of John the Baptist, to the seated figures. A group of onlookers stands behind her. The architecture features large, ornate columns with sculpted figures and elaborate capitals, supporting a richly decorated canopy above the table. A window in the background reveals a landscape. The floor is tiled with fleur-de-lis motifs. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
