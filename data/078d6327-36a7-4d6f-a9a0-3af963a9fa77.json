    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross against a deep blue, star-speckled sky. Below, a group of mourners gathers. To the left, the Virgin Mary, veiled in blue, is comforted by another woman. To the right, Mary Magdalene, in a red robe, is embraced by another woman, possibly Saint John. A figure in green, possibly a disciple, reaches up towards Christ's feet. In the background, a detailed cityscape with towers and domes is visible, suggesting Jerusalem, with a crowd and soldiers gathered below the hill.",
