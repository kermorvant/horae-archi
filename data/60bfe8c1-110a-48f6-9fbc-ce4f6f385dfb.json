    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a single figure, a man with a long, wavy beard and hair, wearing a hat with a brim and a decorative element on top. He is dressed in a long robe with ornate cuffs. His hands are clasped in front of him, and the robe drapes around his legs. The figure is framed by decorative borders, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript or printed book. The style is characteristic of medieval woodcuts or engravings.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a prophet or a biblical figure, possibly from the Old Testament, given the beard and traditional attire. Without further context from the manuscript, a specific interpretation is not possible, but it could be an illustration for a psalm, a prophecy, or a genealogical tree of biblical characters.",
