Saint Christopher, a bearded man with a staff, is depicted with his legs submerged in blue water, suggesting a river or sea crossing. He wears a golden tunic and a red cloak. The Christ Child, seated on Saint Christopher's head, is crowned and holds a globe, radiating light. In the background, a monastic building with a red roof is visible on a hill, with a robed monk carrying a lantern. Further in the distance, a fortified castle with spires stands on another hill, overlooking a body of water. The scene is framed by ornate golden columns decorated with figures and foliage.",
