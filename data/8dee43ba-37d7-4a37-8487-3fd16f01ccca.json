    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a saint or cleric, stands in a landscape, holding an open book in their left hand and a grid-like object, possibly a gridiron, in their right. The figure wears a long, reddish-purple robe adorned with gold patterns over a white undergarment. In the background, several stylized castles or towers are visible amidst rolling green hills and foliage under a blue sky. The scene is framed by an ornate, golden architectural element, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
