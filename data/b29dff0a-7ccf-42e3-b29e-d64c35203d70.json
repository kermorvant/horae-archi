    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in a landscape setting. On the left, a man with a beard and wearing a cap prays with his hands clasped. In the center, a figure in a hooded robe also appears to be praying or pleading. On the right, another man with a beard, dressed in dark robes, kneels with his hands clasped, looking upwards. Behind him, a large, indistinct form, possibly representing a burden or a struggle, is visible. The overall impression is one of supplication and hardship. The scene is likely a representation of David in prayer, possibly during a time of persecution or penitence, as suggested by the figures' postures and expressions of distress.",
