    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, identified as David, kneels in prayer, his hands clasped and his gaze directed upwards. He is dressed in a blue robe with gold trim and a fur-lined collar, kneeling on a red cloak. Beside him, a crown rests on a white cushion, and a harp is visible. In the background, a celestial scene unfolds with God the Father, depicted as an elderly bearded figure with a halo, bestowing a blessing or instruction. An angel, with outstretched wings and holding a sword, descends from above, seemingly directed towards a distant castle. The scene is framed by ornate architectural elements on the left, suggesting an interior setting, while the background depicts an outdoor landscape with trees and a castle.",
