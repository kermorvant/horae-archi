    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided by a large column. On the left, a bearded man wearing a blue robe adorned with gold patterns and a red and gold crown stands outdoors, looking upwards and touching his crown. He is identified by the inscription 'DAVID' at his feet. Behind him, a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a distant castle with spires is depicted. To the right of the column, a nun in a black habit and white wimple kneels indoors, reading from an open book. She is holding a rosary. Above her, a banner displays the inscription 'DOMER PLAUD'. The interior features a tiled floor, a wooden structure that appears to be an altar or lectern, and windows with diamond-shaped tracery. The overall scene suggests a juxtaposition of the earthly realm and spiritual devotion.",
