To her left is a humble dwelling with a thatched roof and an open doorway. Three Magi are present: one kneels before Mary and the Child, offering a gift; another stands holding a golden vessel; and a third, richly dressed, stands to the right holding a chalice. A star shines brightly in the sky above, symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem. The background features a stylized landscape with trees and hills.",
