The robed figure, possibly a priest or saint, is accompanied by an angel holding a golden pitcher and a paten with bread. The woman inside the tower is depicted with a halo and clasped hands in prayer, suggesting she is a saint or a devout individual in confinement. The exterior setting shows a landscape with distant buildings and hills. The overall scene evokes a spiritual nourishment or a divine visitation within a context of imprisonment or isolation.",
