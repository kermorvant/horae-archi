    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a circular frame. On the left, a bearded male figure with a halo holds a staff and gestures towards the right. He is robed and appears to be speaking. On the right, a female figure with a veiled head and clasped hands in prayer looks towards the male figure. She is also robed. Behind them, a curtain or drapery is visible, suggesting an interior setting. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, possibly representing a starry sky or a divine presence. The overall composition suggests a significant religious encounter.",
