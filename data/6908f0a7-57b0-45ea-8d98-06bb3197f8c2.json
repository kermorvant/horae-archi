    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a rocky hillside where Christ, with a halo and radiant light emanating from his head, is handing a book to a kneeling figure. Christ is dressed in a long, grey robe with gold embellishments, and the kneeling figure, likely a disciple or prophet, wears a blue tunic and a gold mantle, also holding a book. To the right, a crowd of people, some with halos, are gathered, looking towards Christ and the kneeling figure. The landscape is rendered with rolling green hills, scattered trees and bushes, and a distant view of a body of water and possibly some buildings. The sky is a pale blue with stylized clouds highlighted with gold.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents Christ giving the Law or divine knowledge to Moses, or possibly another prophet or disciple. The presence of multiple figures with halos suggests a significant religious event, possibly related to the Old Testament or the early Church.",
