    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a halo and green wings, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer. She is dressed in a blue robe. Before her is a lectern covered with a golden cloth, upon which rests an open book with text. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, also with green wings, kneels and gestures towards Mary. He is dressed in a peach-colored robe over a white garment. Above Gabriel, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light emanating from it. The background features a window looking out onto a cityscape. The entire scene is framed by an arched architectural element with decorative motifs.",
