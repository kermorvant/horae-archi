    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded, haloed elder, likely a hermit or saint, sits on a woven stool, holding an open book and a small bell. He is dressed in a purple robe. To his right, a small pig walks on a path. Behind him, a large tree stands beside a stone church with a rose window and a steeply pitched roof. The church is adjacent to a building with a timber-framed upper story. The setting is a rocky, hilly landscape with patches of green grass.",
