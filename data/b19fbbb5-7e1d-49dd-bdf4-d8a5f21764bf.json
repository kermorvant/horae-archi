    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, seated on a donkey, cradles the Christ Child. She is dressed in a vibrant blue mantle. Leading the donkey is an older man, presumably Saint Joseph, wearing a dark robe and a red cloak. They are traveling through a landscape with rocky formations on the left and a city with towers and blue-domed buildings in the background. The ground is green and uneven, with some scattered foliage.",
