    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a chaotic scene with multiple figures in distress. In the foreground, a man with a cap is looking upwards, seemingly in supplication or fear. Above him, a larger figure, possibly a woman, is shown with arms raised, her body contorted. The background is filled with a dense pattern of dots, suggesting a tumultuous or crowded environment. To the lower right, a small animal, possibly a dog or a fox, is visible. The overall impression is one of struggle or a dramatic event unfolding.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too fragmented and lacks clear iconographic markers to definitively interpret a specific religious or biblical event. The distressed figures and chaotic composition might suggest a scene of martyrdom, a battle, or a moment of divine intervention, but without further context or clearer imagery, any interpretation would be speculative.",
