    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man with a tonsure, wearing a simple tunic, is seated and reading an open book. He gestures with his right hand, palm open, as if in supplication or explanation. He is surrounded by other figures, some of whom are also holding books or have their hands clasped in prayer. The scene appears to be set within an architectural context, suggested by the drapery and the implied presence of a larger gathering, though no specific architectural elements are clearly depicted. The overall impression is one of scholarly or devotional contemplation within a communal setting.",
