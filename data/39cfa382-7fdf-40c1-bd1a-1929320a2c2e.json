    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Baptism of Christ. John the Baptist, kneeling on a green hill, pours water from a vessel onto the head of Christ, who stands in the river Jordan. Christ is partially submerged and wrapped in a white cloth. Above them, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove, surrounded by rays of light. In the upper register, God the Father, enthroned and holding a globe, is flanked by two angels. The background features a lush landscape with trees, rolling hills, and a distant city with towers and domes.",
