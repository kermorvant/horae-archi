Mary's left hand rests on her abdomen, indicating her pregnancy. They are in an outdoor setting with rolling green hills, scattered trees with white blossoms, and a body of water in the background. In the far distance, a city with towers and spires is visible under a blue sky with a crescent moon. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative foliage.",
