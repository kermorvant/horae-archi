    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity, with God the Father and God the Son seated side-by-side, and the Holy Spirit as a dove descending between them. They are positioned above the Virgin Mary, who is shown in prayer with her hands clasped. God the Father holds a book, while God the Son holds a globe surmounted by a cross. Surrounding the central figures are rows of people, depicted in stylized orange robes, suggesting a heavenly host or congregation. Below, on the left, a group of men are gathered, one holding what appears to be the Ten Commandments tablets, and another holding a scroll or document. On the right, a king plays a harp, accompanied by other figures. The overall composition suggests a divine revelation or a scene of worship.",
