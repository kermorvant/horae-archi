Above them, a figure in a red robe with a halo, identified as God, reaches down. Another figure, dressed in blue and gold, is on a ladder, seemingly assisting in the process. The background is a rich red tapestry with a repeating pattern of gold circles and squares, and a blue starry cloth above. The lower portion of the scene shows a green grassy ground.",
