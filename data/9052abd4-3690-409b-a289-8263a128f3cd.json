    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a golden halo and flowing red hair, tenderly holds the Christ Child, who also has a golden halo. They are seated on a richly patterned floor. Behind them, a wooden structure with circular openings and a pink cushion suggests a domestic setting. To the right, a blue brick wall rises, with a tall, arched window featuring diamond-shaped tracery. A blue staircase ascends along the wall. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
