    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, possibly a saint or a deceased person, lying on the ground, adorned in rich, golden vestments. Above, in a celestial realm suggested by a blue sky and golden border, a figure with hands clasped in prayer is depicted, flanked by two large, blue, winged figures, likely angels. In the middle ground, a stylized landscape unfolds with rolling green hills and distant blue mountains. A white, pointed structure, resembling a small chapel or a tomb, stands prominently in the middle ground, partially obscuring the landscape. The overall impression is one of spiritual transition or divine intervention.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the \"Death of a Saint\" or a \"Vision of the Afterlife.\" The figure in golden vestments could be a saint in repose or at the moment of death, with the angels signifying their ascent to heaven. The praying figure in the sky might represent the soul's journey or a divine being receiving the soul. The architectural elements, particularly the pointed structure, could symbolize a tomb or a heavenly dwelling.",
