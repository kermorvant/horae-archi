    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with a group of figures gathered around the body of Christ as it is laid in a sarcophagus. Christ's body, showing wounds from crucifixion, is held by several mourners. A woman in a blue mantle, likely the Virgin Mary, cradles his arm, while another figure in red supports his legs. The background features a stylized landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a distant city under a blue sky with golden rays emanating from above. The figures are rendered with expressive faces and draped robes, conveying sorrow and grief.",
