    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. A newborn Christ Child lies on the ground, radiating light, surrounded by small figures and what appear to be architectural elements in the background. To the right, the Virgin Mary, wearing a dark robe and a halo, gazes downwards. To her left, an older man with a beard, possibly Saint Joseph, dressed in a monastic habit, gestures with his hand. The background is dark and suggests an interior space with some rudimentary architectural structures.",
