    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a crowned figure, likely a queen or a saintly woman, standing within an architectural frame. She wears a jeweled crown and a mantle over a richly decorated garment. Her left hand holds a tall, flaming torch, while her right hand points outwards. The architectural setting is suggested by an arched structure above, adorned with decorative elements, and a simple, flat base below. The overall impression is one of regal or spiritual authority, possibly representing a martyr or a figure associated with divine light or guidance.",
