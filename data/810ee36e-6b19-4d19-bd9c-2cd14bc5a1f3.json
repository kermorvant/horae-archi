    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine figure, likely God the Father, seated on a throne with a golden orb in his left hand and his right hand raised in blessing. He is adorned with a red cloak over a golden robe and a papal tiara. Flanking him are two red-winged seraphim. The central image is framed by a diamond shape with a blue, star-filled background. In the upper left corner, an angel with red wings holds a scroll. In the upper right, a bird-like creature, possibly an eagle, also holds a scroll. In the lower left, a winged lion sits, and in the lower right, a winged lamb reclines, both holding scrolls. The overall composition suggests a celestial or divine setting, possibly representing the majesty of God and the evangelists or symbolic representations of divine power.",
