    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint John the Baptist, stands in a landscape with a golden background. He is depicted wearing a purple robe with a red undergarment and holds a lamb in his arms. The lamb is a symbol of Christ, often referred to as the \"Lamb of God.\" The scene is framed by decorative borders, suggesting it is an illustration from a manuscript, likely a Book of Hours. The sparse vegetation and the golden background indicate a stylized, rather than realistic, setting.",
