    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, accompanied by two other female figures, standing on a patterned floor. In the background, a building with arched windows and a tower is visible. To the right, a man points towards a bed or altar-like structure, where another figure, possibly a king or bishop, is lying down. The sky above is filled with stars. This scene is likely an interpretation of the Nativity or a related event, possibly the Adoration of the Magi, given the presence of figures and the architectural setting.",
