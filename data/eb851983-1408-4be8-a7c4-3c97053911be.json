    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely a saint, stands with a beard and a cap, holding a small scroll or tablet in his left hand and a bird perched on his right hand. He wears a hooded cloak over a tunic and hose. The figure stands on a patterned floor composed of black and white triangles. The background consists of text, suggesting this is an illustration from a manuscript. The presence of a bird and the saintly depiction strongly suggest an iconographic representation of Saint Francis of Assisi, known for his affinity with animals.",
