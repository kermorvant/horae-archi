    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony, likely the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. On the left, a bishop, identifiable by his mitre and vestments, presides over an altar draped with white and blue cloths. To the right of the altar, a man in a brown monastic habit holds the Christ Child, who is naked and has a halo. Kneeling before him is the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold patterns, also with a halo. Behind her stands a woman in an orange dress and a white headdress, possibly a prophetess or attendant. The background suggests an interior space with wooden paneling and a doorway.",
