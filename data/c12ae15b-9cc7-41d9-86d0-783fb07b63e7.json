To his left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in blue and white, with a sorrowful expression. To his right stands a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, in a blue robe and red cloak, looking upwards. The background features a turbulent sky with golden wavy lines, and a green, hilly landscape below. At the foot of the cross, a skull and bones are visible, symbolizing Golgotha. The inscription 'INRI' is present above Christ's head.",
