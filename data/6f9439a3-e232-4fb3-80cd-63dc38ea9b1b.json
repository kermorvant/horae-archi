    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable, suggested by the wooden beams and dark, rough walls. The Virgin Mary, with long auburn hair and a serene expression, is draped in a blue mantle. Beside her, Saint Joseph, with a white beard and clasped hands in prayer, gazes down. Between them, the Christ Child lies on a white cloth, radiating a golden light. A donkey's head is visible behind Mary. The scene is framed by an arched wooden structure, and through an opening, a pastoral landscape with rolling hills and trees is visible under a blue sky. Golden rays emanate from the Christ Child, symbolizing divine light, and also from above, suggesting heavenly intervention. The lower part of the image contains a decorated initial 'D' and Latin text, typical of a Book of Hours.",
