    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ in prayer, kneeling with clasped hands in a garden enclosed by a wooden fence. Three disciples, identified by their halos, are seated behind him, one appearing to sleep. In the background, a hilly landscape is dotted with trees and a walled city with domed buildings. Above, in a blue oval, a bust of God the Father is shown, with a chalice and host on a rocky outcrop to the right, symbolizing the divine presence and the Eucharist. The overall scene represents the Agony in the Garden, a moment of intense prayer and foreboding before Christ's arrest.",
