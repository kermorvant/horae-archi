    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man kneeling on the right, with his hands clasped in prayer or supplication. He is dressed in a flowing robe. To his left, three figures stand together, also appearing to be in a state of reverence or petition. Behind them, architectural elements suggest buildings with arched openings and tiered structures, possibly representing a city or religious complex. The overall impression is one of a devotional gathering or a plea being made.",
