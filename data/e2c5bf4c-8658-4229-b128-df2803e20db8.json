    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, adorned in a blue cloak with gold embellishments and a red tunic, kneels and gestures towards the Virgin Mary. He has wings and golden hair. The Virgin Mary, seated on a throne-like chair and dressed in a blue robe with a white veil, holds an open book. Behind them, a crowd of figures, likely representing onlookers or a congregation, are visible. The background opens to a landscape seen through an arched portal, where a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The architecture features classical columns and statues, suggesting a noble or sacred interior.",
