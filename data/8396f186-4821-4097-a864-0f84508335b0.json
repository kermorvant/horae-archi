    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, depicted with a head covering and flowing robes, is shown cradling a small animal, possibly a lamb, in her arms. Her gaze is directed downwards towards the animal. To her right, a stylized plant with large leaves is visible. The scene is framed by decorative borders, suggesting it is an illustration within a manuscript. The overall impression is one of tenderness and care, with the woman's posture conveying a sense of protection towards the creature. The presence of the lamb strongly suggests a religious context, likely referencing Christ as the Lamb of God or a depiction of a saint associated with lambs.",
