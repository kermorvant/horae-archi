    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts Saint Sebastian, a male figure with blond hair and a halo, pierced by numerous arrows. His torso is visibly wounded, with blood flowing from the wounds. He is draped in a white cloth around his lower body. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an archway, with a golden border. Behind the figure, a landscape with green fields and a blue sky with clouds is visible. The figure's posture and the arrows suggest martyrdom.",
