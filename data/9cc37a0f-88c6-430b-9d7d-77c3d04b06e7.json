    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an interior setting. In the foreground, three figures stand together, two in armor and one in a long robe, with the central figure wearing a halo. To the right, another figure is seated, wearing a hat and holding a sword, gesturing towards the standing figures. The floor is tiled, and a small golden object, possibly a chalice, rests on a golden base. The background is partially obscured by drapery, suggesting an indoor space, possibly a tent or a room with curtains.",
