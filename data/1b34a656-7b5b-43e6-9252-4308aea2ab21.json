    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Raising of Lazarus, with Christ, identified by his halo and blue robe, gesturing towards a sarcophagus. Lazarus, pale and wrapped in white linen, is shown partially raised from the sarcophagus, his eyes open. Mourners, some in distress, surround the scene. To the left, a partially ruined architectural structure, possibly a tomb or a symbolic representation of death, stands against a vibrant blue, patterned background. The architecture features arches, columns, and windows with tracery, suggesting a Gothic style. The overall setting is a green landscape with stylized trees.",
