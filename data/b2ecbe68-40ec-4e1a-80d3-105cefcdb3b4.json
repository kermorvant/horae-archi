    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting framed by Gothic arches and decorative elements. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a halo, is seated, her hands crossed over her chest, and a book open before her. To her right, the Angel Gabriel, with green wings and holding a staff, kneels and gestures towards Mary, with a scroll emanating from his mouth bearing text. Behind them, an architectural structure with columns and arches is visible, and in an upper niche, a figure of God the Father is depicted with hands raised in blessing. The overall scene is rendered with vibrant colors and intricate details characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
