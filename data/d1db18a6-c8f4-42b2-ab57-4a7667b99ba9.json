    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely Saint John the Baptist, stands in a verdant landscape under a starry blue sky. He wears a golden robe and a pink mantle, and holds a white lamb on his left arm, pointing at it with his right index finger. The lamb looks upwards. In the background, a river flows, and a walled city with towers and spires is visible on a hill. Several smaller figures, some with halos, are depicted in the middle ground, walking along a path or near the river. The overall scene evokes a pastoral and spiritual setting.",
