    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with red wings and a pink robe, kneels and gestures towards the Virgin Mary. He holds a scroll with text. The Virgin Mary, seated on the right in a purple robe, holds a red book and raises her hand in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. She is positioned within a structure that appears to be a room or a niche, with decorative carvings on the wall. Above the main scene, a frieze of four angels is visible, leaning over a ledge. The overall scene is framed by decorative borders.",
