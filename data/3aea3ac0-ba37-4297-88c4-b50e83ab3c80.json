    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man kneeling in prayer, with his hands clasped and his gaze directed upwards. He is dressed in a long, ornate robe with fur trim and a crown rests on the ground before him. To his left, a harp is visible. In the background, a rocky landscape transitions to a pastoral setting with trees and a winding path leading to a cluster of buildings with spires. Above, in a celestial realm depicted with clouds and stars, Christ is shown gesturing towards the praying man, with rays of light descending. The overall scene suggests a divine revelation or a moment of intense spiritual communion.",
