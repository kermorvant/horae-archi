He is shown from the chest up, with his torso bare, revealing wounds and marks of suffering. His hands are bound together with a rope. The figure is positioned between two architectural elements: on the left, a column with a rope tied around it, and on the right, another column. The background is plain, with a horizontal line suggesting a surface or platform.",
