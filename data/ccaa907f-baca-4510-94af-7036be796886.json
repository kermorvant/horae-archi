He is seated on a golden throne-like structure. To his left, a kneeling woman, identified as the Virgin Mary, wears a golden dress and a white mantle, her hands clasped. Above and behind her, an angel with pink robes and wings descends, holding a golden crown. The background features architectural elements suggesting a divine or royal setting, with blue drapery adorned with gold patterns, and hints of arched structures and crenellations. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern of white, green, and red.",
