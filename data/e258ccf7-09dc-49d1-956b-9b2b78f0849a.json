    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large white wings and a golden staff, approaches the Virgin Mary. He is dressed in a flowing grey robe. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is kneeling and looking towards the angel with her hands raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. She wears a yellow tunic and a blue mantle. Above her, the Holy Spirit is represented as a dove descending with rays of light. The background features architectural elements including a window with a grid pattern, a green curtain, and a bed with red drapery. A wooden structure with arched openings is visible behind the angel. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern.",
