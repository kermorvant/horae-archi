    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ within a rustic, partially constructed building. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies on a simple cloth on the ground. Saint Joseph, with a halo and a red robe, sits to the left, looking towards the child. An ox and a donkey are present, their heads bowed. The background shows a window with a view of a blue sky and water, and the architectural elements suggest a stable or a humble dwelling under construction, with exposed wooden beams and a partially open doorway.",
