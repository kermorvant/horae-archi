    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men are depicted in a scene set against a red, textured background with gold and grey accents, possibly representing clouds or a rich tapestry. In the foreground, a man with a blue cap and a long blue robe, adorned with gold patterns, points emphatically towards another man. This second man, dressed in a golden-brown robe, looks towards the first man. To the left, several other men, one in a pink robe and another in a golden robe, are shown with expressions of concern or reverence, with one clasping his hands in prayer. The ground is depicted as green with small white flowers, suggesting an outdoor setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The gesture of pointing and the reactions of the onlookers suggest a moment of revelation, judgment, or instruction. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific biblical or devotional scene is difficult to pinpoint. However, the composition evokes themes of prophecy, divine pronouncement, or a significant event being conveyed to a group.",
