    "scene_description_enriched": "A bird with brown plumage and large wings is depicted, perched on a branch. The bird has a golden halo around its head, indicating sanctity. The background is a decorative tessellation of gold, blue, and red squares. The bird's beak is open, and its gaze is directed slightly to the right. The overall impression is one of a symbolic representation rather than a naturalistic scene.",
