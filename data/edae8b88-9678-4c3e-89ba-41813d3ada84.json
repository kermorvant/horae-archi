    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman, likely a saint, kneeling and reading from an open book. She is dressed in a blue robe and a red cloak lined with gold. Behind her, an architectural structure with arched openings and what appears to be tracery windows is visible. To her left, two figures stand, one in blue and the other in white, possibly attendants or other saints. To the right, a smaller scene shows a figure kneeling in prayer before a celestial vision, possibly the Virgin Mary and Child, against a green background. The overall setting suggests an interior space with a view into another area or a symbolic representation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely a depiction of a female saint, possibly Mary Magdalene, given the book and her contemplative posture. The smaller scene on the right could represent a vision or a devotional moment, perhaps the Annunciation or a scene from the life of the Virgin Mary, reinforcing the devotional context of a Book of Hours.",
