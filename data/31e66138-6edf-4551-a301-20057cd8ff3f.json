    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, holds the Christ Child, who is also haloed and appears to be blessing. She is seated on the ground, draped in a blue robe. Before her kneels one of the Magi, dressed in a yellow and purple robe, with his hands clasped in prayer. To the left, another Magus, wearing a blue tunic and a green cloak, removes his blue and red turban. The third Magus, wearing a red cloak and a golden turban, presents a golden vessel. Behind them, architectural elements suggest a stable or a ruined structure, with stone walls and arched openings. A man with a beard looks on from the right. Gifts, including a chalice and a covered box, are placed before the Virgin and Child.",
