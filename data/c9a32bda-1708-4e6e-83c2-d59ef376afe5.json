He is being pushed and pulled by several figures, some of whom are soldiers with spears and clubs. To Christ's left, three figures with halos, likely the Virgin Mary and other mourners, are present. Behind the soldiers, a walled city with towers and crenellations is visible. The ground is uneven and covered with green foliage. The overall scene portrays the arduous journey of Christ to his crucifixion.",
