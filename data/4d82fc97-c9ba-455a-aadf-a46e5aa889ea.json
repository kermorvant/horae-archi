    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a humble, wooden structure. The Virgin Mary, seated and draped in a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching out towards a kneeling king. The king, dressed in red and blue, offers a golden casket. Two other kings are present: one in blue and a red crown, holding a golden object, and another in a green tunic and a white crown, looking upwards towards a divine golden light emanating from above. The background suggests a stable with wooden beams and a thatched roof.",
