    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central presentation. On the left, a woman in a white headdress holds a basket. In the center, a woman veiled in dark cloth holds a nude infant. To her right, a bearded man with a dark cap looks down at the infant. Another bearded man, dressed in white and wearing a conical hat, receives the infant, holding a dark cloth. Several other figures are visible in the background, some with head coverings. Above the figures, a decorative crown-like element is suspended. The setting appears to be indoors, with architectural elements suggesting a religious or ceremonial space, possibly indicated by the inscription at the bottom which reads 'ISTE EST QUI TORIV MEV IT'.",
