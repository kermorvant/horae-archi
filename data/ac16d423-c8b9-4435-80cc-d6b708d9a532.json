    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in what appears to be a courtyard or an area adjacent to a building. On the left, the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her blue mantle and halo, is looking towards the right. Beside her, another woman, possibly Elizabeth, also wears a head covering and a blue garment with an orange sash. They are facing an older man with a white beard and a red robe, who is extending his hand towards them. Behind the figures, a classical-style building with arches and columns is visible, suggesting a significant architectural setting. To the left of the figures, a lush green landscape with trees and foliage is depicted, under a blue sky from which golden rays descend, possibly symbolizing divine intervention or blessing. The interaction between the figures and the architectural and natural elements suggests a narrative scene from the Gospels.",
