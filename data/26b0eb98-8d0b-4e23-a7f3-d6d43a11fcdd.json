One man, distinguished by a golden halo, stands facing them, holding a red book and gesturing with his right hand. The background is a deep blue with stylized clouds. The foreground is a green field dotted with yellow, stylized vegetation. The scene appears to be an outdoor setting, possibly a pastoral landscape, with no discernible architectural structures.",
