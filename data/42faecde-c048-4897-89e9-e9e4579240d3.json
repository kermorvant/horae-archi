    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling in prayer on a grassy, hilly landscape, with a body of water and distant hills in the background. Above him, an angel descends from the sky, radiating golden light and holding a branch. In the foreground, another man, wearing a red cap and a tunic with the inscription \"ORGVL\", rides a lion. Scattered on the ground are symbols of royalty: a crown, a scepter, and a pair of tongs. The overall composition suggests a narrative of divine intervention or a saintly figure's triumph over adversity, possibly related to themes of faith, power, or judgment.",
