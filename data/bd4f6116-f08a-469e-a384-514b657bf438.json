The central figure, a child with a halo and radiating light, sits on a red, patterned cushion, holding a globe and a cross. To the left, another child plays a lute, while a third child above plays a similar instrument. A fourth child sits to the right, holding a stringed instrument. A red banner unfurls above them, inscribed with Latin text: \"OMNIS SPVS LAVDET DOMINVM\" (All spirits praise the Lord). The scene evokes a heavenly choir celebrating divine praise.",
