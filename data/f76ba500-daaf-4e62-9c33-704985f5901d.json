    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle adorned with gold, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies swaddled in a manger. Behind her, Saint Joseph also prays. The stable is constructed of rough wooden beams and has a thatched roof. Bundles of hay are visible within the structure, and a hint of landscape with trees can be seen through an opening. The overall impression is one of humble reverence for the birth of Christ.",
