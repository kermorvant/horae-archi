    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bearded male figure wearing a crown of thorns and a halo, suggesting a religious context. He has long, wavy hair and is dressed in a garment adorned with a diamond-shaped emblem on the chest and decorative bands around the neck and shoulders. His arms are raised, palms outward, in a gesture that could signify blessing, supplication, or lamentation. Two eight-pointed stars are positioned on either side of his head, within a circular frame that surrounds him. The overall style is that of a woodcut illustration, with bold lines and minimal detail.",
