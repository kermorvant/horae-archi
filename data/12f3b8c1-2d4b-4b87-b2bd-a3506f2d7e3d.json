    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned figure, likely King David, kneeling in prayer outdoors. He wears a royal mantle over a blue, gold-patterned tunic and gazes upwards. Before him, a harp rests on the ground, accompanied by a small, dark object that might be a plectrum. In the upper part of the image, a divine vision unfolds: a figure, possibly God the Father or Christ, is depicted within a radiant halo surrounded by cherubic faces, holding a small orb. The background features a stylized landscape with rocky outcrops, sparse trees, and distant architectural structures resembling castles or churches with spires. The overall composition is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
