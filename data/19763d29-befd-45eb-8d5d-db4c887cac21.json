    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some with beards and wearing elaborate tunics adorned with gold leaf, are walking towards an older man with a long white beard and a blue cap. The older man stands with his hands clasped in prayer, facing the approaching group. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with a path leading through a grassy area with trees in the background. To the right, a building with an arched doorway and decorative elements is visible. The overall impression is one of reverence and anticipation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a moment of supplication or greeting, possibly related to a biblical narrative or a devotional practice. The older man in prayer could represent a figure of authority or spiritual significance, receiving a group of supplicants or visitors. Without further context, a specific event cannot be definitively identified, but the gestures of prayer and the respectful approach of the group suggest a religious or spiritual encounter.",
