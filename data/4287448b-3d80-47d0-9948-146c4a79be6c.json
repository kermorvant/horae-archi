    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into circular compartments. At the top, Christ, with wounds visible on his hands and side, sits enthroned, his arms raised. He is surrounded by figures, some of whom appear to be angels blowing trumpets. To the right of Christ, a group of figures, some with demonic features, are depicted in a chaotic scene, possibly representing hell or damnation. Below Christ, in the central lower compartment, naked figures are shown emerging from sarcophagi or tombs, some reaching upwards. To the left of this resurrection scene, angels are depicted, some appearing to guide or assist the resurrected. The overall composition suggests a depiction of the Last Judgment, with Christ as the judge, the resurrection of the dead, and the separation of the saved from the damned.",
