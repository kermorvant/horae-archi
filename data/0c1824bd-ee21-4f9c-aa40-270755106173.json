    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a grand, vaulted interior. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with wings outstretched and holding a scroll inscribed with \"Ave Maria\", kneels before the Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary, depicted as pregnant and with hands clasped in prayer, is seated or kneeling beneath a richly decorated canopy bed. Behind her, a young child, possibly John the Baptist, stands with hands clasped. The architecture features ribbed vaults, tall arched windows with tracery, and columns, suggesting a Gothic style interior, possibly a chapel or a noble's chamber.",
