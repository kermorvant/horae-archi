    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting that suggests a domestic interior or a private chapel. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated to the left, reading from an open book placed on a lectern. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a white patterned robe. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, kneeling and robed in white with a red cloak, announces the divine message, holding a scroll with Latin text. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from above through a window, with rays of light directed towards Mary. The background features arched windows revealing a landscape with trees and a balustrade. The architecture includes ornate arches, columns, and decorative elements, creating a sense of refined space.",
