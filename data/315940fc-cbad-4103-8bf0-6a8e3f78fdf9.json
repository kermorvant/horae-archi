    "scene_description_enriched": "A person, likely a cleric or a devout individual, is seated on a blue, gold-patterned cushion, wearing a red robe and a red hat with a veil. They are holding an open book with text and appear to be reading or praying. The background suggests an interior space with a blue, gold-patterned drapery behind the figure and a window with a view of the sky. To the right, architectural elements, including a column and an arch, suggest a more elaborate setting, possibly a loggia or a richly decorated room.",
