    "scene_description_enriched": "A white goat with large, curved horns is depicted in profile, running or leaping across a landscape. Its mouth is open, as if bleating. To the left, a dark, leafy tree stands prominently. In the background, a silhouette of buildings, possibly a city or castle, is visible against a lighter sky. The scene is rendered in a somewhat stylized manner, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The goat, particularly a white goat, can symbolize purity, innocence, or Christ himself, especially in the context of sacrifice. Its presence in a landscape with distant buildings might allude to a biblical narrative or a devotional theme related to the natural world and human civilization.",
