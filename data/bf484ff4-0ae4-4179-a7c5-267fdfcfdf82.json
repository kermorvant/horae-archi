    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, with hands clasped in prayer and a golden halo, kneels before the Christ Child, who lies in a radiant manger. An angel with a conical hat hovers over the child, while another angel with red wings reclines nearby. To the right, an elderly man, likely Saint Joseph, holds a cap in his raised hand and leans on a staff, looking towards the scene. Behind them, a donkey and a red ox are visible. In the background, rolling hills lead to a walled city with towers and spires. Above, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted surrounded by seraphim.",
