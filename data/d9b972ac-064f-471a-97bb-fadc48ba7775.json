    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a brutal act of infanticide, likely the Judgment of Solomon, within an outdoor setting. A man in a blue tunic and hat holds a sword, poised to strike a baby. A woman in a purple garment and headscarf kneels, attempting to protect the child, while a robed figure with a fur-trimmed collar and a red hat stands to the right, observing. To the left, a dismembered infant lies on the ground, its head separated from its body. In the background, a stylized cityscape with spires and towers is visible, set against a blue sky with scattered clouds. The overall composition is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
