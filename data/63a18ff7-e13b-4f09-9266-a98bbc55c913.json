    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial gathering with several angels and cherubic figures amidst clouds. On the left, an angel with golden wings holds a child, both reaching upwards towards a divine light emanating from above. Above them, a band of blue filled with faces of cherubic beings represents the heavenly host. To the right, another angel, this one with pink wings, kneels, while a figure in a red robe holds a child who also reaches upwards. The overall impression is one of ascension or divine reception, possibly depicting souls being welcomed into heaven or a moment of divine revelation.",
