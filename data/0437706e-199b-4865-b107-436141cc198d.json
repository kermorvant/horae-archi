    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ's body, pale and lifeless, is being carefully lowered by two men. One man, wearing a blue tunic and orange hose, supports Christ's legs and torso, while another man, dressed in a red and gold patterned tunic and a distinctive hat, holds Christ's upper body and arm. A wooden cross stands prominently in the background, its horizontal beam extending across the upper portion of the image. To the right of the cross, a sorrowful Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, stands with her hands clasped. Beside her, a woman in a golden robe looks on with concern. On the left, a bearded man in a purple tunic, possibly Joseph of Arimathea or Nicodemus, assists in the removal of Christ's body. The background is a simple landscape with rolling hills and a pale blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting.",
