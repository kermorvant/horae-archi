    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures, identified as saints by their halos, stand before a red, gold-patterned background. The figure on the left, dressed in a red robe, holds a green book and a sword. The figure on the right, in a blue robe, holds an open book. Both figures have beards and appear to be elderly. The scene is rendered in a flat, stylized manner typical of medieval manuscript illumination, with no discernible architectural elements or specific setting beyond the decorative backdrop.",
