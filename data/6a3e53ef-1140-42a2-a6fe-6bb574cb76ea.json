On the left, a woman, identified as the Virgin Mary by her halo and crown, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer and her head bowed. She wears a red-brown mantle over an orange tunic and a green undergarment. On the right, a bearded man, likely Joseph, also with a halo, places a crown on the Virgin Mary's head. He wears a blue mantle over a grey tunic and holds a white, circular object in his lap. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
