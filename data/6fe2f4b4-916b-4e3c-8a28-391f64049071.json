    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures on the left, some with hands clasped in prayer, facing a monstrous, multi-headed beast on the right. One figure in the center wears a conical hat and appears to be praying or pleading. The beast has multiple serpentine necks with heads, and its body is partially obscured. The background is abstract, with swirling lines suggesting clouds or a turbulent sky. This imagery strongly suggests a scene from the Book of Revelation, specifically the depiction of the Dragon or the Beast from the Sea, confronting a group of faithful or perhaps the woman clothed with the sun.",
