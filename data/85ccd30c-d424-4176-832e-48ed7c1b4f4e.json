    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border with intricate black ink illustrations on a parchment background. The border features stylized floral motifs, including a prominent flower with multiple petals and swirling leaves. Interspersed within the foliage are depictions of fantastical creatures and human figures. One section shows a creature resembling a rabbit or hare, with detailed fur texture, positioned above a serpentine or dragon-like creature. Further down, a human figure with a crowned head and a beard is visible, with hands clasped. The overall impression is one of a richly ornamented margin, likely from a medieval manuscript, possibly a Book of Hours, intended to frame a larger illustration or text.",
