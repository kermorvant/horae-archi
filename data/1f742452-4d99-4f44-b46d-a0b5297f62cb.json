    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Luke the Evangelist, identifiable by the ox symbol often associated with him, writing in a book at a wooden desk. He is seated in an interior space with stone walls, a window showing a landscape, and a framed image of the Virgin and Child above him. To the right, a complex architectural structure with red-trimmed windows and decorative elements suggests a church or cathedral interior, possibly a choir or nave with tiered seating. The text below the scene reads 'Secundu Lucam' and 'Illotempore', indicating it is the second book of Luke and 'in that time'.",
