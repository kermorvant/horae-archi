    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. Christ's body, wounded and pale, lies diagonally across the composition, draped in a white shroud. His head is tilted back, and his eyes are closed. To his left, a figure in a red robe, possibly John the Evangelist, supports his head. To his right, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and white veil, gently touches Christ's chest, her face etched with sorrow. In the background, a stylized landscape with rolling hills and a distant, simplified architectural structure suggests an outdoor setting. The overall impression is one of profound grief and devotion.",
