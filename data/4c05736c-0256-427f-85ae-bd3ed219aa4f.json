    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with large red and green wings descends from a blue sky, holding a scroll with golden lettering. Below, three shepherds are depicted in a hilly, green landscape dotted with rocks and trees. Two shepherds stand, one with hands clasped in prayer and the other looking upwards, while the third shepherd kneels. A flock of white sheep grazes around them. In the background, on either side of the scene, are fortified castles with towers and battlements, suggesting a distant settlement.",
