    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around the Virgin Mary, who is kneeling and appears to be in prayer or contemplation. She is dressed in a blue mantle and red undergarment. The other figures, all with golden halos, are also shown with hands clasped in prayer, suggesting a devotional gathering. Behind the figures, architectural elements are visible, including columns supporting an arched structure and windows with diamond-shaped tracery. The overall setting suggests an interior space, possibly a chapel or a room within a religious building.",
