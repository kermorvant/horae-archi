    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket. A man in a red tunic, identified as one of the knights, raises a sword to strike the kneeling bishop, who is wearing a mitre and vestments. Another figure, possibly a woman or another knight, in a blue tunic and pink cloak, restrains the bishop's head. The figures are set against a blue, patterned background within a quatrefoil frame, with a green, grassy ground beneath them. The overall composition suggests a violent act of execution, interpreted as the martyrdom of Thomas Becket.",
