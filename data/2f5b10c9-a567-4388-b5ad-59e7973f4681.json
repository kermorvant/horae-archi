    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identifiable by her halo and crown of thorns, stands in a landscape. She wears a black mantle over a white habit and holds a red heart in her left hand and a purple book in her right. At her feet, a horned demon lies defeated. The background depicts rolling hills and a blue sky, with a low wall and trees in the middle ground. The scene likely represents a saint's triumph over temptation or her devotion to divine love.",
