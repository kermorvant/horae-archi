    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures standing within a richly decorated architectural setting. The figure on the left, with a halo, wears a blue robe and a reddish-brown cloak, gesturing with their right hand. The figure on the right, also with a halo and wearing a crown, is dressed in an orange robe and a greyish-purple cloak, with their hands clasped at their chest. They are positioned within a golden, shimmering background, framed by elaborate golden architectural elements that resemble Gothic tracery and pinnacles. The architectural elements suggest a sacred or royal space, possibly a church or a palace interior, with decorative motifs of trefoils and lancet windows.",
