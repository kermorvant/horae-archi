    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crowning with Thorns. In the foreground, Christ, wearing a red cloak and a crown of thorns, is seated. Two figures are actively placing the thorns upon his head, one with a pink tunic and green hose, the other in a green tunic and purple hat. Another figure in a blue and orange tunic looks up at Christ. In the background, through an arched opening, several figures are visible. One figure, possibly a guard, holds a whip, while another appears to be being struck. Flames are depicted in the upper left background, suggesting a chaotic or violent setting. A figure in a blue hat and green garment looks out from an upper window.",
