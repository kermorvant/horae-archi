    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of women, all wearing crowns, gathered in what appears to be an interior space. On the left, three women are grouped together, with the central figure in a deep red gown holding a dark object. To the right, two women in blue and yellow gowns are interacting, with the woman in blue extending her hands. Behind them, a richly patterned tapestry or wall hanging serves as a backdrop. The overall impression is one of a courtly gathering or a scene of importance among royal or noble women.",
