    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer, facing left. Behind her, two figures, likely Apostles, stand with their hands raised in a gesture of awe or supplication. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The background features a reddish-brown wall with golden leaf motifs and a blue, diamond-patterned window. The figures are positioned on a green, cracked ground. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine inspiration or revelation.",
