    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, richly dressed in a blue tunic and a pink robe trimmed with white fur and gold, sits on a wooden chair near a fireplace. He wears a blue and gold crown and red shoes. His left hand is raised in a gesture of speech or explanation. To his right, a woman in a blue dress and white head covering carries a bundle of firewood. Behind her, a wooden cabinet holds a bowl and a jug. The scene takes place indoors, with a window showing a diamond-patterned grid, suggesting a domestic setting. The presence of a fire and firewood implies a need for warmth and sustenance.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a domestic moment, possibly illustrating a moral or didactic tale, or a scene from daily life that serves as a backdrop for a devotional text. The man's regal attire and gesture might suggest a figure of authority or wisdom, while the woman's task of gathering firewood could represent labor or humility. Without further context, a specific biblical or liturgical interpretation is not possible, but it evokes themes of domesticity, provision, and social roles.",
