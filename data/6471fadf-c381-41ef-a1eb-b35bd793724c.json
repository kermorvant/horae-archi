Both figures have halos, indicating their sanctity. They are shown in a landscape setting with rolling green hills, scattered trees, and a distant view of a fortified town with towers and spires. The figures are positioned within an ornate, gilded architectural frame, suggesting a devotional context. The interaction between Mary and Elizabeth, with their hands touching, signifies their embrace and the recognition of Elizabeth's pregnancy and Mary's divine conception.",
