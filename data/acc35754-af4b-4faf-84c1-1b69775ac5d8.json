    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine figure, likely God the Father, with a long white beard and a crown, seated and draped in a blue robe adorned with gold patterns. He holds a young, nude figure, possibly Christ Child, who is embracing a white dove. The divine figure's right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing. Surrounding the central figures are multiple winged seraphim with red wings and gold accents, arranged in fiery, radiating patterns. Above, a golden halo with inscriptions surrounds a crown, and two winged figures are shown placing the crown. Below, a golden orb with a cross on top is depicted, held by figures in blue robes. The background is a deep blue with radiating gold lines, suggesting a celestial or divine realm.",
