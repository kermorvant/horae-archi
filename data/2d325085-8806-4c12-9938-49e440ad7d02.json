    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures, two on horseback and one on foot, are depicted in a landscape setting. The figures are richly dressed in medieval attire, with one figure on the right riding a brown horse and gesturing with open hands. To the left, another figure rides a white horse, while a third figure stands between them. A bird is shown flying in the upper right corner. The scene is framed by a decorative border and includes a banner with Latin text. The overall impression is one of movement and perhaps a procession or journey.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The image likely depicts a scene from a Book of Hours, possibly illustrating a biblical narrative or a devotional text. The figures' attire and the presence of horses suggest a journey or a significant event. Without further context or clearer iconography, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it could relate to a pilgrimage, a royal procession, or a scene from the life of a saint.",
