    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a hermit or saint, is depicted seated within a simple, thatched shelter. He wears a brown monastic habit and holds a red book. Beside him, a brown animal, possibly a dog or a wild boar, rests. The shelter is constructed with woven material and straw. In the background, a rocky landscape gives way to a distant city with spires and buildings, set against a pale purple sky. The scene evokes a sense of solitude and contemplation, possibly representing a saint in his hermitage.",
