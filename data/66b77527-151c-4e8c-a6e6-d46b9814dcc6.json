They stand before a golden, arched architectural structure with visible windows. In the background, a pastoral landscape unfolds with sheep grazing and a shepherd standing in the distance. Above, an angel descends from a celestial realm, indicated by golden rays and a blue sky, towards a distant castle or fortified city.",
