    "scene_description_enriched": "An elderly man with a long white beard and a red and white patterned hat places his hand on the head of a kneeling man in a blue robe. The kneeling man has his hands clasped in prayer. Behind him, another man in a red robe also has his hands clasped, and a third man in a pinkish robe stands to the side, looking upwards. The scene is set against a vibrant blue sky filled with golden clouds, and the figures stand on a green, grassy ground with small white floral motifs. The elderly man wears a long blue robe with gold trim and a golden cloak. The overall impression is one of blessing or investiture.",
