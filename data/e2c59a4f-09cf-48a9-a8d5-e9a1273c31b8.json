    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, bound and wearing a purple robe and a crown of thorns, being presented to a seated figure in red robes and a red hat. Two figures, one in green and blue, and another in orange, are shown tormenting Christ. The seated figure, likely Pontius Pilate, is depicted with his hands over a golden basin, possibly indicating his washing of hands. The background is a rich gold leaf, typical of illuminated manuscripts, suggesting a divine or significant setting. The floor is a checkered pattern, and a wooden platform is visible.",
