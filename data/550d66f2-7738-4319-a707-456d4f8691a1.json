    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. The Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue robe and halo, is shown with her hands crossed, looking down at an open book on a pink draped table. An angel, with large blue and white wings and a halo, kneels before her, gesturing with one hand and holding a scroll that reads 'Ave. Gratia. Plena. Dominus. tecum.' (Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee). A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, flies above the Virgin. The background is richly decorated with red patterned fabric and architectural elements suggesting a room, with green draperies hanging from above. In an upper niche, a figure, likely God the Father, is depicted with a beard and halo, his hands raised in blessing.",
