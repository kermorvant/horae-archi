    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some with beards and long hair, are gathered around a golden altar. On the altar lies a white animal, possibly a lamb, which is being sacrificed. Blood is depicted flowing from the animal onto the altar and the ground below. The background features a dense, tessellated pattern of red and blue squares, with golden rays emanating from the top, suggesting a divine or celestial presence. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with a hint of green grass at the bottom.",
