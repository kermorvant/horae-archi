    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a crown of thorns and a halo. He has long, wavy hair and a solemn expression. His arms are raised, with palms facing outwards, in a gesture of blessing or supplication. He is adorned with a richly decorated garment, featuring a diamond-shaped emblem on his chest. Two star-like motifs are visible on either side of his head, against a plain background. The style is reminiscent of woodcut illustrations, with bold outlines and hatching for shading.",
