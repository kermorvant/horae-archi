    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identifiable by her halo, is depicted in prayer with her hands clasped and a small cross held above them. She wears a blue gown adorned with gold patterns. To her left, a monstrous, demonic figure with a gaping mouth and sharp teeth is shown, its jaws holding a blue cloth. The background suggests an interior architectural setting with grey walls and what appear to be pilasters or columns. The saint is positioned on the back of a serpentine creature, possibly representing the devil or a demon, which is coiled around her. This scene likely depicts the triumph of faith over evil, a common theme in Christian iconography.",
