    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated on a cushioned throne, holding the Christ Child. The Christ Child is reaching for a golden plate offered by a kneeling figure, possibly an angel or a saint, dressed in white. Behind the Virgin Mary is a pink canopy adorned with stars, and to the left, a lush green background with flowering plants. To the right, a dark blue form, possibly a wing, suggests the presence of an angelic being. The overall setting appears to be a garden or an idealized outdoor space, framed by an arched border.",
