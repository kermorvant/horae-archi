    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a beard, wearing a hat, a pink tunic, and patterned leggings, is depicted in an outdoor setting. He is holding a long yellow stick and a woven basket. He appears to be engaged in some form of harvesting or gathering, possibly from a tree with round, orange fruits and green leaves. Small, dark, spiky figures are scattered around the ground, and a body of water is visible in the lower part of the image. The scene likely represents a month from a calendar cycle, depicting agricultural labor.",
