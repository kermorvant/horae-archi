Behind him, several figures in black habits and blue caps are visible. To the right, another cleric in a white habit holds a processional cross and a basket. In the foreground, a man in a red and gold tunic kneels beside a shrouded body, which is marked with a cross. The scene appears to depict a burial or a funeral rite.",
