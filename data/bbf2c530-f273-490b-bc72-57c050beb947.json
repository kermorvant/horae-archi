Joseph, with a blue hood and red tunic, walks beside the donkey, carrying a basket and a staff. In the background, a rural landscape unfolds with a winding path, a body of water, trees, and a rocky outcrop. Further in the distance, a village with houses and a prominent church with spires is visible. Other figures are present in the background, including a woman with a child, a man with a sword, and a farmer harvesting a field, suggesting the continuation of daily life amidst their sacred journey. A tall column with a statue stands on a hill.",
