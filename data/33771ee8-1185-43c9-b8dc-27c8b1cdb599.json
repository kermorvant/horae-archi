    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with hands clasped in prayer and a halo, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies naked on the ground. A donkey stands over the child, its head bowed. Behind them, Saint Joseph, also with a halo and wearing a hooded robe, looks on. The figures are set against a backdrop of rudimentary architectural elements, including a wall and what appears to be a vaulted ceiling or archway, suggesting an enclosed, humble setting for the birth.",
