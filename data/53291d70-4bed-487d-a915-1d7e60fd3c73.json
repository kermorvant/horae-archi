Two Magi are present: one kneels, offering a chalice, while another, wearing a crown, stands and gestures. Behind them, a stable structure with a thatched roof shelters a cow and a donkey. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible under a blue sky with radiating sunbeams. The overall setting is outdoors, with rolling green hills and foliage.",
