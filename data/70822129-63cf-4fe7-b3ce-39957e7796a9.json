    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a young man in armor, holding a helmet and a bundle of reeds or branches, walking from left to right. He is in an outdoor setting with rolling hills and trees in the background. To the right, a group of three men are observing him. The central figure, an elderly man with a long white beard, wears a blue robe and holds a staff. He is flanked by a man in a yellow robe and red hat, and another man in a red robe and blue hat. The figures are framed by an architectural element that suggests a window or an archway, with decorative tracery at the top.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts David after his victory over Goliath, possibly returning with spoils or being presented to Saul. The young man in armor could represent David, and the older man with the staff might be Saul or a prophet. The bundle of reeds could symbolize the spoils of war or a symbolic offering.",
