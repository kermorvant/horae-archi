    "scene_description_enriched": "In an outdoor setting, three figures are engaged in various activities. In the foreground, a woman kneels, tending to a circular object on the ground, possibly a brazier, with a stick. To her right, a man kneels on a large, scaly creature, appearing to be skinning or preparing it with a long, thin tool. Behind them, another figure stands, holding a stick and gesturing towards the sky where a goat-like creature is depicted within clouds. In the background, several buildings with pitched roofs and windows are visible, suggesting a settlement. The scene likely depicts a pastoral or agricultural activity, possibly related to the zodiac sign Capricorn, given the celestial goat.",
