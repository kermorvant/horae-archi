    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling in prayer outdoors, with his hands clasped and his gaze directed upwards. He is richly robed in a patterned garment with a white mantle. To his right, a harp and a small crown are placed on the ground. In the background, a rocky landscape transitions into rolling hills and a distant city. Above, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is shown in a radiant halo, extending a hand. This imagery suggests a moment of divine revelation or supplication, likely representing David in prayer, as indicated by the presence of the harp and crown, symbols often associated with him.",
