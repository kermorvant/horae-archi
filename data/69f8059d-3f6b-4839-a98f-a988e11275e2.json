In the upper left, a group of armored soldiers on horseback are gathered near a body of water, with some figures submerged or struggling in the water. In the upper right, a procession of figures on horseback and on foot moves through a landscape dotted with trees and leading towards a walled city with prominent towers and spires. In the lower portion of the image, a group of people are gathered around a rocky formation from which water is flowing. One figure in a red robe is directing another figure kneeling to drink from the water source. Other figures are observing or interacting with the scene. The overall setting is a vibrant, detailed landscape with architectural elements in the background.",
