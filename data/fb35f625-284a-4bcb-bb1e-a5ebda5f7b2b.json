    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher wading through a body of water, carrying the Christ Child on his shoulders. Saint Christopher, a large bearded man wearing a blue tunic and a white head covering, leans on a staff for support as he navigates the choppy waters. The Christ Child, depicted as a young boy with a halo, sits on Saint Christopher's shoulders, his right hand raised in blessing. A large red cloak drapes over Saint Christopher's back and shoulders, billowing in the wind. In the background, a city with towers and buildings is visible across the water, and a small boat is moored to the left. The overall impression is one of arduous journey and divine protection.",
