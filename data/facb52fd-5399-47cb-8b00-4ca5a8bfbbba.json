    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, possibly representing a prophet or saint, stands on a grassy incline, his hands clasped in prayer or supplication. He is illuminated by golden rays descending from a blue sky filled with stylized clouds. Before him, a group of women, dressed in medieval attire, look towards him with expressions of awe or concern. Several sheep graze on the green hillside, and a small stone trough, from which water flows into a stream, is depicted in the foreground. The scene evokes a pastoral setting imbued with divine presence.",
