    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a manger radiating a golden halo. To the right, an elderly man, likely Saint Joseph, kneels in adoration, his head bowed. Behind him, a woman in a pink garment also prays. The stable itself is constructed of rough wood with a thatched roof, and an ox and donkey are visible within its enclosure. The background features stylized green hills and trees under a blue sky.",
