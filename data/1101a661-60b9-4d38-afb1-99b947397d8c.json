    "scene_description_enriched": "A kneeling figure, identified as a bishop by his mitre and cope, holds a red heart in his right hand. He is dressed in a blue cope over a red tunic and white alb, and holds a crosier in his left hand. The scene is set in an outdoor landscape with rolling green hills, trees, and a rocky outcrop. A flock of birds flies in the sky. The figure's posture and the heart suggest a devotional context, possibly representing divine love or the offering of one's heart to God. The architectural elements are limited to distant, stylized trees that suggest a landscape setting, and the decorative border of the manuscript itself.",
