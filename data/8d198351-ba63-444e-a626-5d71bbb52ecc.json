    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and wearing a purple robe, stumbling under the weight of the cross. He is being assisted by two figures, one in a blue tunic and the other in a red cloak, who are struggling to lift the heavy wooden beam. Behind them, a crowd of onlookers and soldiers are visible, some carrying sticks and spears. In the background, a fortified city gate with a large arched entrance and towers suggests the setting is outside the city walls, possibly on the road to Golgotha. The overall atmosphere is one of suffering and persecution.",
