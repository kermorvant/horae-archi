    "scene_description_enriched": "A young, haloed figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, is depicted kneeling outdoors, writing on a scroll. To his left, a large eagle, his traditional symbol, holds the end of the scroll in its beak, also appearing to write or dictate. The figure wears a golden tunic and a rose-colored mantle. The background features a rocky outcrop, lush green trees with white blossoms, rolling hills, and a distant, idealized city with towers and spires. Golden rays emanate from the top of the image, suggesting divine inspiration. The scene is framed by an ornate border with floral motifs.",
