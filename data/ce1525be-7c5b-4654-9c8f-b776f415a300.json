    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, holding the Christ Child, is seated. One of the Magi, an elderly man with a long beard, kneels before them, offering a gift. Behind the Virgin, another figure, possibly a donor or attendant, holds a basket. To the right, two other Magi are present, one pointing upwards towards a star, and the other holding a vessel. The background shows a hilly landscape with architectural structures, suggesting a distant town or city. The scene is framed by architectural elements that suggest an interior space opening to the exterior.",
