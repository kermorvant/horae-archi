    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, kneels with clasped hands in adoration of the Christ Child, who lies swaddled in a manger. To the left, Saint Joseph, in a pink robe, also kneels with hands pressed together in prayer. Behind them, several figures, possibly shepherds or attendants, are visible, one holding a golden object. Animals, including a cow and an ox, are present in the background, with haystacks to the right. The architecture is simple, suggesting a humble dwelling or stable, with wooden beams and a thatched roof.",
