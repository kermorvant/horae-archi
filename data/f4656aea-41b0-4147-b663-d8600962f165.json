    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition from the Cross. Christ's body, bleeding from wounds and crowned with thorns, is being lowered from the cross by a man in a red robe and blue cap. To the left, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, looks on with hands clasped in prayer, accompanied by another figure in a blue robe. The background is a simple blue sky with scattered gold stars, suggesting a celestial or symbolic setting rather than a literal landscape.",
