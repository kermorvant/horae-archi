She has long, wavy hair and wears a dark garment. The background is abstract, with some suggestion of rays of light emanating from the upper right. The presence of the wheel and sword are common attributes of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who was martyred by being broken on a wheel and then beheaded.",
