Christ holds a cross in his right hand, which is partially obscured by a green cloth. His left hand is raised, with fingers delicately posed. The background is a vibrant blue with radiating lines of light, suggesting a divine presence. The entire scene is framed by an ornamental border with floral motifs.",
