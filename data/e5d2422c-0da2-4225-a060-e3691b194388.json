    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a prophet or saint, is depicted in profile, wearing a draped robe and a headdress. The figure has a beard and appears to be looking upwards or to the side. The scene is framed by architectural elements that suggest a decorative border or a niche. The overall style is that of a woodcut or engraving, common in medieval manuscripts. The scene's religious significance is suggested by the figure's contemplative pose and the context of a Book of Hours, which typically illustrates biblical or devotional scenes.",
