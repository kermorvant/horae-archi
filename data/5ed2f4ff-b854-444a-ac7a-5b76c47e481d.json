    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely God the Father, adorned with a crown and a beard, gesturing with his right hand. He is seated on a throne draped with golden fabric patterned with red floral motifs. Before him, a woman, presumably the Virgin Mary, stands with her hands clasped in prayer. She is dressed in a blue robe with gold accents. Behind her, several angels are visible, one of whom holds a crown. The background is a vibrant red, filled with stylized representations of angelic faces. The overall setting suggests a divine or celestial realm, indicated by the presence of God, angels, and the lack of earthly architecture.",
