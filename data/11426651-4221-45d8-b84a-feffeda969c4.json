    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned male figure with a long beard and flowing hair is depicted, wearing a regal robe and holding a globus cruciger. He is surrounded by a halo and four eight-pointed stars. The figure's posture and regalia suggest a royal or divine status. The presence of the globus cruciger, a symbol of Christ's dominion over the world, further reinforces a religious interpretation. The overall composition is stylized and symbolic, typical of woodcut illustrations.",
