    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a beard, wearing a long robe, placing a crown on the head of a kneeling woman. The woman is also robed and has her hands clasped in prayer. They are positioned within an architectural setting that appears to be an interior space, possibly a room or a niche, with a textured wall behind them. The scene is framed by decorative elements on the sides, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
