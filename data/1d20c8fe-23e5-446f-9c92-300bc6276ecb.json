    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts two figures flanking a central text block. On the left, an elderly man with a long beard, wearing a cap and ornate clothing, points with his right hand towards the text. He holds a small circular object in his left hand. On the right, a figure, possibly a woman, also wearing a cap and draped robes, looks upwards and gestures with both hands. The figures are framed by decorative elements resembling stylized foliage or grapes. The central text is divided into two sections by a horizontal band of brickwork. The upper text reads 'in frōte fua aut imanu fua: hic' and the lower text reads 'bibei debino tre dei. 7c. ap. p. xiiii.'. The overall style suggests a woodcut illustration from a printed book, likely a Book of Hours or a similar devotional text, with the figures possibly representing prophets or biblical characters associated with the accompanying scripture.",
