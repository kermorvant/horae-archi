    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king, adorned with a crown and a golden robe, pointing with his right hand. Beside him stands another figure in a red tunic. In the foreground, a woman in a blue dress kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, her head bowed. Behind her, a man in a light-colored tunic raises a large tool, possibly a shovel or a hammer, as if to strike her. The background shows a hilly landscape with scattered buildings and trees under a blue sky with clouds. The overall scene suggests an act of judgment or execution, possibly related to a biblical or hagiographic narrative.",
