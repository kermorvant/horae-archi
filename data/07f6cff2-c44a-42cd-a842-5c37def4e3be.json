The Virgin Mary, in a blue gown, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies on a patterned blue cloth on the ground. To the left, an elderly man with a white beard, dressed in a brown and orange robe, holds a lit candle and also appears to be in prayer. Behind them, a cow and a donkey are visible. Above, an angel with folded hands hovers, and in the background, a walled city with towers and spires is depicted. The architectural elements include a wooden stable structure with a visible roof and a dormer window, and in the distance, elements of civic architecture.",
