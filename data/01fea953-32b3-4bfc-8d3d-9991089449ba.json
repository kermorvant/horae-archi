    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo, kneeling and writing on a scroll or tablet with his finger. He is surrounded by three figures. To his right stands a woman with her hands clasped, wearing a headdress. Behind Christ and to his left are two men, one with a turban-like head covering and a beard, and another behind him also wearing a similar head covering. The figures are framed by an architectural element that suggests an archway with decorative foliage. The overall style is that of a woodcut illustration, likely from a printed book.",
