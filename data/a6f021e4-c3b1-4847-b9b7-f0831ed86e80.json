    "scene_description_enriched": "The upper scene depicts a young shepherd boy, barefoot and holding a staff, with a dog at his side. He is dressed in a white tunic with blue and red trim. The background is a landscape with hills. The lower scene shows two figures. The foreground figure, dressed in pink and green, carries a lamb. Behind them, another figure, wearing a blue tunic and a hat, looks on. Both figures are framed by architectural elements. Above the upper scene is a coat of arms with fleur-de-lis. Above the lower scene is another coat of arms, this time a red shield on a white horseshoe-like shape. The overall framing suggests a decorative border within a manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The upper scene likely represents a shepherd, possibly alluding to the shepherds who visited the infant Jesus, or a general pastoral theme. The lower scene, with one figure carrying a lamb and another looking on, could be interpreted as a representation of the Visitation, or more generally, a scene of care and protection, perhaps alluding to Christ as the Good Shepherd or the carrying of a sacrificial lamb.",
