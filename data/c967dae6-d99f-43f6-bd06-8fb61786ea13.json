    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe and with a golden halo, kneels on the left, holding a spindle and looking towards the right. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends towards her. Facing her is the Angel Gabriel, clad in a pink robe with golden wings, extending a hand towards Mary and holding a staff. Behind Mary is a red tapestry with gold ornamentation. In the background, architectural elements suggest an interior space, including columns, arches, and a vaulted ceiling. A small lectern with a book rests near Mary. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
