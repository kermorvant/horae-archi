    "scene_description_enriched": "A large, gilded letter 'I' is prominently displayed, surrounded by a decorative vine bearing green leaves and clusters of purple grapes. The vine branches out from the base of the letter and extends across the white background, creating an organic and ornamental frame. The overall composition is simple yet elegant, typical of illuminated manuscript initials.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The vine and grapes are common Christian symbols. The vine can represent Christ himself (John 15:1-5), and the grapes, particularly when associated with the vine, can symbolize the Eucharist, representing Christ's blood shed for humanity. The letter 'I' itself is likely the initial of a liturgical text, such as a psalm or prayer.",
