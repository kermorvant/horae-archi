    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child. Mary is seated, wearing a blue mantle over a white garment, and has a golden halo. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is held in her arms. To the right, a large, pink wing, presumably belonging to an angel, is visible. The figures are set against a background of gold leaf with a patterned grid of blue and gold squares. The foreground shows a green landscape with small white and orange flowers. The entire scene is framed by decorative elements, including a dark blue border with white foliate motifs and a twisted, dark red and blue band on the left, against a gold background.",
