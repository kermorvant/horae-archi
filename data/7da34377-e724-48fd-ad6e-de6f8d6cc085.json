    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in an outdoor setting, engaged in the act of butchering a wild boar. The figure on the left, wearing a blue head covering and an orange tunic over a white apron, is holding the boar's hindquarters and appears to be making a cut, as indicated by the blood. The figure on the right, dressed in a blue tunic, is holding the boar's front legs. The background shows a green landscape with trees and distant hills, and several small, dark figures in the distance, possibly other hunters or animals. The entire scene is framed within an architectural arch, suggesting it is a miniature within a larger manuscript.",
