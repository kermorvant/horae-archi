    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central figure, likely the Virgin Mary, who is veiled and has her hands raised in prayer or supplication. She is surrounded by several other individuals, some of whom also have their hands raised. Above them, in the upper part of the circular frame, are what appear to be divine hands descending from a cloud-like formation. The setting is somewhat ambiguous, with a suggestion of a rocky or hilly landscape behind the figures, and a decorative border framing the entire composition. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene, possibly depicting a moment of divine intervention or intercession.",
