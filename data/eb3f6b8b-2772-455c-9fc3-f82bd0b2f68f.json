    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, holding a cross. To the left, a monstrous, lion-like creature with a gaping mouth and tufted ears is depicted, seemingly subdued or bound. To the right, a serpentine tail emerges from behind the figure. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element above, suggesting a niche or a decorative canopy. The background is filled with stippling, creating a textured effect. The presence of the monstrous creature and the saint's prayerful posture suggest a scene of triumph over evil or temptation, possibly representing a saint known for overcoming demonic forces.",
