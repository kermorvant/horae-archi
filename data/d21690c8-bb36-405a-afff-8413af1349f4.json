    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a gathering of several figures, predominantly male, set against a richly decorated, reddish-brown background with gold ornamentation. In the foreground, a figure identified as John the Baptist, with a beard and wearing a pink mantle over a yellow tunic, holds a lamb and gestures with his hand. To his right, a figure in green and gold attire, wearing a crown, holds a scepter. To the left of John the Baptist, a figure in blue robes and a white and red mitre holds a staff. Another figure in blue robes, with a beard and holding a book, stands to the right of the crowned figure. Several other figures, some with halos, are visible behind the main individuals. The ground is depicted as green with stylized foliage. The overall impression is of a religious gathering or council of saints.",
