    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her halo and pregnant belly, standing and being greeted by Elizabeth, who is kneeling. Elizabeth, also with a halo, gestures towards Mary with an open hand. Behind Mary stand two figures, possibly attendants or companions, one in white and the other in darker attire. To the right, a building with a distinctive turret and a steeply pitched roof is visible, suggesting a domestic or possibly religious setting. The background shows a stylized landscape with trees and distant structures. The overall composition is framed by decorative elements at the top.",
