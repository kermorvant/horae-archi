    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man with a grey beard, dressed in a blue tunic and a red robe, sits on a wooden bench and writes in a book. To his right, a winged ox with horns rests on a green patterned floor. Behind the man, a blue curtain with gold patterns is visible, and to the right, a patterned red textile hangs. Above the red textile, a window with diamond-shaped panes is depicted. The scene is likely an illustration of Saint Luke, as he is traditionally depicted with his symbol, the winged ox, and is shown writing his Gospel.",
