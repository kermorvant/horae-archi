    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king kneels in prayer, his hands clasped before him, looking upwards. He wears a golden robe lined with ermine and a blue undergarment. Behind him stand three men, one in a blue tunic and red hat, holding a staff. In the sky, an angel with red wings and a red robe descends, holding a sword aloft. The background depicts a lush, green landscape with rolling hills, trees, and distant castles. The scene likely represents a moment of divine intervention or a plea for guidance, possibly related to a biblical narrative or a king's personal devotion.",
