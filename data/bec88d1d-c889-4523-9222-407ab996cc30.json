    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, a man with a beard and a wide-brimmed hat stands to the left, holding a staff and gesturing with his right hand. He is draped in a long robe. To the right, a woman with long, flowing hair kneels, reaching towards a tree. The background is filled with a stippled texture, suggesting foliage or a dense, textured environment. The scene appears to depict a biblical narrative, possibly Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, with the man representing Adam and the woman Eve, and the tree being the Tree of Knowledge.",
