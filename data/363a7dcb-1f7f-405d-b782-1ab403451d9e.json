    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women, likely representing the Virgin Mary and Saint Elizabeth, seated in an interior space with architectural elements. The woman on the left, dressed in a golden robe, is looking down at an open book on a lectern, with her hands clasped. The woman on the right, wearing a blue mantle over a golden tunic, has her hands raised in a gesture of prayer or supplication. Above them, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The background features classical columns and arches, suggesting a sophisticated architectural setting, possibly a church or a grand hall. The overall atmosphere is one of devotion and spiritual significance.",
