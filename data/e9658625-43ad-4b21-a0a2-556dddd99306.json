    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross, his body showing wounds and blood. He wears a crown of thorns. Below the cross, on the left, stands a woman in a white veil and habit, with her hands clasped in prayer. On the right, a man, also with hands clasped in prayer, looks upwards. The background is a decorative pattern of gold motifs on a brown ground, suggesting a stylized, non-realistic setting.",
