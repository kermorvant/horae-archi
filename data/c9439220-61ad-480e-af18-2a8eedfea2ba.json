    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with green wings and a golden robe, kneels and points towards the Virgin Mary. Above him, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove, radiating light. On the right, the Virgin Mary, clad in a pink dress and a blue mantle, is seated with her hands clasped in prayer over an open book. The setting appears to be an interior space with architectural elements suggesting a religious building, possibly a chapel or a church, indicated by the arched doorway and decorative wall panels.",
