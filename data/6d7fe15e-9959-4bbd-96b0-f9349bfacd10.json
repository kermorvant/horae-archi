    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts Saint Andrew, identifiable by the inscription on his garment and the saltire cross he carries. He is shown in an outdoor setting, with a rocky outcrop behind him and a distant blue mountain range under a pale sky. He wears a white tunic, a richly decorated golden stole with red trim, and a vibrant blue mantle. In his left hand, he holds an open book. The scene is framed by a decorative border on the left, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
