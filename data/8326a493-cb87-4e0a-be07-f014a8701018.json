    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in an outdoor setting. On the left, a woman in a blue robe and white veil, with a halo, bows her head and touches her forehead, appearing distressed. On the right, another figure, possibly male, in a red cloak over a blue garment, also bows their head and touches their mouth, with an expression of sorrow or contemplation. The background features a path, a grassy area with a fence, trees, and a distant cityscape under a sky with birds. This scene likely represents the Visitation, where Mary, pregnant with Christ, visits her cousin Elizabeth, who is also pregnant.",
