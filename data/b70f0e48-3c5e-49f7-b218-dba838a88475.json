    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, cloaked in a vibrant blue mantle adorned with gold trim, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child. The Child, with a halo, is held close by Mary, who wears a golden headdress. Leading the donkey is Saint Joseph, dressed in an orange tunic and a purple cloak, with a blue cap and a long white beard. He holds the donkey's rope and a staff. The figures are set against a landscape with rolling hills, sparse vegetation, and a single tree. Above, a blue sky is dotted with stars, and golden rays emanate from a celestial source, suggesting divine presence. The overall impression is one of humble travel under divine guidance.",
