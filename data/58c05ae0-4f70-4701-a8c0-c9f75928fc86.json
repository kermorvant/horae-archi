    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary tenderly holding the Christ Child. Mary, dressed in a vibrant blue mantle with gold trim and a pink undergarment, cradles the infant, who is swaddled in white. Both figures have golden halos, indicating their divine status. They are set against a richly patterned background of interlocking red and blue squares with gold accents, reminiscent of textile or mosaic work. The lower portion of the image shows a green ground, suggesting an outdoor setting, though the background pattern dominates the visual field.",
