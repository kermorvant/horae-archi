An angel, with feathered wings and a halo, kneels before the Virgin, reaching up towards her. Behind Saint Elizabeth stands an elderly man with a long white beard, also looking towards the Virgin. Above them, a group of angels with halos are depicted in a celestial setting against a starry blue background, with golden rays emanating downwards. The figures are set in an outdoor landscape with a green ground and a stylized tree on the left. The lower part of the image contains a decorative border with text and an illuminated initial.",
