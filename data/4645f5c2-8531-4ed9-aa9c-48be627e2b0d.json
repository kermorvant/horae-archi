    "scene_description_enriched": "A divine figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted within a radiant orange halo and a blue crescent moon-like structure. This figure holds a white cloth hammock suspended between their hands, cradling two infants. The infants, each with a golden halo, are depicted with hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a dark, patterned curtain or tapestry is visible, with vertical stripes of black, gold, and brown. The lower portion of the image shows a landscape with sparse vegetation and what appears to be water or mist. Two stylized trees or plants with dark, umbrella-like tops emerge from behind the patterned curtain.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the divine protection and care of infants, possibly alluding to the souls of the departed being held in God's embrace, or a representation of divine providence over children. The infants with halos suggest they are considered holy or blessed.",
