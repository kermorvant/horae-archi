    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Betrayal of Christ, with Jesus at the center being embraced and apprehended by Judas Iscariot, who is identifiable by his kiss. Jesus, with a halo, looks resigned. He is surrounded by a group of soldiers, some of whom are holding spears and clubs. One soldier is grasping Jesus's arm, while another appears to be restraining him. The figures are depicted in a stylized manner, with flowing robes and expressive faces. In the background, there are architectural elements that suggest a city or a building, including what appears to be a tower or a fortified structure with pointed elements, and a torch held aloft. The overall composition is dynamic, conveying the drama and violence of the moment.",
