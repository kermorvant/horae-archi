    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a saint or evangelist, is depicted in profile, looking towards the left. He wears a blue tunic, a pink mantle draped over his shoulders, and orange sleeves. He holds a quill in his right hand, poised over a scroll of parchment that unfurls across his lap. To his left, an angelic figure with feathered wings, rendered in vibrant colors, looks towards the man. The angel holds a book or tablet with musical notation. Both figures are set against a dark, undefined background, suggesting a spiritual or contemplative setting. The man has a halo, indicating his sanctity.",
