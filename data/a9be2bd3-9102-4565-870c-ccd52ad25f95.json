    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a stone altar. A woman in a blue robe kneels, presenting a swaddled infant to a bearded man wearing a red mitre and blue robes, who appears to be a bishop. Behind the bishop, another man in green and blue robes stands. To the left, a woman in a red dress and green apron holds a basket. The background features tall, narrow windows with a diamond-patterned tracery, suggesting an interior architectural setting. The overall scene likely represents a presentation or a religious ceremony involving the infant.",
