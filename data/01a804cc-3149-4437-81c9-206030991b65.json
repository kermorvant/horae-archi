    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, who is shown ascending into heaven, crowned and with hands clasped in prayer, surrounded by a golden halo and a fiery mandorla. Below her, a small angel with green wings holds a rosary. A group of male figures, likely apostles, gaze upwards in awe. One figure on the right, possibly Saint Peter, holds keys and a book, while another to his left holds a book. The figures are set against a blue sky with scattered gold stars, and the ground below is depicted as a golden mound. The scene is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs and gold leaf.",
