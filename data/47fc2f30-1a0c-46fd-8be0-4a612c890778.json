    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel, clad in golden armor and a crimson cloak, standing over a defeated red demon. He holds a sword in his right hand, poised to strike, and a blue shield emblazoned with gold fleurs-de-lis in his left. Behind him, a body of water is visible with several boats, suggesting a coastal or maritime setting. The scene is framed by ornate golden architectural elements, including columns and what appear to be decorative arches, suggesting it is an illuminated manuscript illustration.",
