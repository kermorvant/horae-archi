    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure lying on a raised surface, possibly a bier or bed, with a halo indicating sanctity. This figure appears to be a young person, possibly a child or adolescent, with wounds visible on their torso. To the right, another figure, dressed in a tunic and striped hose, leans over the first figure, seemingly attending to them or observing them. To the left, a third figure, wearing a cap and draped in a cloak, is partially visible, leaning over a barrier and looking towards the central scene. The background suggests an outdoor setting with a stylized landscape featuring trees and hills. The overall impression is one of sorrow or reverence surrounding the deceased or injured individual.",
