    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine council or Trinity. Two figures, likely representing God the Father and God the Son, are seated. The figure on the left, with a beard and long hair, points to an open book held between them. The figure on the right, also bearded, holds a globe. Above them, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from a golden halo. Two winged figures, possibly angels, are positioned in the upper corners, looking towards the central figures. The setting appears to be a celestial or metaphysical realm, indicated by the golden background and the absence of earthly architecture.",
