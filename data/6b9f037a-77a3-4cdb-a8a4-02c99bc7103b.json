    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in prayer, with his hands clasped and raised, looking upwards. Above him, two figures are shown, one kneeling and reaching out, the other reclining. They appear to be in a celestial or elevated space, possibly indicated by the arching structure above them. In the background, a cityscape with various buildings, including towers and walled structures, is visible. The overall composition suggests a devotional scene, possibly representing a prayer being answered or a divine visitation.",
