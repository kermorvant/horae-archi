    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus centrally positioned on the cross, his body emaciated and draped in a loincloth. To his left and right are two other figures also on crosses, appearing to be the two thieves. The figure on Christ's left is depicted with a more skeletal physique, while the figure on Christ's right shows a rounded belly. Behind them, three onlookers are visible: one in a red garment and two in green and dark garments, their faces turned towards the central event. The background is a shimmering gold leaf, suggesting a divine or celestial setting, with a dark ground beneath the figures. The crosses are rendered in blue, and the figures are painted with pale skin tones, emphasizing their suffering.",
