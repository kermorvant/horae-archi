    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a hooded robe and a distinctive hat with a hanging tassel. He is shown in profile, with his right arm raised and index finger pointing upwards, as if in discourse or making a pronouncement. The style is that of a woodcut or engraving, with strong outlines and hatching for shading. No architectural elements or specific setting are visible, suggesting a focus solely on the figure.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The gesture of pointing upwards is often associated with teaching, preaching, or divine inspiration. Without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific biblical or devotional scene. However, the figure's attire and gesture could represent a prophet, a saint, or a learned individual engaged in theological discourse.",
