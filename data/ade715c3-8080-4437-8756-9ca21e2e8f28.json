    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, dressed in a royal blue robe with gold embellishments and a red cloak, kneels in prayer. His hands are clasped, and his gaze is directed upwards towards a celestial vision. Before him lies a golden harp. In the background, a complex cityscape unfolds, featuring a tall, multi-tiered tower with arched windows and decorative sculptures, alongside other buildings with pitched roofs and crenellated battlements. To the right, a circular medallion depicts Christ holding a cross and orb, radiating light. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded archway with carved reliefs.",
