    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint John the Baptist by his halo and devotional posture, is depicted in a green tunic and blue mantle. He holds a quill in his right hand, poised as if to write, and looks down towards an open book. Below him, a young boy with long, light brown hair, likely a disciple or follower, gazes upwards at the saint with clasped hands in prayer or supplication. The background is a vibrant red, suggesting a divine or spiritual setting. The scene is framed by a golden border.",
