    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. A bearded king, seated on a throne and wearing a crown, points towards the Virgin Mary who kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Two winged angels stand behind the Virgin, one placing a crown on her head while the other holds it. The figures are richly robed, with the Virgin in a blue mantle over a gold dress, and the king in red and green robes. The background is a golden expanse with scattered star-like motifs, suggesting a divine setting. Architectural elements, including ornate columns and arches, frame the scene, rendered in gold and vibrant colors.",
