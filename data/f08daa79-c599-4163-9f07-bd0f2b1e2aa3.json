    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a gathering of several individuals around a table, engaged in what appears to be a meal or a social event. One figure is seated, with another kneeling before them, possibly offering something or attending to them. Other figures stand behind the table, some holding objects and conversing. The setting is suggested to be indoors, with a hint of architectural elements in the background, including what might be shelves with vessels. The overall impression is one of a domestic or communal gathering.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is likely a depiction of a biblical or devotional event, possibly related to hospitality or a meal shared by significant figures. Without further context or clearer iconography, a specific interpretation is difficult. However, the presence of multiple figures in a communal setting suggests themes of fellowship, charity, or a specific narrative moment.",
