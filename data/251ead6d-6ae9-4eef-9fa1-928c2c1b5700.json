    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with blue wings and a pink robe, kneels and presents a scroll with text to the Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe and with a halo, is seated on the right, her hand raised in a gesture of acceptance or surprise, and her gaze directed downwards towards an open book on a table. The setting features a checkered floor and green drapery, suggesting an indoor domestic or devotional space. The gold background and decorative border indicate the manuscript's precious nature.",
