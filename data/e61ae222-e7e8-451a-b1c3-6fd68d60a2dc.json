    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely Christ, is depicted in a blue robe adorned with gold patterns. The figure is bending over a white, circular object, possibly a stone or a loaf of bread, and appears to be interacting with it using a tool or instrument. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of red, blue, and gold squares, with a stylized wave-like motif in blue and gold. The foreground is a patch of green grass. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely an illustration of Christ performing a miracle, possibly the multiplication of loaves or the temptation of Christ in the desert where he is tempted to turn stones into bread. Given the circular object and the tool, it could also represent Christ's work as a carpenter or craftsman.",
