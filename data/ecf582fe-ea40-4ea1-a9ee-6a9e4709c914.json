Saint Joseph, dressed in an orange robe and blue tunic, walks alongside, leading the donkey by its reins and holding a staff. They are traveling through a landscape with rolling green hills and stylized trees. Above them, a golden background suggests a divine presence, with rays of light emanating from a stylized sun or celestial source. The border of the illumination features decorative floral motifs.",
