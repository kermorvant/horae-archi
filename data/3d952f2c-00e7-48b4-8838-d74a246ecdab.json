    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a rocky, outdoor landscape with a river and distant castles. In the foreground, a man in ornate golden armor, bleeding from a wound on his forehead, leans against a rock. He holds a mace. Behind him, a second figure, dressed in blue, appears to be throwing stones or small objects at the armored man. The background features rolling hills, a winding river, and a stylized depiction of castles on a distant horizon. The overall impression is one of conflict or an attack in a natural setting.",
