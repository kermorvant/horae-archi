    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ, with a crown of thorns, is being lowered from a wooden beam by several figures. One man in an orange tunic holds a hammer and rope, assisting in the descent. Another man in a red tunic kneels and supports Christ's legs. A crowd of onlookers, some on horseback, are gathered around, observing the event. In the background, a fortified city with towers and a spire is visible, along with a ladder leaning against a wooden structure, possibly a remnant of the crucifixion. The scene is framed by an ornate golden archway, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
