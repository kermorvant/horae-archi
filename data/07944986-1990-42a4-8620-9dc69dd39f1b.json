She is dressed in a blue undergarment and a richly textured golden-orange mantle, with her hands clasped in prayer. Below her, a distant cityscape with spires and buildings is visible, set against a backdrop of rolling green hills and fields. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, gilded archway.",
