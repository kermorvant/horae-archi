    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child is naked and has a halo. Three Magi, identified by their crowns and regal attire, approach to offer gifts. The first Magus, with a long white beard, kneels and presents a golden chalice filled with coins. The second Magus, also bearded and wearing a pink and green robe, stands and holds a golden vessel. The third Magus, younger and wearing a green cloak over a blue tunic, stands and holds a similar golden vessel. Behind them, a rudimentary architectural structure with wooden beams and a red patterned cloth is visible, suggesting a stable or shelter. In the background, a stylized cityscape with towers and buildings under a blue sky with a single star is depicted. The scene is framed by ornate golden architectural elements.",
