    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in conversation, set against a backdrop of stylized buildings. The figure on the left wears a tall, elaborate hat and a robe, with a pendant around their neck. Their hands are clasped. The figure on the right has a beard, wears a patterned garment, and also has their hands clasped in front of them. The architectural elements suggest an urban or ecclesiastical setting. The interaction between the two figures, their gestures, and attire, along with the architectural context, hints at a religious or historical narrative, possibly involving a dialogue or a significant exchange.",
