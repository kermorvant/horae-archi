    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling in prayer, looking upwards. He is dressed in a dark cloak with a fur-lined collar and wears a crown, suggesting he is a king or a nobleman of high status. He is positioned in an interior space, with a patterned tapestry behind him and a harp-like musical instrument to his left. Through an arched opening, two figures are visible: a child with a halo, possibly Christ Child, and an angel, both appearing to descend from a heavenly realm. The architectural framing of the scene, with its decorative arches and columns, suggests a refined interior setting, possibly a private chapel or a chamber within a palace.",
