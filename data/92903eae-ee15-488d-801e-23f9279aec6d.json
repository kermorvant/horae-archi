    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his head bowed and a crown of thorns on his head. Blood drips from his wounds. To the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, stands with her hands clasped in prayer and a sorrowful expression. To the right, Saint John the Evangelist, in a red cloak over a blue robe, holds a book and rests his head on his hand, also appearing distressed. The background is a blue sky with golden rays emanating from above and scattered stars. The figures are set against a naturalistic landscape with trees and hills. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs and gold leaf.",
