    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a lectern with an open book. In the foreground, a woman in a veil clasps her hands in prayer, while another figure kneels before the lectern, also in prayer. Behind them, several other figures, predominantly men with beards, look upwards with hands clasped. Above them, a dove descends, radiating light, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The figures are framed by an architectural structure with decorative arches and columns, suggesting a sacred or important setting. This scene is interpreted as the Descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and the Virgin Mary, a pivotal event in Christian theology.",
