    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is reclining on a red bed, looking towards the viewer. She is dressed in a blue robe and is holding swaddling clothes. To her right, a bearded man, likely Joseph, is also present, wearing a blue robe and reaching towards the swaddling clothes. Behind them, a manger is visible, containing the Christ Child, who also has a halo. A bull and a donkey are positioned behind the manger, their heads bowed. Above the figures, rays of light emanate from a blue cloud, suggesting divine intervention. The background is a decorative green pattern with gold swirls.",
