    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ in a frontal pose, with a halo and wounds on his chest and feet, standing on a golden orb. He is surrounded by a decorative, patterned background and two blue winged figures, possibly angels or demons, holding trumpets. Below Christ, a green landscape is populated by several figures emerging from the ground, some appearing to be in prayer or distress. To the right, a monstrous, open-mouthed creature with sharp teeth is depicted. The overall scene suggests a representation of the Last Judgment or Christ's triumph over hell.",
