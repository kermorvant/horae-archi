    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Entombment of Christ. Christ's body, pale and marked with wounds, lies on a stone sarcophagus, draped in a white loincloth. A crown of thorns encircles his head. Around the sarcophagus, several figures with halos mourn his death. To the left, a man in blue and green gazes down, while another in orange and blue looks on. In the center, a woman in blue, likely the Virgin Mary, is overcome with grief, her head bowed. Beside her, another figure in pink holds a vessel, possibly for anointing. To the right, a man in red and blue with a beard looks towards Christ. The background is a decorative tapestry of gold and blue diamonds. The scene is framed by a decorative border with floral motifs.",
