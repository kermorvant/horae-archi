    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by several Roman soldiers. Christ, wearing a simple robe and with a halo, bears the weight of a large golden cross on his shoulder. His face shows signs of suffering. The soldiers, clad in armor and helmets, surround him, some holding ropes that appear to bind him. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling hills and a cloudy sky. The overall impression is one of solemnity and the grim progression towards crucifixion.",
