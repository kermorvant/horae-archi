    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity seated on a throne. God the Father, on the right, is crowned and bearded, wearing a blue robe and a pink mantle. He is pointing to an open book. Jesus Christ, on the left, is depicted with a halo and a beard, wearing a blue robe and a pink mantle, holding a cross. The Holy Spirit is represented as a dove with a halo, positioned between God the Father and Jesus. Behind them, a fiery halo composed of red flames and angelic faces emanates, suggesting a divine presence. The figures are seated on a tiered structure with a checkered floor. The architectural elements are minimal, suggesting a symbolic rather than literal setting.",
