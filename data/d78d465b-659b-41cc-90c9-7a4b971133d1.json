    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely a saint, stands in a landscape. He has a long grey beard and hair, and wears a dark blue monastic habit with gold trim and a red cowl. He holds a staff in his left hand and a red book in his right. At his feet, a boar's head emerges from flames, suggesting a connection to the legend of Saint Anthony Abbot. To the right, a grey stone structure with a dark arched opening and a golden emblem is visible. The background depicts stylized blue mountains and a pale sky with some clouds. The overall scene is rendered with vibrant colors and gold leaf, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
