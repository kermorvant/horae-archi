    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, with the Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue and holding the Christ Child, riding a donkey. Beside them walks a bearded man, likely Saint Joseph, dressed in a red robe and leaning on a staff. In the background, a complex of buildings with pitched roofs and a tower with a blue dome suggests a town or settlement. The landscape is rendered with rolling hills and trees, under a pale blue sky with faint indications of birds or clouds.",
