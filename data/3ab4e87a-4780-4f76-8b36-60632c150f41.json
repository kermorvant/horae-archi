    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with a halo, dressed in a blue tunic and a brown mantle, kneels on the ground, writing on a scroll. She has long, blonde hair and is looking down at her work. To her right, a golden eagle with outstretched wings holds a small object in its beak. The background depicts a rocky landscape with trees and a body of water, suggesting an outdoor setting. The presence of the halo and the eagle, a traditional attribute of Saint John the Evangelist, indicates a religious scene.",
