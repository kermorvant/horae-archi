    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures carries a rectangular object, possibly a coffin or reliquary, under a decorative arch. The figures are depicted in profile and three-quarter view, with some wearing armor and others in draped garments. The scene is framed by an ornamental border, suggesting it is part of a larger narrative or devotional work. The overall impression is one of solemnity and movement, possibly depicting a funeral or the transport of sacred relics.",
