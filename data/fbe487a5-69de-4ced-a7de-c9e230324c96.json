    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a group of people enjoying a picnic on a grassy bank by a body of water. In the foreground, several couples are seated on the ground, with food and drink laid out on a cloth. A man in a red jacket and black hat is embracing a woman in a black dress. To the left, a boy in a purple tunic is arranging bottles and baskets. In the background, a river or lake is visible, with boats on the water. On the far left, a ruined castle or fortified building complex stands amidst trees. Above the scene, two putti (cherubs) are flying; one aims a bow and arrow, while the other scatters flowers. The overall atmosphere is one of leisure and romantic dalliance, possibly allegorical given the presence of the putti.",
