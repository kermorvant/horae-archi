    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a dramatic moment where a figure, identified as Christ, is being apprehended. He is surrounded by a crowd of men, some of whom are soldiers in armor and helmets, holding spears. One man, wearing a blue tunic and armor, is kneeling and appears to be striking Christ's head, causing blood to flow. Another figure in a red cloak is reaching out, possibly to restrain Christ or to strike him. Christ himself has a sorrowful expression, with his head slightly bowed. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a hint of architectural structure on the right, possibly a wooden beam or part of a building, and a ground with sparse vegetation. The overall atmosphere is one of violence and betrayal.",
