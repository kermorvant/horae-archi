    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession of three skeletal figures, each wearing a crown, advancing from the left. They are draped in white garments and appear to be interacting with a group of living individuals. In the center, a white horse is mounted by a young man in a blue tunic and a red cap, his legs covered by a richly patterned yellow and blue cloth. To his right, another young man in a red and green outfit, also wearing a cap, gestures towards the skeletal figures. The background features a walled enclosure, a distant castle on a hill, and a blue sky. A crucifix stands prominently to the left of the horse. The overall composition suggests a confrontation or interaction between the living and the dead, possibly representing the Dance of Death or a similar memento mori theme.",
