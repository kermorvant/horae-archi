    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, is seated and reading from a scroll. The figure wears a blue robe over a brown garment and a brown cap. To the left of the figure, a small, dark, ape-like creature with green eyes sits on a green patterned ground. Behind the figure is a grey wall with vertical and horizontal lines, suggesting a structured interior space. The scene is framed by an arched opening with decorative elements above.",
