Christ's body is shown wounded and wrapped in a white shroud. Several figures surround them, including a man in a red robe supporting Christ's legs, another man in blue holding his upper body, and two other women in the background. Behind them, a ladder leans against a wooden cross, and a scroll with Latin text is visible at the top. The setting is an outdoor landscape with green hills and scattered trees.",
