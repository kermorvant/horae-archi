    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman, likely Bathsheba, bathing in a stone basin filled with water. She is nude with long blonde hair. Two women stand beside her, one holding a mirror. In the background, a man in ornate robes converses with a young boy, while other figures observe from windows and balconies of a castle-like structure. The overall setting is a courtyard with architectural elements suggesting a domestic or royal residence, with a prominent tower in the distance. The presence of the mirror and the bathing ritual suggests a narrative related to beauty and temptation, possibly alluding to the biblical story of David and Bathsheba.",
