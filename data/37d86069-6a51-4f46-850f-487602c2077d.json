    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with shepherds tending to a flock of sheep. Above them, three winged figures, likely angels, descend from a golden, sun-like emanation, unfurling scrolls. One angel, in pink, is positioned on the left, another in blue in the center, and a third in light blue on the right. The landscape features rolling green hills, a body of water with a boat, and in the distance, a red building with towers, possibly a castle or fortified town. The shepherds, dressed in medieval attire, are engaged in their task, with one pointing upwards towards the celestial figures. A dog rests near the sheep. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, gilded border with floral motifs.",
