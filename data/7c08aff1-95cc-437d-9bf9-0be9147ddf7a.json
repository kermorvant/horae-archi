    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, likely monks or hermits, in a desolate, hilly landscape under a starry night sky. Some figures are seated or lying down, appearing weary or contemplative, while others are standing. In the background, a wooden palisade suggests a boundary or enclosure. To the right, a lone figure in a hooded robe kneels in prayer, facing a chalice or vessel placed on a mound. The overall atmosphere is one of solitude and spiritual devotion.",
