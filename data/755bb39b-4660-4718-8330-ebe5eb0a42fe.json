    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Margaret of Antioch, identifiable by her halo and the cross she holds, seated triumphantly atop a fearsome dragon. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a pink gown, her hands clasped in prayer. The dragon, with its mouth agape and tongue extended, appears subdued beneath her. In the upper part of the image, a bearded figure, likely God the Father, blesses the scene from a celestial realm indicated by a golden halo and rays. The background is a decorative tapestry of red and blue squares, with a stylized tree and rocky terrain to the left. The overall composition suggests a victory of faith over evil.",
