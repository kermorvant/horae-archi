    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a stylized bird with a sun-like motif above its head. The bird is rendered in profile, with its body composed of curved lines and hatched shading. Decorative foliage or floral elements frame the scene. The overall impression is one of ornamental design rather than a narrative depiction.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image appears to be a decorative border or initial, possibly featuring a symbolic representation. The sun motif could allude to divine light, Christ, or a saint. The bird itself might symbolize the soul, the Holy Spirit, or a specific saint depending on context not provided. Without further context, a specific religious interpretation is speculative.",
