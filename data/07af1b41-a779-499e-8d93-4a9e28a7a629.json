    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a vertical border filled with decorative elements. In the lower section, a coiled serpent or dragon-like creature is visible, its body segmented and covered in scales. Above this, a figure, possibly a man, is shown from the waist up, wearing a helmet or headdress with decorative plumes. His face is rendered with closed eyes and a serene expression. He appears to be holding a staff or a long object vertically. The upper portion of the border is filled with scrolling foliage and floral motifs, including a prominent flower with multiple petals. The overall impression is one of ornamental design rather than a narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image does not depict a recognizable biblical, liturgical, or devotional scene. It appears to be a decorative border, possibly from a printed book or manuscript, featuring stylized natural elements and a human-like figure. The serpent motif can sometimes symbolize evil or chaos, but without further context, its specific meaning here is unclear. The figure's serene expression and the surrounding ornamentation suggest a decorative rather than a narrative purpose.",
