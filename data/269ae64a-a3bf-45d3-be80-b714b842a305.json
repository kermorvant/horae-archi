    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a partially enclosed architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large wings and a halo, kneels and offers a lily to the Virgin Mary. He wears a pink and gold robe. The Virgin Mary, also with a halo, stands on the right, her hands clasped in prayer before an open book. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a gold tunic. Behind them, a dark, paneled wall is visible, with an arched window revealing a landscape of green hills and a blue sky. The scene is covered by a red, tiled dome supported by grey arches and columns. The floor is a checkered pattern of green and black tiles.",
