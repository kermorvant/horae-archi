    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded, elderly man, depicted with a pale complexion and long grey hair, sits reclined on a brown surface, his hands clasped over his chest. He is partially covered by a white cloth. Behind him, a dark, demonic figure with horns and a hunched posture raises a branch or club, poised to strike. The background is a stylized landscape with a blue sky, distant mountains, and hints of vegetation. The scene likely depicts the Temptation of Saint Anthony, a common theme in medieval art, where the saint is tormented by demons during his ascetic retreat.",
