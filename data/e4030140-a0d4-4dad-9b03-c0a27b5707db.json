    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated on a throne, holding the Christ Child on her lap. Both are looking at an open book. The Virgin Mary wears a dark robe and a veil. The Christ Child is dressed in a lighter garment. They are positioned within an architectural structure that resembles a niche or a throne with a canopy. Above them, two angels are depicted, one on each side, seemingly attending to the scene. To the left, another angel plays a musical instrument. The background is decorated with a patterned textile or tapestry. The overall scene suggests a devotional image, likely representing the Virgin and Child in a sacred context, possibly related to learning or contemplation, as indicated by the book.",
