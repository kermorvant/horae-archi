    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her blue mantle and halo, meeting Elizabeth, who is dressed in an orange robe and also has a halo. Elizabeth is shown gesturing towards Mary's abdomen, suggesting pregnancy. To the left, a bearded man, likely Saint Joseph, stands with a staff, his hand resting on Mary's shoulder. The figures are set against a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a body of water. In the background, a fortified castle with towers and walls is visible on a hill. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs and a patterned gold background within the arch.",
