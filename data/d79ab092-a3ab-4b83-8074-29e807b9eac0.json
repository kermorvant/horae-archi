    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts Christ seated on a golden arc, which appears to be a representation of the celestial sphere or a throne. He is shown with a halo, indicating his divinity, and bears the stigmata on his hands and feet, as well as a wound on his chest, signifying his crucifixion. He is draped in a pink robe over a red garment, and his right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or teaching. The background is a richly patterned mosaic of blue, red, and gold squares, suggesting a heavenly or divine setting. Below the arc, a patch of green grass with delicate plants is visible, grounding the scene in a terrestrial element. The overall impression is one of Christ's triumphant ascension and divine authority.",
