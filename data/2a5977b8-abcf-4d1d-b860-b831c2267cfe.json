    "scene_description_enriched": "Two elderly men with beards are depicted in profile, facing each other. The man on the left wears a green garment and holds a small object in his hand. The man on the right wears a blue garment and appears to be gesturing. The background is a muted brown with horizontal lines suggesting a wall or drapery. The figures are rendered with broad strokes and limited detail, typical of some medieval manuscript illuminations.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too abstract and lacks specific iconographic details to definitively interpret a religious or biblical event. It could represent a dialogue between two figures, possibly elders or prophets, but without further context, any interpretation would be speculative.",
