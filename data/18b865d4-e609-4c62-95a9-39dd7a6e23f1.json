    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of women, possibly engaged in prayer or conversation. The central figure on the left, wearing a veil and a long gown, has her hands clasped. She is surrounded by other women, also veiled and dressed in similar attire, some looking towards her and others in profile. The figures are rendered in a stylized, linear fashion typical of woodcuts or early manuscript illuminations. The background is plain, with no architectural elements or setting details visible, suggesting a focus on the figures themselves.",
