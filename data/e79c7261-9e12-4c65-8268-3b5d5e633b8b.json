    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, identifiable as Christ due to the halo, stands within an architectural frame. He is depicted with a beard and long hair, wearing a blue robe with gold stripes over a white garment. He holds a cross in his left arm and a book in his right hand. The background features a pink textile with gold star-like motifs, set against a dark blue curtain. The floor is a green and black checkered pattern. The architectural elements suggest a niche or a stylized interior space, with golden, ornate framing.",
