To her right stands an elderly man with a white beard and halo, also in blue robes and a brown mantle. Behind them, another man with a beard and halo is partially visible. In the middle ground, several figures in dark robes walk along a path in a hilly, green landscape. Rays of golden light descend from the upper sky, suggesting a divine presence. The background features rolling hills and a distant body of water under a blue sky.",
