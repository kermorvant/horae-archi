Behind him, to the left, is a grey building with red trim and vertical lines, possibly representing windows or decorative elements. To the right of this building, a taller, crenellated tower with red accents rises. Further to the right, a smaller building with a blue roof is visible. The background depicts a blue sky with a stylized sun emitting golden rays, and a green landscape with rounded bushes. In the foreground, a dark, curved element, possibly part of a wheel or a cart, is depicted.",
