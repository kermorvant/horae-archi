    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A group of figures stands around a table covered with a white, patterned cloth. In the center, an elderly man in green robes holds the Christ Child, who is swaddled in white. To his left, a woman in a blue mantle, likely the Virgin Mary, prays with clasped hands. Behind her, another woman in white veils looks on. To the right of the man holding the child, a figure in blue and a hat reads from a book. To the far left, a man in a red robe stands. Behind the figures, a grand architectural setting is suggested with tall columns and arched windows. A red canopy with gold trim hangs above the central action. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern, and the figures stand on a raised pink platform.",
