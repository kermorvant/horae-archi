    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, holding the swaddled Christ Child, stands to the left, accompanied by a female figure, possibly Saint Anne. Facing them is an elderly man, likely Simeon, wearing a headdress and holding a white cloth, presumably to receive the child. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by Gothic arches and ribbed vaults, suggesting a sacred or ceremonial space. Decorative elements, possibly floral motifs, frame the scene on the sides.",
