    "scene_description_enriched": "A monk, identifiable by his tonsured head and dark habit cinched with a white cord, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer and his gaze directed upwards. The stigmata are visible on his hands, indicated by red marks. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling blue hills in the background, suggesting a mountainous or elevated terrain. A stylized tree with green foliage is depicted on the right. The ground is rendered in green with hints of yellow and blue, and some sparse vegetation. The overall scene evokes a moment of intense spiritual devotion and contemplation.",
