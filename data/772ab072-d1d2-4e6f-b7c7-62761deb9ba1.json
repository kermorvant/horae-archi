    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with long hair and a beard, dressed in a blue tunic with gold trim and a red cape, kneels on a green grassy field. He is looking towards the right of the frame. On the ground near him are a golden helmet and a harp. In the background, a lush green landscape is dotted with trees and a distant city with multiple towers. Above the city, a winged angelic figure, depicted in red, descends from the sky, radiating golden light. To the right of the kneeling man, a section of a golden architectural structure with an archway is visible, and a red latticed fence encloses a pathway.",
