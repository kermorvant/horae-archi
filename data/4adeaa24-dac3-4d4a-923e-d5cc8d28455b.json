    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a dramatic moment within an interior space, likely a royal chamber. A king, seated on a raised platform and adorned with a crown and royal blue robes, presides over the scene. Before him, a woman in a blue, star-patterned gown kneels, presenting a baby. To her side, a soldier in armor, holding a sword aloft, appears to be in the act of threatening the infant. Another woman, standing to the left, holds a swaddled baby. The background features a richly patterned tapestry and a green, conical lamp or chandelier. The floor is a black and yellow checkered pattern. This scene is interpreted as the Judgment of Solomon, where the wise king is asked to determine the true mother of a child by proposing to divide it, thus revealing the birth mother through her maternal instinct.",
