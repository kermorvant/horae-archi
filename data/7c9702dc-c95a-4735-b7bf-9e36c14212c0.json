His body is marked with red stripes representing scourges, and blood is visible on his hands and chest. He holds a bundle of rods, likely symbolizing the instruments of his torture. The background is a vibrant blue adorned with scattered gold motifs, possibly representing divine light or abstract decorative elements. The lower part of the image shows the edge of the sarcophagus and a patterned texture within it.",
