    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer to the left, her hands clasped. Before her, the Christ Child lies on the ground, with a golden halo. Joseph, holding a lantern, stands behind the child, looking towards him. Another figure, possibly a shepherd or a midwife, kneels beside the child, also in prayer. In the background, a simple structure with a wooden roof is visible, suggesting a stable. The overall setting is humble, with a basket containing swaddling clothes and a candle on a candlestick adding to the domestic atmosphere. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with foliate motifs.",
