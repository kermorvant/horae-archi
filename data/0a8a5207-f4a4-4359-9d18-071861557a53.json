His hands and feet are pierced by nails, with blood visible. The background is a rich blue tapestry with gold geometric patterns and stylized motifs. To the left and right of the figure are architectural elements that appear to be parts of a larger structure, possibly representing a symbolic or heavenly setting. A shield with heraldic symbols is placed at the base of the cross.",
