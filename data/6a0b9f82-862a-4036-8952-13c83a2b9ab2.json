    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral landscape with a dense green forest in the background, several figures react to a divine apparition. At the top, an angel with blue wings descends within a golden oval halo, radiating golden light. Below, four figures are depicted. One man, leaning on a staff, looks upwards with his mouth open. Another figure, kneeling and with hands clasped in prayer, also gazes skyward. A woman stands with her arms raised in awe or supplication. A fourth figure, kneeling and looking upwards, wears a distinctive orange ruff. Sheep are visible in the middle ground. The scene appears to depict a moment of divine revelation or intervention.",
