    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ on the cross, rendered in a stylized manner. His body is emaciated, with wounds visible on his hands, feet, and torso, from which blood drips. He is wearing a white loincloth. His head is bowed, and his long, dark hair falls over his shoulders. The cross is a simple wooden structure. The background is a vibrant red, adorned with scattered gold star-like motifs. The base of the cross rests on a dark, earthy mound, with a hint of green foliage below.",
