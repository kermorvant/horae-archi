    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ, with a halo, is being lowered from the cross by two figures. One figure, dressed in green, supports Christ's body from above, while another, in a blue robe, holds his arm. A third figure, in a red tunic and yellow cap, kneels and appears to be removing nails from Christ's feet with tools. To the left, the Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, is shown grieving, with her hand to her face. Beside her, another figure, possibly St. John the Evangelist, also appears distressed. The background is a rich red with a gold geometric pattern. Above, stylized clouds and a crescent moon are visible. The entire scene is framed within an ornate, quatrefoil-shaped border with blue, red, and gold bands.",
