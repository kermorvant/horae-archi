    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies on a richly decorated bed. Two bearded men, likely representing Saint Joseph and another elder, stand behind the bed. One holds a candle, illuminating the scene, while the other clasps his hands in prayer. The figures are set within an architectural space suggested by a dark background and a window with tracery. A red, gold, and patterned canopy hangs above the figures, adding to the devotional atmosphere.",
