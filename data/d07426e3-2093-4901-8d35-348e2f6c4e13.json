Saint Christopher, a bearded man in a blue tunic and red cloak, holds a staff for support. The Christ Child, with a halo, is seated on his shoulders, raising a hand in blessing. In the background, to the left, a figure in a monastic habit stands in the doorway of a building with a circular window and two vertical openings. The setting is a body of water with distant hills and a simplified landscape.",
