    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel, clad in golden armor and with feathered wings, standing over a purple dragon. He holds a sword raised in his right hand, ready to strike, and a blue shield emblazoned with a golden sunburst in his left. The dragon, with its mouth agape, is being subdued beneath Saint Michael's feet. The background is a simple landscape with green hills and a blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. In the distance, a blue structure, possibly a building or a hill formation, is visible. This imagery represents the triumph of good over evil, a common theme associated with Saint Michael.",
