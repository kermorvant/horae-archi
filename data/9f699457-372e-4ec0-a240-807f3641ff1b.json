    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an interior architectural space with arched openings. In the foreground, a robed figure, likely a monk or cleric, stands facing a kneeling figure who appears to be receiving something from the standing figure. To the left, through an arched opening, a small, nude figure is visible, possibly representing a soul or a child. The architecture suggests a religious or monastic setting, with stone walls and arched doorways. The overall atmosphere is somber and devotional.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts an act of spiritual guidance or confession, possibly the Absolution of a sinner or the presentation of a soul to God. The kneeling figure represents penitence, while the standing figure acts as an intermediary or dispenser of grace. The small nude figure could symbolize innocence, a soul being cleansed, or even the Christ Child in a symbolic representation of divine mercy.",
