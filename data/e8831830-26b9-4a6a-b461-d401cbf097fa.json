    "scene_description_enriched": "Within an architectural frame, a bearded man with a golden halo sits on a rock in a lush, green landscape. He wears a simple, ochre-colored robe and holds an open book on his lap. The background depicts rolling hills, trees, and a distant city skyline under a blue sky with clouds. The scene is framed by a decorative border featuring columns and arches, rendered in red and gold, suggesting an illuminated manuscript page.",
