    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, richly dressed and wearing a headdress, is seated at a round table covered with a white tablecloth. She is holding a piece of bread to her mouth. A young boy in a white tunic stands beside her, holding a platter of bread. To the left, another young person, also in white, stands behind the seated woman. In the background, a small vignette depicts a nude figure pouring liquid from a jug into a vessel, set against a cloudy, ethereal sky. The interior setting features a dark, patterned wall and a large, ornate golden base supporting the table.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a meal or a moment of sustenance. The vignette in the background, showing a figure pouring liquid, could allude to the sacrament of the Eucharist or a more general theme of nourishment and divine provision.",
