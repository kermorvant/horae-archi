    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with his body pale and bloodied, crowned with thorns, and nailed to a wooden cross. Two blue winged figures, possibly angels, are positioned on either side of the cross, one holding a chalice to collect Christ's blood. Below, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, stands to the left, her head bowed in sorrow. To the right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, leans his head on his hand, holding a book, also in mourning. Above the cross, a blue figure representing God the Father is depicted with outstretched arms, radiating golden light. The setting is an outdoor landscape with green hills, sparse vegetation, and a tree on the right. The scene is framed by an ornate border with gold leaf.",
