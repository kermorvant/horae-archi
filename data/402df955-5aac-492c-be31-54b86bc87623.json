    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned female figure, likely a saint, standing indoors. She wears a blue tunic, a white surcoat with ermine trim, and a golden crown. A brown cloak drapes over her shoulders. In her left hand, she holds a large sword upright, and in her right, a book. To her left, on the floor, lies a broken wheel and two small tools, possibly a hammer and chisel. The background features a green tapestry with gold ornamentation, behind which are dark columns and two arched windows with diamond-shaped tracery. The floor is tiled in a grid pattern. The figure's attributes, particularly the broken wheel, identify her as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a virgin martyr often depicted with these symbols of her torture and faith.",
