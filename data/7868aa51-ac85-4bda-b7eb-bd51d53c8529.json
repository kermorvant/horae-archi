    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue robe, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child reaches out towards a golden chalice offered by one of the Magi, who kneels before them. Another Magus stands behind, holding a crown and a golden vessel. A third Magus, dressed in green, also holds a golden chalice. The figures are set in an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, a tree, and a distant city with spires. A simple, thatched structure provides shelter for Mary and the Child. A star shines in the upper left corner, a traditional symbol of the Nativity.",
