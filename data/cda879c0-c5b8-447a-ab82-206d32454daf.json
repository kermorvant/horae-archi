    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. In the foreground, a winged figure, likely an angel, kneels and gestures towards a seated woman. Behind this woman, another female figure stands, her hands clasped in prayer. Further back, a third female figure is visible, and above them, architectural elements suggest a building with arched openings and possibly towers or spires in the distance. The overall composition suggests a religious narrative, possibly the Annunciation or Visitation, given the presence of an angel and the devotional posture of the figures.",
