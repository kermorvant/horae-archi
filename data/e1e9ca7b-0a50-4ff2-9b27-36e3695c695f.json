    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, possibly representing a peasant or laborer, is depicted within an illuminated initial. The figure wears a blue hood and tunic, with a reddish-brown cloak draped over their shoulders. They are holding a tool that resembles a scythe or a hoe over their left shoulder. Their right hand is raised to their mouth, and they appear to be blowing or speaking into a cloud-like form filled with lines, suggesting a breath or a word. The background is a shimmering gold leaf, typical of manuscript illumination, and the initial is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs. The overall scene is stylized and symbolic rather than naturalistic.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a figure from the Old Testament or a saint, possibly associated with a specific psalm or devotional text. The act of blowing or speaking into a cloud could symbolize the divine breath, prophecy, or the utterance of God's word. Without further context from the manuscript, a precise interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of divine inspiration or communication.",
