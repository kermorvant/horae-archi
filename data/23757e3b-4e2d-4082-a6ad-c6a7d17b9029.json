He wears a pink tunic beneath a vibrant blue mantle, both trimmed with gold. In his left hand, he holds an open book inscribed with text. His right hand grasps a large, ornate key, a symbol of his authority. The background is divided: the upper portion features a dark, tessellated pattern of red, blue, and gold squares, while the lower portion shows a green ground with stylized floral motifs. The overall presentation is devotional, focusing on the saint and his attributes.",
