    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure with a radiant halo, playing a flute. This figure is seated on a throne-like structure. Surrounding the central figure are stylized architectural elements resembling towers or spires, some with arched openings. The background is filled with a starry pattern, suggesting a celestial or night setting. The overall composition is framed by decorative elements, possibly representing the border of a manuscript page.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure with a radiant halo playing a flute, surrounded by architectural forms and a starry sky, is likely an allegorical representation. It could symbolize a celestial musician, a personification of music, or a divine entity associated with harmony and the heavens. Without further context, a specific biblical or devotional event is not definitively identifiable, but it evokes a sense of divine presence and celestial music.",
