    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal court setting where a king, seated and holding a sword, receives a woman presenting a child. The king is dressed in blue and wears a crown. The woman, in a green mantle, holds the Christ Child. To the left, a soldier in armor, with a blue helmet and red tunic, stands guard. Behind the king, two figures in green robes are visible, one appearing to be a servant or attendant. The background suggests an interior space with a patterned wall and a wooden floor. The overall composition suggests a scene of presentation or judgment, possibly related to the infancy of Christ or a royal lineage.",
