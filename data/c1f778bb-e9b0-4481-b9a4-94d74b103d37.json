    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely Christ, with a halo and beard, holding a globe in his left hand and a cross in his right. He is surrounded by several other figures, some appearing to be in distress or awe. Below the central figure, a warrior saint, possibly Saint George, is shown in armor, holding a spear and a shield, triumphing over a dragon-like creature. The background features architectural elements that suggest a stylized, possibly divine, setting with decorative arches and towers.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The central figure with the globe and cross represents Christ as the Pantocrator or Savior of the World. The warrior saint subduing a dragon is a common iconography for saints like Saint George, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil or Christ's victory over Satan. The overall scene likely conveys a message of divine power, salvation, and the ultimate victory of righteousness.",
