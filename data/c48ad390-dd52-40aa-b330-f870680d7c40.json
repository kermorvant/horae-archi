    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, depicted as a knight in full armor, stands in a verdant landscape. He wears a red surcoat adorned with a white cross, and golden armor. A sword is sheathed at his side, and he holds a shield bearing a similar white cross. Behind him, a winding path leads up a blue hill to a castle with multiple towers. In the background to the left, a cluster of stylized trees and small mounds dot the green terrain under a blue sky. The figure is identified as Saint George, a Christian martyr and soldier, often depicted in armor and associated with slaying a dragon, though no dragon is present in this scene. The castle on the hill may allude to his legend or a symbolic representation of a stronghold of faith.",
