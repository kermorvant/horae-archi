    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts David, a young man with long brown hair, wearing a red tunic and blue hose, standing over the fallen body of Goliath. David holds a sling in his right hand, poised to strike, and a staff in his left. Goliath, clad in golden armor, lies on the ground with a bloody wound on his forehead, his head turned to the side. The background is a rolling green landscape with trees and a distant city skyline under a blue sky. The image is framed by an ornamental border typical of Books of Hours.",
