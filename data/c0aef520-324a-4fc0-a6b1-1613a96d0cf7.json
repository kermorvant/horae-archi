    "scene_description_enriched": "A white goat with long, curved horns stands on a golden, table-like structure. Below, a group of men, some with beards and wearing blue and green robes, look up at the goat with hands clasped in prayer or awe. The background is a rich red, textured with gold and grey cloud-like forms, and a blue celestial band with gold stars at the top. The scene appears to be a devotional or symbolic representation, possibly related to a sacrifice or a miraculous event, given the reverent posture of the onlookers and the prominent placement of the goat.",
