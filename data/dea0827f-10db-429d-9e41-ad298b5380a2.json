    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an arched architectural setting. A kneeling figure, likely the Virgin Mary, presents a swaddled infant, the Christ Child, to a robed figure wearing a mitre and holding an open book. This figure, presumably a priest or bishop, gestures with one hand. Behind the kneeling figure stand two individuals, one holding a staff and the other a basket. Another man stands behind the priest. The architecture features a vaulted ceiling with a hanging lamp, columns, and patterned walls. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern. This scene is interpreted as the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, a significant event in Christian liturgy and devotion.",
