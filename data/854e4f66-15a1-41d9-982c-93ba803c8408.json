    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child, who also has a halo. Saint Joseph, also with a halo, walks beside the donkey, holding a staff and a hammer, and looking upwards. The background is a grid pattern, suggesting a stylized or abstract setting, possibly representing a textile or a symbolic representation of space. Decorative borders frame the scene.",
