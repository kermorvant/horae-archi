    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, bleeding from his wounds. Below the cross, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold stars, stands with her hands clasped in prayer, accompanied by a figure in a red and gold robe, likely Saint John the Evangelist. To the right, a woman kneels, holding a white cloth towards Christ's feet, possibly representing Mary Magdalene. Behind them, a group of soldiers and onlookers observe the scene. The setting is an outdoor landscape with a blue sky and distant trees, framed by an architectural border with columns and arches.",
