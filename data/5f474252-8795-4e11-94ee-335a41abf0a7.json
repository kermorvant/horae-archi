    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child who is dressed in red. Beside them walks a bearded man, presumably Saint Joseph, leading the donkey. The background features a stylized landscape with rolling hills, scattered trees, and distant buildings resembling a fortified town or castle. The overall impression is one of travel through a somewhat rugged terrain.",
