    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Moses, identifiable by his staff and halo, wading through turbulent waters. He is accompanied by two other figures. One, also haloed, appears to be carrying a smaller figure or object. The second figure, to the right, is hooded and holds a musical instrument, possibly a harp or lyre. The background shows a stylized landscape with hills and sparse trees under a blue sky. The overall scene represents the Crossing of the Red Sea, a pivotal event in the Old Testament where Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt.",
