    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely a saint or a holy person, kneeling with hands clasped in prayer. They are surrounded by other figures, one on the left with a veiled head and elaborate clothing, and another on the right wearing a distinctive hat and cloak. Above them, partially obscured, are what appear to be celestial beings or angels, suggested by their placement and the halo-like forms around their heads. The overall impression is one of a devotional or spiritual moment, possibly a martyrdom or a vision, set against a dark, undefined background that emphasizes the figures.",
