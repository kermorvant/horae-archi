    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a gathering of figures, all with halos, under a radiant dove representing the Holy Spirit. In the foreground, a man sits on a block, holding an open book. To his left, a woman stands with her hands clasped in prayer. Other figures are clustered around them, some looking upwards, others engaged in conversation or contemplation. The setting appears to be indoors, with a tiled floor visible. The overall composition suggests a significant religious event, likely the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and Mary.",
