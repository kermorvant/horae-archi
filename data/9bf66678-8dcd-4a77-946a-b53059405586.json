    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a castle complex with multiple towers and varied rooflines, set against a backdrop of rolling hills and lush greenery. In the foreground, a body of water contains two fish swimming. A solitary figure, possibly a man, walks along a path leading towards the castle, accompanied by a small dog. The overall impression is one of a serene, albeit somewhat stylized, landscape with architectural elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a specific biblical or devotional event. It appears to be a landscape vignette, possibly illustrating a psalm or a general theme of nature and human presence within a built environment. The presence of fish might allude to themes of creation or sustenance.",
