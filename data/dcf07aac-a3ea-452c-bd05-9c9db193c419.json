He wears a red robe with gold trim and a blue cloak, and a purple cap. A halo surrounds his head, indicating his sainthood. He is seated on a throne-like structure draped with a green cloth. To his right, an ox with a halo lies on the floor, which is tiled in a checkered pattern. The background is dark and striated, suggesting an interior space, possibly a study or scriptorium. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
