    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a golden halo, rides a grey donkey, holding the Christ Child swaddled in white. She wears a vibrant blue mantle adorned with gold trim. Accompanying them is a bearded man, likely Joseph, wearing a dark hat, a blue collar, and a burgundy robe. He leads the donkey by a golden rope and carries a white cloth bundle over his shoulder. The scene unfolds in a pastoral landscape with rolling green hills, scattered trees, and a distant city featuring towers with blue roofs and flags. Birds are depicted in the sky above the city.",
