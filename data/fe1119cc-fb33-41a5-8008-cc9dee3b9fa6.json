    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned man, likely King David, kneeling in prayer outdoors. He wears a royal blue mantle over a grey tunic and has a beard and a crown. His hands are clasped in supplication, and he looks upwards towards a divine figure emerging from a blue cloud. To his right, a golden harp stands prominently. In the background, a walled city with numerous towers and buildings, including a prominent church with a dome and spires, is visible. The landscape is hilly and green, with trees and pathways.",
