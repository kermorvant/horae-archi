    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a kneeling figure, possibly a shepherd or farmer, holding a bundle of stalks or reeds. To the right of the figure is a stylized architectural element resembling a small shrine or tabernacle, with a domed roof. Further to the right, a ram is shown lying down. In the background, a simplified representation of a walled city or castle with towers is visible on a hilly landscape. The overall composition suggests an outdoor pastoral or agricultural setting.",

The ram is a common symbol in Christian iconography, often representing Christ (the Lamb of God) or the faithful. The architectural element could be interpreted as a shrine or a representation of a dwelling, grounding the scene in a human or devotional context.",
