    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed male figures stand in an interior architectural setting. The figure on the left, identified by his keys, is likely Saint Peter. He wears a golden tunic and a blue mantle, and holds a large, ornate key with a cross on it. The figure on the right, possibly Saint Paul, wears a green striped tunic and a red cloak, and holds a sword. The background depicts a wall with vertical lines suggesting architectural elements like pilasters or columns, and a doorway or opening with a green, patterned curtain or tapestry.",
