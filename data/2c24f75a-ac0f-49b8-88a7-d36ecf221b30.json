    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king, identified by his crown, standing in the center, gesturing with his hands. He is surrounded by a group of men, some wearing crowns or elaborate headwear, and others with beards. To the left, a group of women, all with white head coverings, stand facing the king. The setting appears to be an interior space with a tiled floor and a backdrop of columns and a blue sky suggesting an open, perhaps porticoed, area. The architectural elements are minimal, focusing on the figures and their interaction. The scene likely represents a royal audience or a significant event involving the king and his subjects, possibly with a religious undertone given the context of a Book of Hours.",
