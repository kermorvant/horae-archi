    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with rolling hills, a river, and a lone tree. In the foreground, three figures are gathered: one plays bagpipes, another holds a bowl, and a third stands with a shepherd's crook. Several sheep are scattered around them, and a dog looks upwards. Above, an angel with wings unfurled descends from a starry blue sky, holding a scroll with Latin text. The overall scene evokes a peaceful, idyllic rural setting, likely representing a moment of divine announcement or blessing upon humble shepherds.",
