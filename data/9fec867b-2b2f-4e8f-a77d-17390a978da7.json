The figure stands centrally, with arms outstretched. Surrounding the figure are banners with inscriptions in Latin and stars, suggesting a celestial or astrological context. Above the figure's head is a sun with a human face. At the feet of the central figure, a jester-like figure is seated, holding a smaller figure or puppet. The overall composition is highly symbolic, likely relating to medical or astrological beliefs of the medieval period.",
