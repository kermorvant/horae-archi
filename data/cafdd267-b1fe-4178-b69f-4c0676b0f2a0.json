    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed women, identified as the Virgin Mary and Saint Elizabeth, embracing. The Virgin Mary, on the left, wears a vibrant blue robe and has long, golden, curly hair. Saint Elizabeth, on the right, is dressed in a red robe over a patterned gold and black garment, and wears a white veil covering her head. They are positioned in a landscape setting with rolling green hills and trees in the background. Behind them, two imposing, dark, cylindrical towers rise against a blue sky with scattered golden clouds. The embrace between the two women signifies their meeting after the Annunciation and the conception of Christ and John the Baptist, respectively.",
