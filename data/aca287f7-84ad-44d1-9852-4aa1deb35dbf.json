    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, sits holding the Christ Child. Three kings, identified by their crowns, approach them. The first king, in a brown robe, offers a chalice. The second king, in a blue tunic, holds another vessel. The third king kneels, presenting his gifts. Behind them, a simple thatched-roof structure is visible, suggesting a humble dwelling. The background features rolling green hills, trees, and a distant city. The sky is a deep blue with a single star.",
