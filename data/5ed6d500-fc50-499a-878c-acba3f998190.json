    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession moving through a city at night, under a starry sky. In the foreground, a central figure, likely a prisoner, is led by soldiers. The prisoner wears a striped robe and appears to be bound. The soldiers are clad in armor and helmets. Behind them, a large crowd follows, some carrying torches that cast an orange glow. In the background, a walled city with numerous pointed roofs and a prominent tower is visible. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, golden archway, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
