    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity with the Virgin Mary. God the Father, crowned and bearded, sits on the left, holding a blue orb and a book. The Holy Spirit is represented as a white dove flying between God the Father and Christ. Christ, also bearded, sits to the right of God the Father, holding a book and gesturing with his right hand. An angel with blue wings stands behind them, holding a crown above the Virgin Mary, who kneels in prayer on the right, clad in a blue robe. The figures are set against a gold background, with red, winged figures and blue clouds at the top and bottom edges, suggesting a celestial or divine setting. A light blue, stepped platform is visible beneath God the Father and Christ.",
