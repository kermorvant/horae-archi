    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an interior space with architectural elements suggesting a religious or scholarly setting. On the left, a figure stands behind a railing, possibly a choir screen, with what appears to be an altar or lectern in front of them. In the center, two figures in clerical robes are reading from a book. To the right, a seated figure, also with a book, is positioned within an arched architectural structure. The overall impression is one of devotion and study, likely within a church or monastic context.",
