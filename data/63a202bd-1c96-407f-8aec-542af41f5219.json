    "scene_description_enriched": "A young woman with long, flowing blonde hair, wearing a rich red gown, is seated in a garden setting. She is holding a circular object, possibly a wreath or a basket, adorned with small blue and red flowers. Behind her, a trellis covered in green foliage and small red and blue blossoms frames the scene on the left. In the background, a stone tower with a tiled roof and adjacent buildings are visible, suggesting a domestic or monastic complex. The overall impression is one of serene contemplation in a cultivated outdoor space.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a devotional theme, possibly representing a virtuous woman engaged in a peaceful activity, or a symbolic representation of a garden of love or contemplation. The flowers could hold symbolic meaning, though without further context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific interpretation. It could also be a representation of a specific saint or a figure from secular literature.",
