    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child. Saint Joseph, with a halo and a long beard, walks beside them, leading the donkey. In the background, a walled city with towers and crenellations is visible, suggesting their destination or a place of refuge. A bare tree stands in the middle ground, and the landscape is dotted with bushes. A figure, possibly an angel or a demon, is perched atop a tower in the far left, observing the scene. The ground beneath the donkey's hooves is littered with small objects, possibly provisions or debris from their journey.",
