    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a tender embrace between a bearded man wearing a blue and gold patterned cap and a red cloak over a blue tunic, and a woman veiled in white with a blue mantle. Both figures have golden halos, indicating their saintly status. The man's left arm is around the woman's shoulders, and his right hand rests on her arm. The woman's hands are clasped over her abdomen. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or idealized setting, with hints of architectural elements in vertical gold bands on the right. The overall impression is one of intimacy and reverence.",
