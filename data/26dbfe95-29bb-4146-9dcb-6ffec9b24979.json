    "scene_description_enriched": "A brown bird of prey, likely a falcon or hawk, is depicted in the act of attacking a rabbit. The bird has its talons firmly gripping the rabbit, which lies on its back with its legs in the air, appearing to struggle. The bird's beak is inserted into the rabbit's head. The scene is set against a background of stylized foliage and small, dark, insect-like creatures. A decorative border with red and blue elements is visible in the upper left corner. The ground beneath the rabbit is a green, undulating shape with a brown outline. The overall impression is one of a violent natural event, possibly symbolizing the struggle between predator and prey or a more allegorical conflict.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene, depicting a bird of prey attacking a rabbit, is likely an example of bestiary imagery or a symbolic representation of natural conflict. In medieval bestiaries, animals were often imbued with moral or religious meanings. The falcon, for instance, could symbolize divine justice or the power of God, while the rabbit might represent the vulnerable soul or the sinner. The act of predation could thus be interpreted as the struggle for salvation, divine judgment, or the triumph of good over evil. Without further context from the manuscript, a definitive interpretation is challenging, but it aligns with the common use of animal symbolism in medieval devotional art.",
