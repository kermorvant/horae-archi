    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures embracing. The figure on the left, a man with a long beard and wearing a turban-like headdress, is embracing a woman who is wearing a veil. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior setting, with a large arched structure and what appears to be a building with windows. The embrace between the figures suggests intimacy or a significant emotional moment. Without further iconographic cues, the specific event remains ambiguous, but the composition implies a devotional or narrative scene.",
