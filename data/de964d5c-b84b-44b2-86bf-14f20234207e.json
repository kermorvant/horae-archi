    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king seated on a throne, receiving a golden vessel from a kneeling figure. The king wears a blue robe and a golden crown. The kneeling figure is dressed in an orange tunic and a white mantle, and holds the vessel with both hands. To the right of the king, three figures stand. One, with a halo, is dressed in blue and appears to be speaking or gesturing. Two other figures, clad in armor, stand behind him. The background features a patterned tapestry and a starry blue sky. The ground is green and sparsely decorated with stylized plants. This scene likely represents a biblical or royal event, possibly a presentation of tribute or a significant offering.",
