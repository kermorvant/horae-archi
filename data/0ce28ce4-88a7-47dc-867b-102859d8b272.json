    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue robe and halo, stands before a wooden lectern with an open book. Her hands are clasped in a gesture of piety or surprise. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, with large blue wings and wearing a red cloak over a white tunic, kneels and holds a scroll inscribed with Latin text. Above and behind Gabriel, a depiction of God the Father is visible in a celestial setting, blessing the scene. The architecture includes an arched opening with decorative elements, suggesting an interior space with a view into another chamber or a more distant scene. The background features rich drapery and patterned walls, contributing to a sense of domestic or sacred interior.",
