    "scene_description_enriched": "A young woman with long, flowing auburn hair, wearing a green gown, is seated on an ornate throne. She holds a white rose in her right hand, gazing downwards with a pensive expression. The throne is richly decorated with carved figures in niches and circular medallions depicting scenes of struggle or torment. Behind her, a wall is constructed of large, roughly hewn stones, and above this, a series of arched niches contain standing figures, possibly saints or prophets. The overall setting suggests an interior space, possibly a royal or divine chamber, with architectural elements that evoke a sense of grandeur and religious significance.",
