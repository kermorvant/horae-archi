    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Jesus in a purple robe and white sash, with a halo, gesturing with his hands towards a man in a blue robe and orange tunic who is kneeling and looking up at him. Around them, a group of onlookers observe the interaction. To the left, a young boy in a patterned tunic kneels and holds a basin of water. The setting appears to be an interior space with a vaulted ceiling supported by columns, and arched windows along the back wall. This scene is likely an illustration of Jesus healing a person, possibly the healing of the blind man or a similar miracle of restoration, emphasizing Jesus' divine power and compassion.",
