    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in an outdoor setting with a hilly landscape in the background. On the left, a man with a beard and a cap is kneeling with his hands clasped in prayer. He wears a robe and carries a staff with a leaf-like finial. In the center, another figure, possibly a monk or a pilgrim, is hooded and also appears to be praying or gesturing. To the right, a third man, also bearded and wearing a cap, carries a large, heavily laden sack on his back, supported by a staff. He looks upwards with his hands clasped. The overall impression is one of a devotional or penitential journey.",
