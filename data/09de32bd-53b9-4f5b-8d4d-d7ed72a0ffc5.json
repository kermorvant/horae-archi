    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated and reading a book. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a purple tunic. To her right, the Angel Gabriel, with large green and purple wings, gestures with his right hand, pointing upwards, and holds a golden staff. A white dove, representing the Holy Spirit, flies above and to the right of the angel. The background suggests an interior space with a bed canopy on the left and architectural elements like columns and arches framing the scene. The overall impression is one of divine revelation and the beginning of Christ's earthly mission.",
