    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified as Saint Catherine of Alexandria by her iconography, stands in a grassy outdoor setting. She is depicted with long blonde hair, wearing a white tunic over a golden skirt and a crimson cloak. In her left hand, she holds an open book, and in her right, a scepter or torch. A large sword rests point-down in the ground before her, its hilt near her hand. At her feet lies a defeated figure, possibly a pagan emperor or philosopher, wearing a green crown and lying on a blue cloth. Behind her, a large wooden wheel, a symbol of her martyrdom, stands prominently. In the background, a fortified castle or city with towers and walls is visible, suggesting a historical or allegorical setting. The scene likely represents the triumph of faith and reason over paganism and persecution.",
