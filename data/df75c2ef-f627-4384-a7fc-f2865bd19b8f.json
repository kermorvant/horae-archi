    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Baptist, recognizable by his halo and beard, standing in water and holding a staff. He is dressed in a white tunic and a red garment. Above and behind him, a haloed child, likely representing Christ, is shown reaching out with an object, possibly a globe. In the background, to the left, is a depiction of a town or city with buildings featuring domed roofs and arched windows. The setting is predominantly aquatic, with the figures immersed in water, suggesting a river or baptismal site. The overall composition is characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination, with a flat perspective and symbolic representation.",
