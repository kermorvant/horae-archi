    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, veiled and wearing a dark robe, cradles the Christ Child who is seated on her lap. The Christ Child, with a halo, raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing and points upwards with his left hand. Before them kneels a bearded man in a dark hooded cloak, offering a chalice. Behind him stand two kings, identifiable by their crowns. One king, to the left, looks towards the Virgin and Child. The other king, to the right, points upwards, possibly towards a star, and is depicted with a more elaborate crown. The background is a mottled, dark texture, suggesting a night sky or a stylized landscape. The figures are framed by decorative borders.",
