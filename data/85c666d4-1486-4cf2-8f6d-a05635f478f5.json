    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man with a long beard, dressed in a white robe with gold trim, sits at a wooden lectern, writing with a quill. Beside him stands a winged bull, its head turned towards the man. The scene is set within an architectural space with a tiled floor and columns visible in the background, through which a distant landscape with buildings can be seen. This imagery represents Saint Luke, one of the Four Evangelists, accompanied by his traditional symbol, the bull, as he writes his Gospel.",
