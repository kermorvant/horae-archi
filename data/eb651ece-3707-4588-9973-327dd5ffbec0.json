The Virgin Mary is dressed in a draped robe and veil, with a halo. The Christ Child is held in her arms, with one arm raised. The angel on the left plays a harp, and the angel on the right plays a lute. Both angels have halos and wings. They are positioned within a tent-like structure with a patterned backdrop. The tent is decorated with stars and circular motifs. The overall impression is one of a serene and devotional gathering, likely representing a moment of repose or contemplation.",
