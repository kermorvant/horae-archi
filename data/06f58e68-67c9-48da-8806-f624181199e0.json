    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony, likely the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, within an ornate architectural setting. A bishop, adorned with a jeweled mitre and blue robes, officiates the ritual, holding a swaddled infant. A woman in a blue mantle kneels before him, presenting the child. To the left, a man in a red cloak and green tunic observes, while behind him, two other figures are visible. To the right, three women in elaborate attire look on. The background features a golden altarpiece with sculpted figures, possibly representing Moses and other prophets, and a rich red curtain. The floor is tiled, and the entire scene is framed by golden architectural elements, suggesting a sacred space.",
