    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a nude woman with clasped hands, seated and looking upwards. Beside her, a nude man reclines with his head resting on his hand. A robed male figure with a halo stands to the left, reaching towards the seated woman. Behind the figures, architectural elements suggest a structured setting, including what appears to be a large vessel or font and decorative architectural framing. The composition suggests a narrative of creation or temptation, likely depicting Adam and Eve with God.",
