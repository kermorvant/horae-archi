    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a man in the foreground, dressed in a pink tunic and white hose, throwing stones at a herd of wild boars. A dog stands attentively beside him. In the background, a dense forest with tall, slender trees dominates the middle ground, with several figures tending to sheep or pigs within its depths. To the far left, a castle with turrets and battlements is nestled on a hill. Above the landscape, a celestial calendar or zodiac wheel is depicted, featuring astrological signs, lunar phases, and celestial bodies, indicating the month of November and the zodiac sign Scorpio. This imagery suggests a connection between the earthly activities and the cosmic order.",
