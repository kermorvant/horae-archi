    "scene_description_enriched": "A stylized depiction of a hand, rendered in white with red markings indicating wounds, emerges from a cluster of green, leafy foliage. The hand is positioned centrally, with fingers slightly splayed. The background is a deep, textured purple, suggesting a spiritual or celestial realm. The entire scene is framed by an ornamental border featuring red and white motifs.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The wounded hand is a potent symbol of Christ's Passion and sacrifice, often referred to as the Stigmata. The presence of blood on the hand directly references the wounds Christ sustained during his crucifixion. The leafy foliage may symbolize resurrection or new life, often associated with Christ's victory over death.",
