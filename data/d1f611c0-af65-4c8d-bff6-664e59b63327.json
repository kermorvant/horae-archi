    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pair of scales, a common symbol of judgment and justice, suspended from a horizontal beam. The scales are empty, suggesting a moment before or after weighing. Behind the scales is a richly patterned tapestry or wall hanging, adorned with gold stars and intricate designs, suggesting a formal or divine setting. The ground is depicted as a textured surface with small green tufts, possibly representing sparse vegetation. Above, a blue sky with clouds is visible, and a slender, pointed spire rises from the center of the scene, possibly representing a celestial element or a symbolic structure. The entire scene is framed within a circular medallion, surrounded by decorative borders typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
