    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three shepherds in a green, rolling landscape, looking upwards towards a flying angel. The angel, with golden hair and wings, is depicted in a purplish-gold robe, holding a scroll with Latin text. The shepherds are dressed in medieval attire: one in blue and red with a hood, another in brown and blue, and the third in red and blue with a cape. They are gesturing towards the angel, their faces expressing awe or surprise. In the background, a river flows past a distant city with prominent towers. A flock of sheep is visible in the lower right corner of the scene. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, arched border with gold and blue decorative elements.",
