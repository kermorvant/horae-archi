The angel wears a robe adorned with a cross on the chest and a circular emblem on the left side. The background is filled with stars, suggesting a celestial or night setting. Above the angel, an arched architectural element, possibly representing a vault or canopy, frames the scene. The overall style is reminiscent of woodcut or early printmaking.",
