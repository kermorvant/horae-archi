    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures engaged in agricultural labor outdoors. A man, wearing a straw hat and a white tunic, wields a scythe, preparing to cut a swath of grass or grain. Beside him, a woman, also wearing a hat and a red jacket over a white blouse and a dark skirt, gathers stalks of grain in her hands. In the background, a large haystack is visible, along with trees and a blue sky with golden clouds. The overall impression is one of rural work during harvest time. This scene likely represents the month of August or the agricultural cycle, a common theme in Books of Hours for devotional purposes, reminding viewers of the bounty of the earth and the labor required to sustain life.",
