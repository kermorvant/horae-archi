    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, where Mary, veiled and with a halo, is embraced by an older woman, likely Elizabeth, who is also veiled and wears a red robe. A bearded man, possibly Zechariah, stands behind Elizabeth, his hand on her shoulder. They are positioned in front of a pale grey building with arched openings and small, diamond-paned windows. The architectural setting suggests a religious or domestic context, with the figures rendered in a devotional manner, emphasizing their spiritual connection.",
