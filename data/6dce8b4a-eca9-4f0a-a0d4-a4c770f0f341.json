    "scene_description_enriched": "A kneeling figure in an orange robe, with hands clasped in prayer, faces a seated king in blue robes and a crown. The king holds a scepter and gestures towards the kneeling figure. Behind the king is a bed with blue hangings. The scene appears to be set within an interior space, suggested by the architectural elements and the presence of furniture. The background is decorated with a patterned textile and features celestial or allegorical elements, including a large, stylized creature or cloud formation with eyes and a mouth, and scattered insects or stars. The overall composition suggests a narrative or devotional scene, possibly depicting a plea or a divine message.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of supplication or divine revelation. The king could be a biblical figure like King David, known for his prayers and psalms, or a symbolic representation of earthly authority receiving spiritual guidance. The kneeling figure might be a petitioner or a prophet. The celestial elements and the unusual creature could symbolize divine intervention or the spiritual realm influencing the earthly one.",
