    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures, one seated and the other kneeling in prayer. The seated figure, with long, wavy hair and a beard, is dressed in flowing robes. The kneeling figure, wearing a cap and robes, has their hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, an arched architectural element frames a cityscape with towers and buildings. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene set within a stylized architectural context.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a devotional moment, possibly a prayer or supplication. The presence of multiple figures and the cityscape in the background could suggest a scene from the Old Testament or a saint's life, though without further context, a specific interpretation is difficult. The kneeling figure's posture strongly indicates prayer.",
