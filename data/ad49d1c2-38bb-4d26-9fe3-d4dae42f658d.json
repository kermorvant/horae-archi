    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a classical temple structure with Corinthian columns. On the left, a figure in elaborate religious vestments, including a mitre, stands before an altar with flames. On the right, the Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue and red, kneels and cradles the Christ Child. Behind them, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills, trees, and distant architectural ruins. In the upper portion of the image, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, emerges from clouds, with an arm extended.",
