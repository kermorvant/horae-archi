    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary and the Apostles gathered together. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, is seated to the left, with her hands raised in a gesture of prayer or supplication, looking down at an open book on a wooden lectern. To her right, several male figures, identified as Apostles by their halos and context, are also shown in prayer. One prominent figure in the foreground, with a grey beard, clasps his hands together. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light emanating from it. The background is a dark, textured wall, and the scene is framed by ornate golden architectural elements at the top, suggesting an interior setting.",
