    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman in a vibrant blue robe kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer. She is positioned in the foreground, facing towards an arched opening that looks out onto a landscape. Behind her, to the left, stand three figures, two of whom are looking towards the kneeling woman. The background interior features a red curtain and architectural elements suggesting a room or chamber. The overall composition suggests a moment of private devotion or contemplation, possibly within a domestic or sacred space, with the exterior landscape offering a contrast or a symbolic backdrop.",
