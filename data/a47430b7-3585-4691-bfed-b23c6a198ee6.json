    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act occurring in an outdoor, hilly landscape under a blue sky. In the foreground, a man in an orange tunic is striking another man in a dark tunic with a club or heavy object. The victim's head is bleeding profusely, with red streams flowing down his face and onto his clothing. In the background, a pyre of logs is burning intensely. To the left, two figures are engaged in agricultural labor: one is digging with a shovel, and another, a woman, is seated and appears to be spinning. Scattered bones are visible on the ground, suggesting past violence or sacrifice. The overall impression is one of brutality and possibly martyrdom.",
