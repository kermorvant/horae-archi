The central figures are the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle and veil, and the Christ Child, wearing a red tunic and halo. The Christ Child reaches out his hand towards the Virgin Mary. To the left, a woman in a red garment and green skirt, holding a staff, appears to be leading or accompanying them. To the right, two other women, one in a pink dress and the other in a blue dress, are also present, with the woman in blue embracing the woman in pink.
