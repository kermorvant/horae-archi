    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist standing in an outdoor landscape. He is dressed in a red cloak over a blue tunic, with gold trim on both garments. His halo indicates his saintly status. He holds a golden chalice in his left hand, from which a small black dragon is emerging. His right hand is raised, gesturing towards the chalice. Behind him, a slender tree stands to his right, and in the distance, rolling hills are dotted with stylized castles and a body of water. The foreground shows a path with scattered stones. The overall impression is one of a devotional image set in a simplified, idealized natural environment.",
