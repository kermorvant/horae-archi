    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A bearded man, likely Simeon, wearing a blue robe and a jeweled hat, holds the Christ Child, who is swaddled in white. The Christ Child has a halo. Facing them, a woman in a blue mantle kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. She has long blonde hair and a halo. To the left, another woman, possibly Anna, stands with a halo, wearing an orange mantle over a burgundy robe, and carrying a small basket. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that includes arches, columns, and a vaulted ceiling painted in red and gold. In the background, a building with a grey tiled roof and windows is visible. The floor is decorated with a green carpet featuring a geometric pattern.",
