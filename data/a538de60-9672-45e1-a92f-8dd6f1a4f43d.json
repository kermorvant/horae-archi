    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king, seated on a raised dais and holding a golden orb, gestures with his right hand. Before him, a kneeling woman, also crowned, receives a golden halo from an angel flying above. Another angel, also winged, stands behind the kneeling woman, with hands clasped. The scene is set against a blue sky with clouds, framed by architectural elements suggesting a canopy and curtains. The overall scene depicts a divine investiture or coronation, likely representing the Coronation of the Virgin or a similar royal saint's legend.",
