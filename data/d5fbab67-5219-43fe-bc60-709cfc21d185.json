    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures walks along a path through a hilly, green landscape. On the left, a large, rocky hill dominates the foreground. In the center, a group of three men, one in a golden robe and two in red and blue, walk together. To their right, a woman in a blue robe and white veil is accompanied by a crowned king in a golden robe and blue mantle, who gestures towards her. Behind the king, another man in a golden robe and red cap is visible. In the background, a castle or fortified settlement sits atop a hill. The scene is rendered with vibrant colors and gold leaf, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a biblical or historical event involving royalty and a procession. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific interpretation is difficult. However, the presence of a crowned king and a woman, along with other figures, suggests a narrative of importance, possibly a royal encounter, a pilgrimage, or a scene from the Old Testament.",
