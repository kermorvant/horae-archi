    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, kneels in prayer beside the Christ Child, who lies in a manger. A man, possibly Saint Joseph, also kneels in prayer. An ox and a donkey are present, with the ox looking towards the manger. Above, a structure with arches and columns is visible, from which angels descend, holding scrolls with inscriptions. The background is a vibrant green, suggesting a pastoral setting, and the entire scene is framed by decorative borders with gold leaf.",
