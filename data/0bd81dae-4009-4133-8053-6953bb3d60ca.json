    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a fortified gateway with soldiers preparing for or engaged in conflict. A lone soldier in blue armor and a helmet, carrying a halberd, runs towards the right. Within the arched entrance of a stone structure, a group of soldiers in various armor and helmets are gathered, some holding weapons. To the right, a section of a stone wall with arched openings and a tiled roof with dormer windows suggests a larger building complex. The overall impression is one of military action or defense.",
