    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded, haloed elder figure, likely a saint, stands in a rocky, sparsely vegetated landscape. He wears a hooded cloak and holds a book and a staff with a rosary hanging from it. Rays of divine light emanate from a bust of God at the apex of an arched frame, illuminating the saint. To the left, a dog with a collar and a small object in its mouth looks up at the saint. To the right, a small, indistinct white object, possibly a bird or another animal, is visible. The scene is framed by an ornamental border with foliate motifs.",
