    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, identified by his halo as a saint, seated on a raised platform. He is dressed in a blue robe and holds a scroll that unfurls to reveal Latin text. To his right, a winged ox, a symbol of Saint Luke, is depicted. The background shows a brick wall with two windows, suggesting an interior setting. Above, a wooden beamed ceiling is visible, and a richly patterned tapestry hangs on the right wall. The ground is rendered in a green, scaled pattern. A book lies open on the ground in front of the saint. The text on the scroll, \"Gloria tibi,\" translates to \"Glory to you,\" and likely refers to divine glory.",
