    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, with long wavy hair and a richly decorated garment, points with their left hand towards a coiled serpent and a bird with large wings. The serpent is entwined around a small, cat-like creature. The bird appears to be a griffin, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style, with stark lines and minimal shading, suggesting a devotional or didactic purpose.",
