    "scene_description_enriched": "The upper register depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, flanked by two thieves on crosses. Christ, wearing a loincloth, is nailed to the central cross. To his left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a white veil and blue robe, kneels with hands clasped in prayer. To his right, a figure in blue and red robes, likely John the Evangelist, leans forward with head bowed. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills and a distant castle is visible under a blue sky. The lower register shows a group of figures in a garden setting. Christ, in blue robes, is seated with his head in his hands, while other figures in blue and purple robes are also seated or kneeling. A figure in a brown robe holds a lantern and looks out from a doorway. A group of soldiers, some armed, approach from the right. The scene is divided into two distinct registers, suggesting a narrative progression.",
