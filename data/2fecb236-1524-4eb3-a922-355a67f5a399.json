    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded figure with long, wavy hair, wearing a halo and a green cloak over a brown garment. The figure's hands are raised, palms outward, in a gesture of blessing or proclamation. Two eight-pointed stars are positioned above and to the sides of the figure's head. The inscription \"Omnis ...\" is partially visible below the figure. The overall style is that of a woodcut illustration with hand-coloring.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure, with its halo and gesture, is likely representing Christ. The stars could symbolize divine presence or a celestial event. The inscription, though incomplete, might be part of a devotional text or a reference to a biblical passage related to Christ's divinity or authority.",
