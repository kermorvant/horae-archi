    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, seated on a throne with a green, patterned canopy, blesses with his right hand and holds a staff in his left. He wears a jeweled mitre and ornate robes. Before him kneels a woman in a blue mantle, her hands clasped. To the left, an angel, with golden wings, presents a crown to the kneeling woman. The scene is set against an orange background, with hints of architectural elements like wooden panels and decorative borders. The overall impression is one of a significant religious or royal investiture.",
