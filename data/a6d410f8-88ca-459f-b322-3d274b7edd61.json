    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, possibly a king or a figure of authority, stands in a richly decorated robe. He wears a distinctive hat adorned with a flower-like motif. His left arm is raised, holding a whip or a similar implement, while his right hand holds a chain attached to a key. The background suggests an indoor setting with a window featuring a diamond-shaped pattern. The man's attire and the presence of keys hint at a role of governance or stewardship.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a figure associated with authority or judgment, possibly representing a king, a judge, or a steward. The keys are a common symbol of authority and responsibility, often associated with Saint Peter or a ruler entrusted with the keys to a kingdom or treasury. The whip could symbolize power or the enforcement of justice. Without further context, a specific biblical or devotional scene is not definitively identifiable, but it evokes themes of power, responsibility, and judgment.",
