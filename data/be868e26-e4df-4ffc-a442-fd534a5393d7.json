    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded men, each wearing a distinctive hat, are depicted in profile, facing each other. The man on the left wears a green, wide-brimmed hat and an orange garment. The man on the right wears a reddish-brown, rounded hat with decorative elements and a green garment. They are separated by a vertical architectural element that resembles a column or pillar, topped with a decorative element that suggests a canopy or entablature. The background is plain, with a border framing the scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a scene from the Old Testament, possibly representing two prophets, kings, or important figures engaged in dialogue or contemplation. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific biblical event cannot be definitively identified. The architectural element might symbolize a sacred space or a place of authority.",
