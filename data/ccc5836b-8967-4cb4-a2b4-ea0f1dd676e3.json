    "scene_description_enriched": "Four women are depicted in a close-up view, each wearing a veil or wimple that covers their hair and neck. Their faces are rendered with distinct features, and their expressions suggest a moment of contemplation or prayer. The figures are dressed in long robes, with some showing belted waists. The hands of two women are clasped together in prayer, while others are positioned in a gesture of supplication or contemplation. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching to indicate form and drapery. There is no architectural setting visible, suggesting the focus is entirely on the figures and their devotional state.",
