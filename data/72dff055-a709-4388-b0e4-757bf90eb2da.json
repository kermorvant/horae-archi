    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, who is shown tied to a tree, pierced by multiple arrows. His body is pale and marked with blood. Three archers, dressed in medieval attire, are actively shooting arrows at him. In the background, a city with spires and domes is visible under a blue sky. Above, in a golden halo and rays of light, a divine figure, likely God the Father, blesses the scene with a gesture of his hand and holds a globe.",
