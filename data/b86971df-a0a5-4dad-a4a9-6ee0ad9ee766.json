    "scene_description_enriched": "A sorrowful Virgin Mary, with a blue halo and wings, gently touches the arm of Christ, who is depicted with a crown of thorns and wounds from his Passion. Christ is partially draped in a white loincloth, and blood stains are visible on his body. The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting an interior or a somber setting. The scene evokes the Pieta, a devotional image of the Virgin Mary mourning over the body of Christ.",
