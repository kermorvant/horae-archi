The dove is surrounded by a vibrant, concentric halo of red and yellow, with golden rays emanating from its center. Above and to the sides, two golden hands, likely representing God the Father, are visible, with drops of liquid falling from them, possibly symbolizing divine grace or blessings. The overall composition suggests a divine presence and the descent of the Holy Spirit.",
