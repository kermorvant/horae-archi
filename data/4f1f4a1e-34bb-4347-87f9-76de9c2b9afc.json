    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, dressed in a simple white tunic and hose, is depicted inside a circular frame. He is shown in profile, bending over and using a tool consisting of two wooden sticks to thresh a bundle of grain. The grain is represented as vertical golden stalks, and scattered kernels are visible on the ground. The background is a plain, muted green, suggesting an indoor setting like a barn or threshing floor. This scene likely represents the agricultural labor associated with the month of July, a common theme in Books of Hours illustrating the labors of the months.",
