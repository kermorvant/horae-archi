    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Betrayal of Christ, with Judas Iscariot embracing Jesus, identifying him to the soldiers. Jesus, in a blue robe with a red cloak, turns towards Judas. Peter, on the right, is shown drawing a sword, his hand raised in defense or perhaps in the act of striking. In the foreground, a figure in a red tunic lies on the ground, having dropped a lantern, possibly representing a fallen soldier or an onlooker. Behind the central figures, a crowd of soldiers in armor and helmets are visible, some holding spears. In the background, a wooden structure with a roof, possibly a temporary shelter or part of a larger encampment, is erected, with more spears visible behind it.",
