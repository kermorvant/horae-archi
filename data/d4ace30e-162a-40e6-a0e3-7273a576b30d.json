    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures are depicted in an outdoor setting with stylized foliage and small insects. One figure, wearing a red hood and a pink tunic, is reaching out towards the other. The second figure, dressed in a blue tunic and cap, stands with their hands clasped in front. The ground is depicted as a green mound with some brown circular objects, possibly berries or nuts, scattered on it. The overall scene is decorative and appears to be part of a larger illuminated manuscript, likely a Book of Hours, with ornamental borders.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is not clearly identifiable as a specific biblical or devotional event. It may represent a secular scene, a moralizing tale, or a symbolic representation within the context of a Book of Hours.",
