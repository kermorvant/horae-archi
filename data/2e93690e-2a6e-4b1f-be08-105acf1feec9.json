    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint, stands holding a chalice in her left hand and a draped cloth in her right. She wears a long, flowing garment. Behind her, to the right, is a depiction of buildings with towers and arched windows, suggesting an urban or architectural setting. To the left, there are indications of other figures or elements, partially obscured, and a decorative arch frames the upper portion of the scene. The figure's gesture and the chalice are indicative of martyrdom or a saintly attribute.",
