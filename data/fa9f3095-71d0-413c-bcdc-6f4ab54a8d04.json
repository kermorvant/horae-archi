    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body marked by wounds. A banner with the inscription \"INRI\" is above his head. To the left of the cross stands the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue and red, with a halo. To the right, another figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also with a halo, gazes towards Christ. The figures are set against a background of a red grid pattern with darker circular motifs, suggesting a stylized representation of a wall or tapestry. The ground is rendered with green foliage and brown earth.",
