    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue mantle, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child wrapped in white. Saint Joseph, wearing a red cap and cloak over a golden tunic, leads the donkey by a rope, carrying a staff with a bag slung over his shoulder. They are in a lush green landscape with trees and flowering plants. In the background, a town with spires and buildings is visible under a starry night sky. Several figures on horseback and on foot are also present in the distance, suggesting a larger entourage or the ongoing journey.",
