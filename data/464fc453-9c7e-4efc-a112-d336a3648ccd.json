    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a skeletal figure, likely Death, holding a scythe, standing on the left. In the center, a person is falling from a tower-like structure, while another person is being pulled upwards from a body of water or a pit below. The architectural element suggests a fortified structure with battlements. The overall imagery conveys a sense of mortality and the inescapable nature of death, possibly representing the transience of life or the judgment of souls.",
