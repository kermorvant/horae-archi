    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her blue mantle and halo, meeting Elizabeth, who is shown with clasped hands and a halo, indicating her piety. Behind Mary stands an older man with a beard, possibly Joseph, observing the encounter. The figures are set against a backdrop of rolling green hills and a distant cityscape with towers. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded architectural border, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
