    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely a bishop or king, wearing a crown and a bishop's miter, adorned with a rich red cloak over a green tunic. He holds a globe in his left hand and raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing or authority. Before him kneels a woman in a blue robe, her hands clasped in prayer or supplication. To her left, an angel with green wings and a white robe holds a crown, seemingly offering it to the kneeling woman. The background is a deep blue, decorated with golden flame-like motifs and architectural elements suggesting a throne room or a sacred space. The overall composition suggests a divine or royal investiture or a moment of spiritual significance.",
