    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within an open-sided pavilion supported by columns. The Virgin Mary, dressed in dark robes, kneels to the left, gazing down at the Christ Child lying on the ground. To the right, a bearded man, likely Joseph, wearing a hooded garment, leans forward and appears to be holding a small object, possibly for the child. The background shows a walled garden with sparse vegetation and trees. The pavilion's roof is thatched, and the structure is framed by decorative borders.",
