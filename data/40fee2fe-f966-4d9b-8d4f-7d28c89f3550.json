    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and beard, interacting with a kneeling figure. Christ is gesturing with his right hand, while his left hand is placed over his chest. The kneeling figure, possibly a woman based on her attire and head covering, is looking up at Christ with hands clasped in supplication. Behind Christ, two other figures are visible, one with a beard and wearing a head covering, and another partially obscured. The background suggests an architectural setting with an arched opening and decorative elements, possibly representing a doorway or a niche within a building. The overall composition suggests a moment of healing or intercession.",
