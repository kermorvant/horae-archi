    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central, veiled woman. The figures on the left and right are gesturing towards the central figure, some with hands raised in supplication or awe. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a rocky, uneven terrain suggested in the background. Above the figures, a stylized representation of clouds or divine light is visible. The central woman, draped in a veil, is the focal point of the gathering. The overall composition suggests a moment of revelation or significant spiritual encounter.",
