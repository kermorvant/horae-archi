    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and showing wounds, standing in a sarcophagus-like structure. He is partially draped in a white loincloth. To his left, a figure in a red robe kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Above Christ's head, a golden halo signifies his divinity. To Christ's left, a green bundle of twigs, possibly representing a scourge, hangs. To his right, he holds a golden staff. The background is a vibrant blue, speckled with white, suggesting a celestial or symbolic space. The foreground features a reddish-orange structure, possibly a tomb or altar, with a black shield bearing crossed yellow elements resting on it. The overall composition is stylized and symbolic, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
