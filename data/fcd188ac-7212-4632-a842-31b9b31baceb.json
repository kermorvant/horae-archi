    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a decorative border featuring several grotesque figures. On the left, a man with a beard and a hooded garment looks to the right. Next to him, a creature with pointed ears and an open mouth, possibly a demon or imp, is centrally placed. Its expression is one of distress or surprise. To its right, a hand points outwards, and further to the right, another figure, possibly a beast or a grotesque face, is visible with circular markings on its head. The overall style suggests a woodcut illustration, likely used as a decorative element in a manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional event. Instead, it appears to be a decorative border, possibly featuring grotesque figures or demons, which were common in medieval manuscripts for their symbolic or ornamental value, sometimes representing the forces of evil or chaos surrounding sacred texts.",
