    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue robe and a grey hat over a white veil, rides a donkey. She cradles the Christ Child, who is swaddled and appears to be sleeping. Joseph, dressed in a blue tunic, red hose, and a red turban, walks beside the donkey, leading it by a rope and carrying a staff over his shoulder. The landscape is rolling and green, with trees and a winding path. In the background, a fortified city with towers and spires is visible on a hill, suggesting their destination or a place of refuge. The overall impression is one of a humble and arduous journey.",
