    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a landscape setting. On the left, a person wearing a white habit and a grey hood holds open a red-bound book. This figure has a halo, indicating sainthood. On the right, a figure dressed in episcopal vestments, including a mitre and a red cope, holds a crosier. This figure also has a halo. The background features stylized trees with red fruit on the left and right, and a blue, somewhat abstract landscape with distant, pointed structures in the center. The overall impression is a devotional scene, possibly illustrating an encounter between two saints.",
