    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an architectural setting. In the foreground, a man with a long beard and wearing a red robe and a grey tunic is gesturing with his hands, which are clasped together. He is surrounded by other men, some wearing blue hoods. To the right, a figure in a yellow garment and a blue hat points with their index finger. Behind the figures, architectural elements are visible, including columns and a white entablature with decorative elements. The overall impression is one of a narrative scene, possibly from a biblical or devotional text, with figures engaged in dialogue or contemplation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a moment of accusation or judgment, possibly related to a biblical narrative. The pointing gesture and the concerned expressions of the figures suggest a moment of discourse or a trial. Without further context, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of justice, sin, or divine judgment.",
