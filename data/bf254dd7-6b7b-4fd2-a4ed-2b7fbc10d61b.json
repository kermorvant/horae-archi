    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a richly decorated architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, clad in a red robe and green tunic, kneels and presents a scroll to the Virgin Mary. The scroll bears the inscription \"Ave gratia plena dominus tecum.\" A lily, symbolizing purity, stands in a vase between them. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle, kneels on the right, her hands clasped in prayer, with a halo around her head. Behind her, a bookshelf filled with books suggests a domestic or scholarly environment. Sunlight streams through an open window, illuminating a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, flying into the room. To the far left, a walled garden or courtyard is visible through an arched opening, with a figure in the upper left corner, possibly God the Father, observing the scene. The overall composition is framed by ornate architectural elements, including columns and decorative friezes.",
