    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child. She is dressed in a red tunic and a blue mantle adorned with gold. Beside her, a bearded man, presumably Saint Joseph, walks alongside the donkey. He wears a red robe with gold embellishments and blue hose, carrying a staff over his shoulder with a bag attached, and holding a lantern in his right hand. The background features a hilly landscape with trees and a distant walled city. The overall scene suggests a pilgrimage or flight, likely the Flight into Egypt.",
