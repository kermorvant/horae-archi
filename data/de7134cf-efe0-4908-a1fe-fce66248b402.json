    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her halo and blue undergarment, embracing Saint Elizabeth. Mary wears a red robe and a white veil, while Elizabeth is dressed in a golden patterned robe and a blue hat. They stand in front of a stone structure, possibly a city wall or building, with a castle and other buildings visible in the background under a golden sky. The figures are rendered with a focus on their emotional connection, with their faces close and their arms around each other.",
