In her right hand, she holds a golden chalice from which a small bird emerges, symbolizing the legend of Saint John the Evangelist being given a poisoned chalice from which a bird flew out, rendering the poison harmless. The background depicts rolling green hills, distant mountains, and a stylized building with a tower and arched windows. The sky is a pale blue with some clouds.",
