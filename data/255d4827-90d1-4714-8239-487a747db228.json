    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine intervention or judgment. Three figures with multiple heads, adorned in blue robes with gold trim, stand in the foreground. One figure, with three heads, gestures outwards. Below them, two figures lie prostrate on a green, grassy ground, one in red and the other in blue. A kneeling figure in blue, with a white beard, prays with hands clasped. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of blue, red, and gold squares, from which golden rays descend, suggesting a celestial or divine presence. The overall impression is one of awe and submission before a powerful, possibly divine, force.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of divine judgment or revelation, possibly related to the Old Testament, where figures are struck down or humbled by God's power. The multiple heads could symbolize omniscience or a composite divine entity. The prostrate figures represent those subjected to this divine power, while the praying figure seeks intercession or mercy. The golden rays are a common motif for divine light or presence.",
