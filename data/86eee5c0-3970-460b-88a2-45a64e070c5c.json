    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer within an architectural setting. She is adorned in a golden dress and a blue mantle, with her hands crossed over her chest and a halo around her head. To her left, a lily plant symbolizes her purity. Behind her, an open book rests on a richly decorated lectern, suggesting her devotion and study. The background features architectural elements, including arched windows and a vaulted ceiling, rendered in gold and blue with star motifs. To the far left, a figure, possibly a prophet or an angel, is partially visible, looking down and holding a scroll. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends towards the Virgin. The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet contemplation and divine presence.",
