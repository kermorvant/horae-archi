    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, meeting Elizabeth, who is kneeling and wearing a red and purple garment. Both figures have golden halos, indicating their sanctity. They are shown outdoors in a landscape with rolling green hills and a winding path. In the background, a fortified building with towers and battlements is visible, along with smaller structures and distant mountains. The scene is framed by an ornate golden arch, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
