    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded king, seated on a throne draped in red and gold fabric, holds a scepter. He wears a blue and gold patterned hat. At his feet, a dark-skinned figure kneels. To the right, a crowned figure in blue kneels and offers a chalice to a group of men in orange and blue robes. The scene takes place within an architectural setting, suggested by a vaulted ceiling and an arched doorway in the background, which opens to a relief depicting a battle or procession. The overall impression is one of royal audience or presentation, possibly with a religious undertone due to the chalice.",
