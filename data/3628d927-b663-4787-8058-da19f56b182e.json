    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo, stands in a landscape. She is depicted in a three-quarter profile, looking to her left. She wears a grey undergarment with gold trim on the sleeves and a rich red cloak lined with gold fabric. In her left hand, she holds a golden chalice. The background features rolling green hills, a stylized tree on the right, and distant blue mountains with architectural structures, suggesting a serene, possibly idealized, setting. The overall impression is one of piety and sanctity.",
