    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts agricultural labor in a field, likely representing the month of August. Three figures are engaged in harvesting or gathering wheat. One figure, standing under a wooden structure that suggests a barn or shelter, is partially visible, holding a bundle of wheat. Another figure, in the center, uses a tool to gather the stalks. A third figure, kneeling on the right, is also working with the harvested wheat. Above the field, a blue sky with stylized birds is depicted. To the right of the figures, a page from a Book of Hours displays text in Latin, with decorative initial letters and gold leaf, indicating the liturgical context of the image.",
