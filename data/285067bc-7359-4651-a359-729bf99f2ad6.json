    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and cope, stands to the left, holding a crozier and gesturing with his right hand. He is positioned in what appears to be an interior space with a tiled floor and a draped curtain behind him. To the right, three nude children are depicted in a large wooden tub, their hands clasped in prayer or supplication. Behind the children, through an opening framed by columns, a landscape with rolling hills and trees is visible under a cloudy sky. The scene likely represents a narrative from a saint's life or a devotional allegory, possibly involving a miracle or a plea for divine intervention.",
