The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and halo, rides a brown horse, holding the Christ Child. The Child is also depicted with a halo. To the right, a man, possibly Joseph, rides another horse, dressed in a red cloak and a wide-brimmed hat. Behind them, a group of figures, some on horseback, are visible, suggesting a retinue or escort. In the background, a fortified city with red walls and towers is depicted under a blue sky with stylized clouds. The landscape is rendered with green and brown tones, indicating a journey through varied terrain.",
