Two older men, one in blue and the other in pink, are actively assisting in the process, holding the boy. Other men stand by, observing the event. Above them, a stylized representation of the heavens is shown with golden rays emanating from a blue sky dotted with clouds, falling upon a patterned background of red and blue squares.
