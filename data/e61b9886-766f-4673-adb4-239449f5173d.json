    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bearded man with a long, wavy beard and hair, wearing a patterned tunic and a distinctive hat. He is shown in profile, looking upwards and to the right. He holds a harp with his left hand, and his right hand is extended towards it, suggesting he is playing or about to play. Above and to his right, a star-like symbol is visible. The overall scene is rendered in a woodcut style with bold outlines and hatching for shading. The figure's attire and the presence of the harp strongly suggest the biblical King David.",
