    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure lying down, possibly in distress or contemplation, with hands clasped. Above this figure, an animal head with horns is visible, suggesting a pastoral or possibly symbolic setting. Below the reclining figure, a quadrupedal creature with a tail and sharp features, possibly a demon or a wild animal, is depicted. The background is textured, with some foliage suggested. This scene is likely an allegorical representation of a spiritual struggle or temptation, possibly related to the Passion of Christ or a saint's trial.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is interpreted as a representation of Christ's Agony in the Garden, where he was tempted by demons before his crucifixion. The reclining figure could be Christ, and the lower creature a demon or personification of temptation. The animal head above might represent the presence of divine or angelic beings, or perhaps the suffering of the animals in the garden.",
