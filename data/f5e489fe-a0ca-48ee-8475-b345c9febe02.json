A seated figure, likely God the Father or Christ, wearing a bishop's mitre and a red robe with a blue mantle, places a golden crown upon the head of the kneeling Virgin Mary. She is dressed in a blue robe and kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. To her left, an angel in a golden robe with white wings stands with hands clasped. Above them, two smaller angels with halos and golden robes are depicted in prayer. The figures are set against a backdrop of ornate, patterned drapery and architectural elements, suggesting a heavenly or royal setting.",
