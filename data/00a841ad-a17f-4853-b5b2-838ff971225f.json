    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a solitary, emaciated figure, likely Christ, seated with hands clasped in prayer and a halo of golden rays. He is surrounded by three dark, demonic figures, two of whom are actively tormenting him with sticks. The setting is a barren landscape with dry, golden stalks and a blue sky. This imagery represents the Temptation of Christ in the wilderness, a period of spiritual trial and suffering before his public ministry.",
