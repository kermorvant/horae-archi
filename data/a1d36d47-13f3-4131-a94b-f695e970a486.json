    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition from the Cross. Christ, with a halo, is being lowered from a wooden cross. A man in an orange robe, standing on a ladder, is carefully supporting Christ's body, while another figure in a blue robe, also on a ladder, holds Christ's legs. Below, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle and hood, looks upwards with sorrow. The background features a lush green landscape with trees and a distant view of a walled city with towers and spires. The sky is a deep blue, dotted with golden stars, and a plaque with the inscription 'INRI' is visible on the cross.",
