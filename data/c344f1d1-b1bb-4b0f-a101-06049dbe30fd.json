    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men are depicted in what appears to be an interior setting, possibly a hall or chamber. In the foreground, a kneeling figure with wavy hair presents a scroll to a seated figure wearing a crown and ornate robes. The seated figure, with a long beard, points to the scroll. Behind them, two other men, also bearded and wearing hats, are visible, one pointing forward. The architectural elements suggest a formal space, with decorative framing and what might be columns or pilasters in the background. The scene likely depicts a moment of presentation or decree, possibly related to a royal or religious authority.",
