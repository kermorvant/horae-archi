    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated, holding the Christ Child who is reaching towards her face. To the left, an angel with wings kneels and plays a portative organ. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that appears to be a room, suggested by the patterned walls and a draped canopy above. The overall composition is framed by an ornamental arch, hinting at a manuscript illumination.",
