    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flight into Egypt, with the Virgin Mary riding a donkey, holding the Christ Child. An angel accompanies them on the left, and Saint Joseph walks beside the donkey on the right, leading it. In the background, a group of figures on horseback are seen on a hillside, suggesting pursuit. Above, a stylized sun radiates light, and in the far distance, a blue, mountainous landscape with hints of architecture is visible. A golden column with a figure reaching out from it is depicted on a hill to the left, possibly representing a pagan idol toppled by the Holy Family's passage.",
