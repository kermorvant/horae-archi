    "scene_description_enriched": "A young man, depicted with a halo of golden rays emanating from behind his head, stands in a grassy landscape. He is dressed in blue armor and a white cloak, holding a sword in his right hand and a small, dark object, possibly a book or reliquary, in his left. A lamb lies peacefully at his feet, and a small, brown creature with a branch is visible to the right. The background features stylized mountains and a red, gold-patterned semi-circle, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
