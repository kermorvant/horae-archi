To her right stands a man in a blue hooded robe and a black hat, holding a rope attached to the donkey. Behind them, a large, multi-turreted building with pointed roofs and tall, narrow windows dominates the left side of the scene. In the background, rolling green hills are visible under a pale blue sky. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
