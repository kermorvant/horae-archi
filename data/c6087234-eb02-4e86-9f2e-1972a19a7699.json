    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural setting framed by a pointed arch. On the left, a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is seated, her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a blue mantle over a red tunic. She has a halo. On the right, a man, possibly Saint Joseph, stands, holding an open book and placing his hand on the woman's head. He also has a halo. The background is a golden, diamond-patterned tapestry. Flanking the figures are two architectural elements resembling miniature towers or candelabra, with red bases and shafts, topped by conical roofs and crosses. The overall composition suggests a religious narrative within a stylized, possibly divine, space.",
