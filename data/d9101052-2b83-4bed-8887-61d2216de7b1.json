    "scene_description_enriched": "A choir of seven angels is depicted, each with large, colorful wings (blue, red, and green). They are dressed in pink tunics with white undersleeves and some wear green or red caps. The angels are engaged in playing musical instruments: four are playing flutes or recorders, and one in the center is playing a lute. The background is a flat, golden hue, suggesting a celestial or divine setting. The overall impression is one of heavenly music and praise.",
