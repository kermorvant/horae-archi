The scene takes place indoors, within a room characterized by architectural elements suggesting a classical or Renaissance style, with fluted columns and decorative friezes. A lectern with an open book stands behind the saint, and a richly carved wooden structure is visible to his left. The floor is tiled with blue and brown patterns.",
