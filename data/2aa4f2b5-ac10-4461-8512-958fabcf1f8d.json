The angel wears a blue robe over a white garment and has reddish-brown hair styled in curls. The background is decorated with a delicate pattern of scrolling vines bearing green leaves and small, dark seed pods, with a pink thistle-like flower visible on the left. The scene is rendered in a flat, illustrative style typical of medieval manuscripts.",
