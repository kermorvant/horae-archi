    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, flowing blonde hair, dressed in a rose-colored robe, is depicted kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer. She is seated on the back of a dark, quadrupedal creature with long ears and a tail, rendered with gold highlights. The scene unfolds in a verdant landscape with rolling hills, scattered trees, and a rocky outcrop on the left. In the background, a body of water is visible, beyond which lies a fortified city with towers and walls. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene set in a pastoral environment with a distant urban settlement.",
