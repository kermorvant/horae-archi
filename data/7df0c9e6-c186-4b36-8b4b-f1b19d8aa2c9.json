    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a confrontation between a demonic figure and a robed man. The demon, with a grotesque face, pointed ears, and clawed hands, is positioned on the left, appearing to hold something or gesture towards the man. The man, on the right, wears a cap and a long robe, his hands clasped in front of him. Behind the figures, architectural elements suggest an interior setting, possibly a hall or chamber, with arches and shadowed forms. The overall impression is one of spiritual struggle or temptation.",
