    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within an arched architectural frame. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is seated and holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child is reaching out. Before them, one of the Magi kneels, offering a gift, while two other Magi stand behind him, one also holding a gift. The background is dark and suggests an interior space with architectural elements like columns and arches, though they are rendered abstractly. The overall scene is framed by a decorative border with floral motifs.",
