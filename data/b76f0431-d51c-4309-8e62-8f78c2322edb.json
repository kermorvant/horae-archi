    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, crowned and with a halo, is seated and cradles the Christ Child on her lap. She wears a rich blue robe adorned with gold embroidery. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is dressed in gold and reaches out to take a flower from his mother's hand. The scene is set outdoors, with a rocky landscape and trees in the background, under a blue sky with scattered clouds. To the right, a golden, ornate structure resembling a small altar or tabernacle is visible. Behind the figures, a decorative parapet with circular medallions depicting figures in prayer or contemplation separates the immediate foreground from the landscape.",
