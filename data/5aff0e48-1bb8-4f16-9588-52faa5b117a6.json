    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and bleeding, being presented to a crowd. He is clad in a purple cloak and a loincloth, with his hands bound. He bears the marks of scourging on his body. He is led by a figure in a blue robe and a distinctive red and white hat, holding a spear. Behind Christ, several other figures are visible, some looking on with somber expressions. The background suggests an architectural setting with arches and decorative elements, possibly a palace or a hall of judgment. The inscription \"ECCE HOMO\" (Behold the Man) is prominently displayed, identifying the moment of Christ's presentation to the people before his crucifixion.",
