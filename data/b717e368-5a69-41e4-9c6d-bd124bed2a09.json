The chair is ornate, with gold detailing and a blue fabric backdrop adorned with fleur-de-lis. To his left, a golden lectern holds another book. The background features a blue wall with arched decorative elements and a tiled floor. Two small, furry, monkey-like creatures are visible, one on the armrest of the chair and another standing to the right. The scene is framed by an arched border with gold embellishments.",
