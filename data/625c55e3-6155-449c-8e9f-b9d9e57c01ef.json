    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three men in a pastoral landscape. The man on the left, dressed in a red robe and hood, looks upwards with his hand raised in supplication. The central figure, wearing a brown tunic and a patterned cap, holds two staffs and gazes upwards. The man on the right, in a blue tunic and red cap, also looks upwards with a pensive expression. A small dog rests on the ground in the foreground. In the background, rolling hills are dotted with trees, and a river or body of water is visible. Further in the distance, a fortified castle with towers and battlements sits atop a hill, and another, more abstract architectural structure is seen on the horizon. Above, an angel with wings outstretched holds a scroll, radiating light, suggesting a divine message or intervention.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of divine revelation or prayer, possibly related to a biblical narrative or a saint's life. The upward gaze of the figures, the presence of the angel with a scroll, and the distant castle could symbolize a divine calling, a prophecy, or a plea for divine assistance. The pastoral setting and the presence of a dog might allude to shepherds or a humble setting for a spiritual event.",
