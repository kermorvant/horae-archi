    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded figure, likely God, with a golden halo, stands on a grassy ground. He wears a blue robe adorned with gold patterns and a golden cloak. His right hand is raised, pointing towards a celestial sphere. The sphere is depicted as half dark and half blue, studded with stars, and rays of light emanate from the upper right corner, directed towards it. A long, white, serpentine creature coils around the figure's legs and extends across the lower part of the scene. The background is a rich red tapestry with scattered gold and green motifs, possibly representing clouds or celestial phenomena.",
