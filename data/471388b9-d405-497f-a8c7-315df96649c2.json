    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child who is also haloed and dressed in red. A woman in a pink dress, carrying a basket filled with white loaves, walks beside the donkey. To the right, a man in a red robe and blue hood, possibly a guide or a pilgrim, walks ahead, holding the donkey's reins. In the background, rolling green hills are dotted with trees, and a distant cityscape with towers and spires is visible under a blue sky. The overall impression is one of travel through a pastoral landscape towards a settlement.",
