    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures within an architectural framework suggesting a loggia or arcade. On the left, a tonsured man in a white habit, holding a scroll, extends his hand towards a kneeling figure dressed in blue and red. This kneeling figure holds a hat and appears to be receiving something from the man in white. To the right, another tonsured man, this one in a dark habit, stands holding a book and a crozier, indicating he is a bishop or abbot. The background features a rich tapestry-like pattern of red and gold, with a blue sky dotted with stars visible above. The overall setting is outdoors, with a green ground plane.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a saintly encounter, possibly a bishop or abbot receiving a supplicant or a devotee. The white-robed figure could be a saint known for charity or intercession, while the kneeling figure represents a person seeking spiritual or material aid. The presence of the book and crozier on the right figure strongly suggests a religious authority figure, perhaps Saint Benedict or another prominent monastic leader.",
