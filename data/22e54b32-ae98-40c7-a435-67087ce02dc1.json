    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, scourged and bleeding, standing behind a pink, sarcophagus-like structure. His hands are bound, and a wound is visible on his side. Before the structure, three figures are shown in prayer. The foremost figure, dressed in a green and gold chasuble, is a cleric with tonsured hair, his hands clasped in supplication. Behind him are two other figures, one wearing a red hat. In the background, a ladder leans against a wall, and a man with a beard is seen pouring liquid from a jug into a dish. A lantern hangs from the ceiling.",
