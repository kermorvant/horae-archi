    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures stand against a decorative gold and red patterned background. The figure on the left, dressed in an orange robe over a blue garment, holds a green book and a processional cross with a staff. He has a beard and a halo. The figure on the right, clad in a blue robe with pink trim, holds a cluster of stones in his hands and also has a beard and a halo. The floor is tiled in a green and black checkered pattern. The scene appears to be set within an architectural space, suggested by a grey wall or structure behind the figures.",
