    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central figure identified as Christ, who is gesturing with his right hand. To Christ's left, a woman with long hair is looking towards him, her hands clasped in front of her. To Christ's right, a man kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. Behind Christ and the woman are several other figures, some wearing helmets, suggesting a crowd or possibly soldiers. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative carving, suggesting an interior or a structured setting. The overall composition suggests a moment of teaching, healing, or divine interaction.",
