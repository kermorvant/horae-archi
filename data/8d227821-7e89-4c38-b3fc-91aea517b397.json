He wears a blue robe adorned with gold fleur-de-lis and a red and gold trim. A harp rests at his feet. Above him, in the sky, a depiction of the Virgin Mary is visible within a starry blue circle. The background on the left features rolling hills, trees, rocky outcrops, and a distant city with spires. On the right, a group of figures stands in an architectural setting, possibly an entrance or doorway. One figure, identified as 'Saul', is on the far right, wearing a royal blue robe and a crown. He is speaking to or gesturing towards a group of three men. The central figure in this group wears a blue tunic with gold trim and a pointed hat, holding a sword. Another figure beside him wears a red tunic and a similar hat, holding a spear. The third figure is in a green tunic. The architecture on the right consists of a pink wall with windows featuring diamond-shaped tracery.",
