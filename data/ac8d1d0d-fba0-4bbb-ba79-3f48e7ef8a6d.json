    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, with the Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue, riding a donkey and holding the Christ Child, who is dressed in red. To the right, a bearded man, presumably Saint Joseph, walks alongside, carrying a red bundle over his shoulder. The figures are set against a vibrant, textured gold background, suggesting a divine or ethereal setting, with a patch of green ground indicating their path. The composition is framed by a decorative border.",
