    "scene_description_enriched": "An elderly, emaciated man with a long white beard lies on a bed, covered by a white sheet. His arms are crossed over his chest, and his body appears frail. Three men stand over him, two in the foreground and one in the background. The two foreground figures are dressed in elaborate white robes with decorative collars and wear head coverings. The man on the left gestures towards the reclining figure, while the man on the right clasps his hands in prayer or supplication. The background is a rich, patterned gold textile. In the foreground, scattered bones are visible, suggesting a scene of illness, death, or perhaps resurrection.",
