    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a wooden cross, adorned with a crown of thorns, standing in a rocky, mountainous landscape under a pale blue sky. The inscription \"INRI\" is visible on a plaque at the top of the cross. Three nails are depicted, one piercing the right hand of Christ (implied), another the left hand, and a third the feet. The base of the cross is planted in the ground, with sparse vegetation and rocks. The overall impression is one of solemnity and the stark depiction of the Crucifixion.",
