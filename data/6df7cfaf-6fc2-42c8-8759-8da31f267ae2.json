    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some with beards and wearing blue and red tunics, look upwards with expressions of awe and distress. One man in a pink tunic kneels and holds a blood-stained golden cloth. To the right, a figure, likely an elder or prophet, with a long white beard and wearing a blue and gold robe, raises his hand towards the sky. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of red, blue, and gold squares. The scene is set on a green, grassy ground.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the story of the Levite's concubine from the Book of Judges (Judges 19-21). The blood-stained cloth could represent the torn garment of the concubine, stained with blood after her ordeal. The men looking up in distress and the elder figure raising his hand suggest a moment of lamentation, divine intervention, or a call to action in response to a grave injustice.",
