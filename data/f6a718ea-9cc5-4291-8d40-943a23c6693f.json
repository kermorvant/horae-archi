    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned man, identified as King David, kneels in prayer in a verdant, hilly landscape. He wears a royal robe of red over a blue tunic, with a decorative belt. His hands are clasped in supplication, and his gaze is directed upwards. To his left stands a harp, and to his right, a lute rests on the ground next to an open book displaying text. In the background, a river flows towards a city with prominent towers and spires, and above, a divine presence is depicted within a cloud, radiating light. The scene likely represents King David in prayer, possibly composing psalms or seeking divine guidance, with musical instruments and scripture symbolizing his devotion and artistic talents.",
