    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a regal figure, likely a bishop or king, seated on a golden throne, gesturing with his right hand and holding a small object in his left. Before him, a woman, identified by her kneeling posture and prayerful hands as the Virgin Mary, is shown with a halo. Above them, two winged figures, possibly angels, are presenting a golden crown. The background features a rich tapestry with floral motifs and a blue cloth adorned with fleur-de-lis. The overall setting suggests a divine or royal audience.",
