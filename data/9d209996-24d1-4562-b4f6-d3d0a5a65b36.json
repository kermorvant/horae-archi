    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a decorative border featuring stylized floral elements. On the left, a fan-shaped bloom with radiating lines is visible. To its right, a pomegranate fruit, split open to reveal seeds, is depicted on a stem with leaves. A small, abstract floral motif hovers above the stem. Further to the right, another stylized flower with pointed petals emerges from the lower border. The overall composition is a decorative arrangement of botanical motifs, likely intended as an ornamental element within a manuscript.",
