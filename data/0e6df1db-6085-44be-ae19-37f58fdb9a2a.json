    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two main areas, viewed through an architectural archway. The foreground depicts a woman, identified as Mary Magdalene, kneeling and anointing the feet of Christ, who is seated at a table with other figures. She is wiping his feet with her hair. To the left, a man in a pink robe stands, holding a purse, and looking towards the scene. Behind Christ, a group of men are seated at a table, some eating. The background, viewed through a separate archway, shows a landscape with a figure praying in a field, a red dragon flying above, and a group of people behind a wooden fence. This outer scene may represent a temptation or a spiritual struggle. The interior scene is richly decorated with a tiled floor and wooden beams supporting the ceiling.",
