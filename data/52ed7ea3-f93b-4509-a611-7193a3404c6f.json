    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in a mitre and rich vestments, stands in an interior space with a stone-block wall. He holds a crozier in his right hand and extends his left hand, wearing a ring, towards two unclothed children who are looking up at him with hopeful expressions. Behind the bishop, a window reveals a pastoral landscape. The scene likely depicts a bishop performing an act of charity or blessing, possibly related to the legend of Saint Nicholas, who is often associated with protecting children and providing dowries.",
