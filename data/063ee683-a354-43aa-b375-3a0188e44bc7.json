    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ's body, pale and limp, is being lowered by two figures standing on ladders. One figure, dressed in a red robe, holds Christ's arm, while another, in a blue robe and yellow head covering, appears to be supporting his legs or torso. Below, a group of mourners gazes upwards. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, flanked by other figures. To the right, a woman in a pink gown also kneels, reaching towards Christ's wound. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling green hills, scattered trees, and rocky outcrops. The cross itself is a simple wooden structure.",
