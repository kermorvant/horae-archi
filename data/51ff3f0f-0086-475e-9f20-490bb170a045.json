    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a distinctive hat adorned with a circular element and a small knob. He is dressed in a tunic with a high collar and a row of circular buttons down the front. His right hand is raised, with fingers extended in a gesture of speech or blessing, while his left hand rests on his lap. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a textured surface or perhaps a stylized representation of foliage. Above the figure, an architectural element resembling a decorative archway or canopy is visible, featuring intricate scrollwork and floral motifs. The overall style is that of a woodcut or wood engraving, common in medieval and early Renaissance printed books.",
