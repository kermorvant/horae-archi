    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, presumably Christ, stands on the left, gesturing with his right hand towards a group of attentive listeners. The listeners, depicted with varied expressions of awe and contemplation, are gathered in a semi-circle, looking upwards at the speaker. To the right, a stylized architectural structure resembling a tower or gatehouse with crenellations and small windows is visible. The background is filled with a pattern of small squares, suggesting a decorative or symbolic element rather than a realistic setting. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
