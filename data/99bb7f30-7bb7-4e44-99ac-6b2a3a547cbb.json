    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape within a circular frame, bordered by blue decorative elements. On the left, a group of deer, one with prominent antlers, are gathered. To the right, a lion with a human-like face and a thick mane is seated. The background features rolling hills, sparse trees, and a path or stream running through the center. The overall impression is one of a natural setting where wild animals are present. This imagery is likely symbolic, possibly representing the \"Lion of Judah\" or a similar allegorical figure from religious or bestiary traditions.",
