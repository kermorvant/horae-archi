    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures, identified as saints by their halos, are depicted standing. The figure on the left wears a blue robe over a lighter garment adorned with floral motifs and holds a book and a staff. The figure on the right wears a blue robe and holds a book. Both figures have beards and are depicted within an architectural setting suggested by decorative elements that resemble canopies and spires, rendered with gold leaf and intricate patterns. The background features a diamond-shaped pattern in gold, blue, and red, with smaller decorative motifs. The overall impression is one of solemnity and religious devotion, likely representing apostles or other significant biblical figures.",
