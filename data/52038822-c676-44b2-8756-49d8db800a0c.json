    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Catherine of Alexandria, identifiable by her crown and halo, holding a sword and standing next to a broken wheel, her attribute. She is dressed in a golden robe over a blue tunic. To her left and right, two figures in monastic habits pull back a decorative tapestry, revealing the central figure. At the bottom right, a kneeling figure in blue and white robes, also crowned, prays to Saint Catherine. The background is a patterned tapestry of pink with floral motifs. The overall setting appears to be a stage-like presentation, possibly within a manuscript illumination.",
