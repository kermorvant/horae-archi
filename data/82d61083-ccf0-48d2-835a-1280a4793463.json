    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ in the center, with a halo, raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing or teaching. He is draped in a dark robe. Two figures, possibly angels, are positioned on either side of Christ's head, reaching towards him. Below Christ, several figures are depicted emerging from what appears to be the ground or water, some with hands clasped in prayer. The overall setting is somewhat abstract, with a dark, textured background and hints of foliage or organic forms. The upper border features decorative elements, possibly floral or foliate motifs.",
