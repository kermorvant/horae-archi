    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer, her hands clasped, before the Christ Child lying in a manger. Joseph, with a beard and wearing a blue cloak over a red tunic, stands behind Mary, his hand touching his face in contemplation. The setting appears to be a stable, indicated by the wooden structure with a thatched roof. A dog lies on the ground to the right. The background shows a stylized landscape with trees and hills, and a patterned window or screen is visible behind the figures, suggesting an interior or a sheltered view.",
