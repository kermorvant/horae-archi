    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in a landscape setting. The woman on the left, dressed in a blue robe, stands with her head bowed and her hands clasped. The woman on the right, wearing a red robe and a white veil, reaches out to touch the other woman's abdomen. Behind them, a stylized tree with green foliage grows from a rocky, brown mound. The background is a dark, patterned textile, suggesting an interior or a symbolic space, framed by decorative borders. The scene is interpreted as the Visitation, where Mary, pregnant with Christ, visits her cousin Elizabeth, who is also pregnant.",
