    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely female, kneels in a green landscape. She wears a blue tunic and an orange mantle. Her face is obscured by damage to the manuscript. In front of her, a large bird, possibly a falcon or eagle, is perched on her hand, which is extended towards it. In the background, a blue sky with a reddish-orange orb (perhaps the sun or moon) is visible above a distant cityscape with buildings and a tower. The overall scene suggests a moment of interaction between the kneeling figure and the bird, set against a stylized landscape and urban background.",
