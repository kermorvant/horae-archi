    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, with a halo around her head. She is approached by a bearded man who is kneeling and clasping his hands in supplication. Behind the kneeling man, other figures are visible, including one with a distinctive hairstyle. In the background, architectural elements suggest a building with a rounded arch and a decorative pinnacle. Above and behind the figures, a dynamic scene unfolds with a figure falling from a column, possibly representing a miracle or a symbolic event. The overall setting appears to be a partially enclosed or outdoor space with architectural features.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a devotional image, possibly depicting a miracle attributed to the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child, or a scene from their lives. The kneeling figure's gesture suggests prayer or petition. The falling figure in the background could symbolize the triumph of faith over adversity or a specific biblical narrative, though without further context, its exact meaning is open to interpretation. Given the presence of the Virgin and Child and a supplicant, it could also allude to the Presentation in the Temple or a similar event where divine intervention is sought.",
