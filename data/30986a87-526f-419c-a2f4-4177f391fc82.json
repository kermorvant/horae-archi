    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a simple stable structure. A newborn Christ Child lies in a manger, radiating a golden halo. To the left, the Virgin Mary kneels in prayer, her hands clasped. To the right, Saint Joseph, leaning on a staff, also appears to be in prayer or contemplation. In the background, within the stable, are the figures of an ox and a donkey. The architecture is rudimentary, suggesting a humble setting for the birth of Christ. The overall impression is one of quiet reverence and divine humility.",
