    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered in prayer under a golden archway. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, draped in a blue mantle over a pink gown. To her right, an older man with a beard, likely Saint Peter, also prays. Behind them, several other figures, presumably apostles, are shown with halos, their hands in prayer. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a radiant light, with golden rays emanating downwards. The background suggests an interior space with a red, ornate canopy on the left and architectural elements on the right, possibly indicating a room or a chapel.",
