She is dressed in a blue undergarment and a reddish-brown cloak lined with green, holding a red book with gold clasps. The background depicts rolling hills, scattered trees, and a distant view of a white building with golden spires, possibly a church or castle, under a blue sky with stylized stars. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded arch decorated with floral motifs.",
