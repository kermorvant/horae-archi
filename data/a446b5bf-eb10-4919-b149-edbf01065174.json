    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ speaking with a Samaritan woman at a well. Christ, identifiable by his halo and blue robe, gestures with his hands as he converses with the woman, who is dressed in a pink and blue garment and a jeweled headdress. She holds a jug, seemingly having just drawn water from the well. The well itself is a prominent feature, with a wooden structure above it for drawing water. In the background, a lush green landscape unfolds, dotted with trees and a body of water. Further in the distance, a city with prominent towers and spires is visible, suggesting an urban setting beyond the immediate rural location. The overall composition is framed by an ornate, gilded border with architectural motifs.",
