    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, kneeling and holding the Christ Child, is presented to a bearded man in priestly vestments, likely Simeon. To Mary's left stands a woman holding a basket containing doves, possibly representing the offering prescribed by the Law. Behind them, several figures observe the event. The background suggests an interior architectural setting with a grey, segmented wall and green decorative elements, possibly representing a temple or a church interior. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sanctity.",
