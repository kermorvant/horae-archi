    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a lone male figure, likely a saint or prophet, standing in prayer. He is dressed in a simple pink robe and has a halo around his head, indicating his sanctity. His hands are clasped together in supplication, and his gaze is directed upwards. He stands before a stylized representation of a tree with large, green leaves. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or spiritual setting. The figure is framed by architectural elements that resemble Gothic tabernacles, complete with spires and decorative tracery, rendered in blues, reds, and gold.",
