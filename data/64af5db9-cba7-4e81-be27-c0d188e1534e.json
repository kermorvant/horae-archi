    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a nude woman with long, flowing hair bathing in a hexagonal pool. She wears a cross necklace. To the left, a man in regal attire, wearing a crown and ermine-trimmed robe, stands behind a stone structure, holding a scepter. He appears to be observing the woman. Behind the pool, a garden with manicured bushes and flowerbeds is visible, bordered by trees and a distant landscape with hills and a castle. The architecture suggests a courtyard setting with classical elements like columns and arches.",
