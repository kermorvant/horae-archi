    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue robe, holds the Christ Child on her lap. Three Magi are present: one kneels before the child, offering a gift; another stands, holding a chalice; and a third, crowned, also holds a chalice. Behind them, a group of onlookers is visible through an arched opening. To the left, two donkeys and a bull are depicted. In the background, a landscape with a city skyline and figures on horseback can be seen. The architectural elements suggest a humble dwelling, with a thatched roof and wooden beams, framed by a larger arched structure.",
