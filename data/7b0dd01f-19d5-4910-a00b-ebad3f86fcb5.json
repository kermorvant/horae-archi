    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a celestial setting. A man, identified as King David by his crown, is shown with his hands raised in prayer or supplication, looking upwards towards a shower of golden rays and stars against a deep blue background. To his left, two figures in red and tan robes stand, one pointing towards David. To David's right, another figure, possibly an angel or prophet, also gestures upwards. In the foreground, a man kneels with his hands clasped in prayer, looking up at the divine light. The ground beneath the figures is rendered with rough, rocky textures and a stream of blue water. The overall impression is one of divine revelation or intercession.",
