    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial gathering with multiple winged figures, likely angels, surrounding a central seated figure who appears to be a woman. The background features stylized architectural elements resembling churches or chapels, with pointed arches and towers, set against a starry sky. The angels are shown in various poses, some appearing to interact with each other or with the seated woman. The overall impression is one of a divine or heavenly realm. The seated figure's posture and gaze suggest contemplation or reception of a divine message. The presence of architectural structures within this celestial setting might symbolize the heavenly Jerusalem or the divine presence within sacred spaces.",
