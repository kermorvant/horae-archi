    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in a landscape setting under an arched frame adorned with floral and insect motifs. The woman on the left, dressed in a vibrant blue robe with gold embellishments, stands with her hands clasped. The woman on the right, wearing a red cloak over a purple garment and a white veil, kneels and reaches out to the standing woman. Golden rays descend from above, suggesting a divine presence. The background features rolling hills, sparse trees, and a blue sky dotted with golden stars. This scene is interpreted as the Visitation, where Mary, pregnant with Christ, visits her cousin Elizabeth, who is also pregnant.",
