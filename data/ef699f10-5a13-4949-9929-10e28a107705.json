    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a female figure, identified by her halo and prayerful posture, kneeling and holding a cross. To her left, a monstrous creature with a gaping mouth and sharp teeth is shown. The figures are framed by architectural elements, including columns and an arched canopy, suggesting an interior or a stylized architectural setting. The background is filled with a stippled pattern. This imagery is commonly associated with Saint Margaret of Antioch, who is often depicted triumphing over a dragon or demon, symbolizing her victory over temptation and evil through faith.",
