    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures are gathered around a wooden cross. In the foreground, a nearly nude figure with a halo, possibly representing Christ, is being embraced by an older man in a blue robe. The older man has his arm around the nude figure's neck and is looking upwards. Behind them, several other figures with beards and halos are also looking upwards, with their hands raised. The background is a richly decorated tapestry-like pattern of small squares in red, blue, and white, with golden rays emanating from the top of the cross and extending downwards, suggesting divine light. The scene takes place on a green, grassy ground with some sparse vegetation.",
