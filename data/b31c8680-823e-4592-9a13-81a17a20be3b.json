    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a banquet, likely the Last Supper, set within an elaborately decorated interior. Several figures are seated around a long table laden with food and drink. Christ, identifiable by his halo and central position, is engaged in conversation with one of the disciples. The architecture features a rich blue tapestry with gold stars and tassels, and a golden, arched frame surrounds the scene. Windows with diamond-shaped panes are visible in the background. To the right, a gilded panel with blue lettering reads \"CENA DOMINI\" (The Lord's Supper). The overall impression is one of solemnity and religious significance, conveyed through the figures' gestures and the opulent setting.",
