    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe adorned with gold, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching towards a draped altar. A priest, in a red and gold chasuble, stands ready to receive the child. Behind them, several figures are gathered: a woman in a red dress and blue headdress holds a basket, and other men, some in religious attire, observe the event. The background features architectural elements suggesting an interior space, with arched windows and decorative drapery. The overall scene is rendered with rich colors and gold leaf, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
