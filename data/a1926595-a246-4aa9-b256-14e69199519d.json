    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, depicted in profile, wears a cap and a richly ornamented tunic. His right hand is raised, with the index finger extended, as if making a point or giving instruction. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a decorative or perhaps celestial setting. The figure's attire and gesture imply a moment of discourse or pronouncement.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The gesture of the raised index finger is often associated with teaching, preaching, or making a solemn declaration. Without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific biblical or devotional scene, but it could represent a prophet, an apostle, or a figure delivering a sermon or a divine message.",
