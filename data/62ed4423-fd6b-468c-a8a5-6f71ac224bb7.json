    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a richly decorated architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, haloed and dressed in flowing robes, is seated before a lectern with an open book. Her left hand rests on the book, while her right hand is raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. Behind her is a bed with a pillow. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, also haloed and winged, approaches with a staff in his left hand and points towards Mary with his right. A banner unfurls above them, inscribed with \"Ave gratia plena dominus tecum\" (Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee). Above the angel, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends. The architecture features elaborate Gothic tracery windows, columns, and ornate pinnacles, suggesting a sacred or noble interior.",
