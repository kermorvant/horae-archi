    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a red cap, dressed in a white tunic, standing barefoot in a large woven basket filled with dark purple grapes. His legs are submerged in the grapes, and he is pressing them with his feet. His hands rest on the rim of the basket. In the background, another figure, wearing a pink tunic and carrying a large basket on his back, walks up a grassy hill under a starry blue sky. A tree with yellow foliage is visible on the right. This scene likely represents the process of winemaking, specifically the treading of grapes, a common agricultural activity.",
