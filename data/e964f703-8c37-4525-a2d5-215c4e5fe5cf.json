    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and with a golden halo, kneels beside a manger. The Christ Child lies in the manger, illuminated by a golden light. A bull and a donkey are present, with the donkey resting in the foreground. Behind them, an elderly man, likely Saint Joseph, stands with his hands clasped in prayer, wearing a blue tunic and red cloak. The background features a rustic wooden structure of the stable, with a thatched roof. Beyond the stable, a walled town with spires and buildings is visible under a starry blue sky.",
