    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an outdoor pastoral setting with rolling green hills and scattered trees. Three figures are present: one on the left, dressed in blue and orange, holds a stone object and gestures upwards; a second figure in the center, cloaked in blue, faces away from the viewer; and a third figure on the right, clad in orange, stands with hands clasped in prayer. Above them, an angel with a halo descends from a blue sky filled with golden rays, holding a scroll with Latin text. Several sheep are visible grazing on the hillsides. The overall impression is one of divine intervention or revelation in a humble, earthly environment.",
