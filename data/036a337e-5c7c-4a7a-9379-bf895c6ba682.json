    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a person wearing a hat and a tunic, kneeling and holding a sickle, appearing to be harvesting or working in a field. In the foreground, a curved object, possibly a scythe blade or a tool, lies on the ground. Behind the figure, a fence-like structure is visible, and further in the background, a landscape with hills and what appears to be a building or structure can be seen. The overall impression is of agricultural labor in an outdoor setting.",
