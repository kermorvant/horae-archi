    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel in full armor, standing triumphantly over two defeated dragons. He is clad in a golden cuirass adorned with a lion's head motif, a blue cloak with gold stars, and golden greaves. In his right hand, he holds a golden horn to his lips, and in his left, a shield emblazoned with a blue field and gold stars. His wings are spread, and his gaze is directed downwards. The background features a stylized landscape with rolling blue hills, scattered trees, and small, simplified buildings, suggesting a rural or mountainous setting. The entire scene is framed by an illuminated arch with decorative elements.",
