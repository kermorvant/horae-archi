    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed figures stand in a landscape under a starry sky. On the left, a bishop, dressed in a blue cope over a red garment, wears a jeweled mitre and holds a pastoral staff and a red book. On the right, a tonsured monk in a black habit over a white tunic stands with his hand extended, holding a white object. In the background, a river flows past a fortified city with towers and spires, and a castle on a hill. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
