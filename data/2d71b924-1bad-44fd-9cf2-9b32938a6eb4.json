    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identifiable by the lion at his side, seated and writing. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a golden cloak, holding a quill and inkpot. In the background, through an arched opening, a group of figures in white robes are shown praying, looking towards a radiant figure of Christ or the Virgin Mary ascending. To the right, a loggia with large columns frames a landscape with a castle and a lone tree, suggesting an outdoor setting beyond the immediate interior.",
