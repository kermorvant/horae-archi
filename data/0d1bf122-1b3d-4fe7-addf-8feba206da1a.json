Within this structure, a figure resembling God, with a halo, stands to the right, gesturing with his right hand. To the left, a naked figure, likely Adam, reclines on a rock, appearing to be asleep or in a state of repose. A green, leafy tree is prominently displayed between them. The overall composition suggests a moment of creation or divine intervention.",
