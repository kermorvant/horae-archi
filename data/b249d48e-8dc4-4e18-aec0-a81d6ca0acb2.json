    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross in the center. To his left stands the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and praying with clasped hands. To his right is Saint John the Evangelist, wearing a red cloak over a blue tunic, looking upwards with an expression of sorrow. The figures are set against a blue sky with scattered clouds, and a green, grassy ground. In the background, to the left, are faint outlines of buildings, possibly a city or town. A skull is visible at the base of the cross, symbolizing Golgotha. The overall scene conveys the solemnity and grief associated with Christ's sacrifice.",
