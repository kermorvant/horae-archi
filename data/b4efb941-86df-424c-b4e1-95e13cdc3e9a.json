    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed women, likely the Virgin Mary and Saint Elizabeth, embracing outdoors in a verdant landscape. The woman on the left, dressed in white, appears younger and is holding the hands of the woman on the right, who is older and veiled, wearing a dark cloak. Behind them, rolling green hills are dotted with trees, and in the distance, a city with spires and towers is visible under a cloudy sky. To the right, a portion of a building with a dark, sloped roof and timber framing is depicted. The overall impression is one of a tender reunion in a pastoral setting with hints of urban civilization in the background.",
