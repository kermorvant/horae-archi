Elizabeth, older and veiled, wears a dark robe with a red heart motif visible on her skirt. Behind them, a stylized building with a red tiled roof, towers, and crenellations is visible, set against a blue sky with dark, wavy lines suggesting rain or divine presence. The figures are positioned on a green, grassy landscape.",
