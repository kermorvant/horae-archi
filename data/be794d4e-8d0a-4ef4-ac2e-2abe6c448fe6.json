    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with rolling green hills dotted with trees. In the foreground, three figures are present: two individuals in blue tunics and red hose, one kneeling and gesturing upwards, the other standing with hands clasped in prayer or supplication, and a woman in a pink dress standing between them. Several sheep are scattered around the figures, and a brown dog is visible. In the background, a fortified settlement with towers and spires is depicted on a hill. Above, in the sky, a winged figure, possibly an angel, is shown in a swirling cloud formation. The overall impression is of a rural setting with a hint of the divine intervention or observation.",
