    "scene_description_enriched": "A seated figure, likely a woman, wearing a blue robe over an orange garment and a green veil, gestures with her left hand towards a fireplace. She is seated on a stool. To her right, a standing figure, possibly a servant or messenger, carries a bundle of wood on their shoulder. The scene takes place indoors, with a tiled floor and a stone or brick wall in the background. An arched opening is visible on the right, revealing a glimpse of an outdoor landscape with hills and trees. The presence of a fireplace and the act of carrying wood suggest a domestic setting, possibly related to preparing for warmth or a task within the household.",
