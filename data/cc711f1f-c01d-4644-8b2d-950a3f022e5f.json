    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures within an interior space. On the left, a golden reliquary, intricately decorated with architectural motifs and figures, rests on a draped surface. Two women stand before it. One, dressed in a dark habit, gestures towards the reliquary and the kneeling woman. The kneeling woman, in a red gown and black veil, clasps her hands in prayer. Behind her, another woman in a purple robe holds a skull aloft, seemingly presenting it. The background suggests an interior with patterned walls and a decorative frieze.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of a reliquary and the act of prayer suggest a devotional scene, likely related to the veneration of a saint or martyr. The skull being presented could symbolize mortality and the veneration of relics, possibly associated with a saint known for their martyrdom or asceticism. The woman in the habit might be an abbess or a religious figure guiding the devotee.",
