    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, with the Virgin Mary seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child. Saint Joseph, an elderly man with a long beard, walks beside the donkey, leading it by a rope. They are in an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, rocky outcrops, and sparse trees. The sky is a vibrant blue, and the ground is rendered in shades of brown and green with small yellow dots. The figures are framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
