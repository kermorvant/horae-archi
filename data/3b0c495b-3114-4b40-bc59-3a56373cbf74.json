    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a richly decorated interior. On the left, several individuals in blue robes, possibly clergy or nobility, are engaged in reading or discussion. One figure, wearing a black habit and hood, kneels. In the center and right, a procession of figures in black hooded habits are gathered around a bier or altar, some holding books. The architecture features an arched arcade with windows behind, suggesting a cloister or a church interior. The ceiling is painted blue with gold stars, and the floor is a patterned wood. Decorative elements include gold candelabra and a golden basket with a bottle, possibly representing a funerary or devotional context.",
