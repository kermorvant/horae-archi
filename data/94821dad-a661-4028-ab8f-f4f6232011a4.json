    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine vision, with God the Father enthroned in the upper part, surrounded by golden rays and a blue background. Below Him, a row of flame-like figures, likely angels, are arranged. In the lower register, a group of seven men, identifiable as apostles or prophets by their halos and attentive gazes directed upwards, stand on a green, undulating landscape. They are dressed in medieval robes of red, blue, and pink. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine revelation or prophecy.",
