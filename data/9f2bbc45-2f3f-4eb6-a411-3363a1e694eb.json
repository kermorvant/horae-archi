    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in a verdant landscape. The woman on the left, with long auburn hair and a blue mantle, gently holds the hands of the woman on the right. The second woman, wearing a red cloak over a dark garment and a white and red striped head covering, looks towards the first. Behind them, rolling green hills are dotted with trees, and in the distance, a body of water and mountains are visible. A small, simple building with a red roof is nestled among the trees. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
