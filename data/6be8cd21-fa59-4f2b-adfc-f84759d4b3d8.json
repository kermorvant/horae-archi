    "scene_description_enriched": "A man in a dark robe, possibly a cleric, kneels and offers a book to a woman seated on a cushioned stool. The woman, dressed in dark attire and a veil, gestures with her right hand and appears to be writing or engaged in contemplation. The scene is framed by architectural elements, including a column and a canopy above the woman. A large, red, illuminated initial 'G' dominates the left side of the image, containing Latin text and a depiction of a tower. Rays of light emanate from the upper right corner, suggesting a divine presence or inspiration. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern. The overall scene evokes a moment of spiritual devotion or instruction.",
