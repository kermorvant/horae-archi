    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king seated on a raised dais, wearing a crown and royal blue robes, holding a scepter. Before him, a woman kneels, presenting a child. To the left, a soldier in blue armor, holding a sword raised as if to strike, is restrained by another figure in green robes. The setting appears to be an interior room with a tiled floor, a large window showing a landscape with birds, and a decorative ceiling with wooden beams and a blue canopy adorned with stars. The presence of a king, a woman with a child, and a soldier suggests a narrative of judgment or protection, possibly related to a biblical story.",
