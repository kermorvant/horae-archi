He is positioned in an outdoor setting with a landscape featuring hills and stylized vegetation. Behind him, a classical-style building with columns and pediments is visible, suggesting a grand architectural setting. The man's posture and expression convey deep prayer or distress. The scene is framed by a decorative border, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
