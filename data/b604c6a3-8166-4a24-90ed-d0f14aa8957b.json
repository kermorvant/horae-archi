The figure on the left, dressed in an orange robe over a brown garment, holds an open book and leans on a staff. The figure on the right, wearing a brown robe, has a beard and also holds a staff. Both figures appear to be in contemplation or discourse. The background depicts a green, hilly landscape under a blue sky with scattered clouds and birds. The overall scene suggests a moment of spiritual reflection or teaching.",
