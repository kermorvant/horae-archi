    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, likely a saint or cleric, stands in a landscape. He is dressed in a patterned outer garment over a white tunic and holds an open book in his left hand. In his right hand, he holds a staff or crozier. To his right, a dark, vertical structure with multiple bars, possibly a grille or cage, is depicted. The background shows a hilly landscape with trees. The figure's attire and the presence of a book suggest a learned or religious individual, and the barred structure might allude to imprisonment or martyrdom.",
