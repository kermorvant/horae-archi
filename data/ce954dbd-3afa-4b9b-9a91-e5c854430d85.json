    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, some with veiled heads and others with elaborate headwear, stand on the left. One figure, possibly a prophet or a wise man, with a long beard and a tall hat, gestures with an open hand towards a multi-headed beast on the right. The beast appears to be a dragon or a hydra with several serpentine necks and heads, some crowned. The scene is set against a neutral background, suggesting an outdoor or perhaps a symbolic space, with some rocky or uneven terrain depicted at the base of the beast.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a confrontation with a symbolic representation of evil or heresy, possibly related to the Book of Revelation or a similar apocalyptic text. The multi-headed beast is a common symbol of the Antichrist or demonic forces. The figures on the left, particularly the bearded man, may represent divine intervention or the triumph of faith over these forces.",
