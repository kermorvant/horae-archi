    "scene_description_enriched": "The left panel depicts a bearded man, possibly a scribe or scholar, wearing a blue and gold robe and a blue turban, seated at a lectern and writing on a scroll. He is positioned within an interior space with a window showing a landscape. The right panel illustrates the Nativity scene. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle and gold gown, kneels in prayer beside the Christ Child lying in a manger. Saint Joseph, in a red robe, kneels in adoration. Above them, an angel with golden wings descends, holding a scroll with text. In the background, two figures, possibly shepherds, are shown in a field with sheep, and a simple wooden structure, perhaps a stable, is visible.",
