    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the Virgin Mary cradling the lifeless body of Jesus in her lap. Christ's body is marked with wounds and blood, draped in a white loincloth. Around them, four women grieve, their faces etched with sorrow. The Virgin Mary wears a blue mantle over a white habit, her head bowed. Behind the figures, a wooden cross stands prominently. The background reveals a rolling landscape with a village nestled in the valley and distant hills, suggesting an outdoor setting at Golgotha. The overall composition conveys profound grief and the pathos of the Passion.",
