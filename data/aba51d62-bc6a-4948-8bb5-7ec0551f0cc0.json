    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with feathered wings and a halo, is shown gesturing towards the Virgin Mary. He wears a white robe with dark trim. Rays of divine light emanate from above, directed towards Mary. In the center, a vase holds lilies, a symbol of purity. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is depicted with a halo, her hands clasped in prayer over her chest. She wears a pink dress and a blue mantle. She is positioned near a lectern with an open book. The background features large windows with diamond-shaped panes, suggesting a Gothic architectural style. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. A red drapery hangs on the right side of the scene.",
