    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two shepherds in simple tunics, one holding a staff and looking upwards, the other standing beside him. A flock of sheep is gathered behind them. Above, a blue angelic figure with outstretched arms appears amidst a decorative background of gold quatrefoils on a white ground. The overall impression is one of a pastoral setting, possibly representing the Annunciation to the Shepherds.",
