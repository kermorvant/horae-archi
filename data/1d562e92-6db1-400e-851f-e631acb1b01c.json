    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ on the left, with a figure in a purple robe kneeling in prayer before him, his hand on his chest. To the right, a woman in a red headdress and robe sits with a lion, while in the background, two figures lead donkeys along a path. Further in the distance, a church with a spire is visible amidst rolling hills and trees. The overall setting is a verdant, hilly landscape under a blue sky with birds in flight. This scene is interpreted as the martyrdom of Saint Jerome, who is often depicted with lions and in contemplation of the Crucifixion.",
