    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, kneels beside a manger, gazing down at the Christ Child. Joseph, an elderly figure in a red cloak and blue tunic, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, leaning on a staff. Behind them, a cow and a donkey are visible. In the background, a pastoral landscape unfolds with rolling hills and a distant town featuring church spires. Rays of golden light descend from above, illuminating the scene and symbolizing divine presence. The overall composition evokes a sense of reverence and the miraculous birth.",
