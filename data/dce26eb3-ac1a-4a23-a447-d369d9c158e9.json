    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, with her ascending into heaven surrounded by a host of angels and putti. She is shown in a blue mantle and pink tunic, with her hands outstretched. Angels crown her with a wreath, while others support her ascent. Below, a group of apostles and other figures gaze upwards in awe and wonder, some with hands raised in supplication. The lower part of the scene suggests a tomb or sarcophagus, from which the Virgin is being taken up. The background transitions from dark, rocky clouds to a bright, ethereal sky.",
