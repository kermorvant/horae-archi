    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in profile, facing left. The figure in the foreground, dressed in a yellow tunic and red head covering, has a beard and appears to be kneeling or crouching. Behind and slightly to the right of this figure is another person in a green robe, also kneeling or crouching, with hands clasped in front. The background is plain, suggesting an outdoor or unadorned setting. The posture of the figures, particularly the clasped hands, suggests a moment of prayer or supplication.",
