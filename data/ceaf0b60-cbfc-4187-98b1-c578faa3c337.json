    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a woman with long hair stands beside a decorative architectural element. In the center, a table is set with a large, conical object, possibly a loaf of bread or a cake, and a palm frond. Two women are seated at the table, one holding a book and gesturing towards the object. Another woman stands behind them. To the right, a man with a beard is shown in profile, looking towards the central group. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior space, possibly a hall or a room within a building, with decorative arches and columns.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of a palm frond and the context of a gathering around a table with food suggests a scene related to a religious feast or commemoration, possibly the Feast of Palms or a related event in the Christian calendar. The woman holding a book could be a reader or a participant in a devotional act.",
