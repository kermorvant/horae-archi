    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a stable setting, framed by an arched architectural element. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and purple mantle, gazes down with folded hands at the Christ Child lying in a manger. Saint Joseph, with a white beard and red tunic, leans over the manger, his gaze also directed at the infant. Behind them, a donkey and an ox are visible. The background suggests a rough stone structure, possibly part of the stable, with a hint of blue sky beyond. The overall composition conveys a tender and devotional moment of the birth of Christ.",
