    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic and violent encounter between monstrous figures. On the left, a creature with a lion-like mane and sharp teeth appears to be lunging forward. To its right, another beast, possibly a demon or a grotesque animal, is shown in profile, with sharp claws and a snarling expression. In the center, a smaller, more humanoid creature with a horned head is being attacked by a larger, ape-like figure. The background is filled with swirling lines suggesting flames or turbulent energy, and hints of architectural elements, possibly decorative borders or stylized structures, are visible on the far right. The overall impression is one of infernal struggle or a depiction of hellish torment.",
