    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and vestments, stands holding a book in his left hand and a processional cross in his right. He is depicted within an architectural frame, possibly representing a niche or a decorative archway. The background is filled with a stippled pattern. To the right of the bishop, a small animal, possibly a dog, is visible at his feet. The overall scene suggests a saintly figure, likely a bishop, in a devotional or authoritative pose.",
