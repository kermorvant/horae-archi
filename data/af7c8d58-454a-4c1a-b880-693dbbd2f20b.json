    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely a man, with wavy hair and a simple garment, positioned outdoors. He is shown in profile, looking towards the left, with his hands raised to his mouth as if playing a wind instrument or singing. To his left, a stylized tree or plant with feathery leaves is visible, and scattered dots suggest a starry sky or a natural setting. The figure's posture and the surrounding elements evoke a pastoral or contemplative mood, possibly representing a musician or a shepherd in a natural environment.",
