    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, adorned with a halo, is shown tending to the Christ Child, who lies on the ground radiating light. An angel kneels beside them, hands clasped in prayer. Saint Joseph, with a beard and wearing a monastic habit, sits to the right, holding a staff. A cow and a donkey are present, with the donkey's head visible above Saint Joseph. In the background, through an open doorway of the stable, two figures are seen looking out, and beyond them, a landscape with trees and a distant city with towers is depicted. The architecture of the stable is simple, with visible wooden beams and a thatched roof.",
