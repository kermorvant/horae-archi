    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a sorrowful woman, likely Mary Magdalene, standing in a landscape under a starry night sky. She wears a blue gown and a purple mantle, her head covered by a white veil. Tears stream down her face, and she clutches a golden vessel, possibly an alabastron containing ointment, inscribed with text. In the background, two figures in religious attire, possibly other women, stand near a low fence. Beyond them, a stylized landscape unfolds with rolling hills, trees, and distant walled cities illuminated by golden light. The overall impression is one of profound grief and devotion.",
