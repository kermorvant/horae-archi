To her left, two figures, one with red wings and a conical hat, hold an open book. To her right, an angel with blue wings plays a harp, accompanied by another figure in a purple robe. The background features a richly patterned golden tapestry and architectural elements suggesting a grand interior, with tall, narrow windows visible on either side. The scene evokes a sense of divine presence and worship.",
