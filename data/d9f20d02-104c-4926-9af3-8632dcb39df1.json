    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, wounded and bleeding from his hands and side, emerging from a tomb or sarcophagus. He is haloed and holds a cross. Two figures in dark, hooded robes and armor stand guard on either side of the tomb, one on the left with a spear and the other on the right, who is seated and holds a shield. In the background, a stylized landscape with trees and buildings under a blue sky with radiating golden light suggests a divine or heavenly setting. The overall scene represents the Resurrection of Christ.",
