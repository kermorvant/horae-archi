Christ is shown with a halo and a loincloth, his arms outstretched. Below the cross, a group of mourners is gathered. On the left, a woman in a blue mantle, likely the Virgin Mary, stands with her hands clasped in prayer, accompanied by another woman in pink. To the right of Christ, a figure in a red robe and elaborate headdress looks away, while other figures are partially visible in the background. The setting is an outdoor landscape with a blue sky and hints of distant hills or structures. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
