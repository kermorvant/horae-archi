    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures under an arched architectural element. On the left, a young person with a halo holds out their hands. In the center, a woman, also with a halo, wears a veil and holds her hands clasped to her chest. To the right, a bearded man with a hat gestures with his right hand, pointing upwards. Behind him, a building with a tower and windows is visible. The overall composition suggests a narrative scene, possibly religious, given the halos.",
