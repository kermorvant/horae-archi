    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, dressed in a red robe with a black veil and white cuffs, kneels on a patterned rug before an open book placed on a green cloth-covered stand. Her hands are clasped in prayer. Behind her, a striped canopy is visible, and beyond that, an outdoor scene with a stone structure and a garden with red-flowered plants under a blue sky. A shield with a monogram is placed to the right of the kneeling woman. The left side of the image features a decorative border with floral and avian motifs.",
