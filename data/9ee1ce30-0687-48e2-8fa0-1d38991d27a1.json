    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man, likely a monk or hermit, seated and holding a rosary, with his right hand raised and pointing upwards. He is dressed in a dark, hooded robe. Behind him, a stylized floral motif is visible. In the background, a cluster of religious buildings, including a church with a prominent cross and a bell tower, are rendered in a simplified architectural style. The text above, \"Hepi quoniam epau diet dominus: Vocem orationis mce [O]luia\", suggests a devotional context, possibly a psalm or prayer.",
