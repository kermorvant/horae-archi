    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in a pastoral setting. Two figures stand, one in a red robe with a hood and holding a staff, and another in a blue robe with a hood, also holding a staff. A third figure kneels in the foreground, dressed in blue and looking upwards with hands clasped in prayer. A flock of sheep is gathered in the middle ground. In the background, there are trees and a building with a stepped roof, possibly a barn or a simple dwelling. Rays of divine light descend from the sky, illuminating the scene, and birds are depicted in flight. The overall impression is one of divine revelation or blessing upon the shepherds and their flock.",
