    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the Virgin Mary cradling the body of her dead son. Christ's body is shown in a contorted pose, with wounds visible. The Virgin Mary, with a sorrowful expression, supports him. To the left, a figure with a halo, possibly John the Evangelist, looks on with grief. Below them, a kneeling monk in a habit prays fervently. To the right, another figure with a halo, likely Mary Magdalene, also appears in prayer, with a kneeling woman in a crown beside her, possibly a donor figure or a saint. The background is abstract, with clouds and hints of rocky terrain, suggesting a spiritual or heavenly setting. The entire composition is framed by an ornate, decorative arch with intricate patterns.",
