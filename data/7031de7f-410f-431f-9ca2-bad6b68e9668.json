    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded male figures, likely representing the Father and the Son, are seated side-by-side, engaged in reading from a large, open book placed between them. They are draped in red cloaks over white tunics. Above them, a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from a radiant blue background, with golden rays emanating outwards. The figures are framed by an arched architectural element, with decorative elements and stylized faces visible on the orange background within the arch. The scene is set against a blue and gold decorative border.",
