    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in clerical attire within an interior architectural space. On the left, a large, ornate structure, possibly an altar or a tomb, is draped with a blue cloth adorned with gold patterns. Behind it, a relief carving of figures is visible. In the center, a lectern holds an open book with musical notation. Two men, one in a white alb and chasuble, and another in a blue mantle, stand near the lectern. The man in the chasuble gestures with his right hand, as if speaking or leading a chant. The background reveals architectural elements such as pointed arches, windows with tracery, and columns, suggesting a church or chapel setting. The overall impression is one of a liturgical service or a devotional scene.",
