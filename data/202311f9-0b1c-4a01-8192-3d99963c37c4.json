    "scene_description_enriched": "A vibrant floral arrangement fills the center of the image, featuring a variety of flowers including roses, irises, lilies, hyacinths, and other blossoms in shades of red, pink, blue, purple, and white. The bouquet is held in an ornate blue vase with gold detailing. To the left, a small bird, possibly a goldfinch, is perched on a surface, looking upwards. To the right, a butterfly with colorful wings rests on the same surface. The background is a plain, light color, and at the top, blue text reads \"vivamus jugiter in cœli regione. Amen.\". The scene is rendered with meticulous detail, suggesting a devotional context, possibly related to the transience of earthly life and the hope for eternal life in heaven, as hinted by the Latin inscription.",
