    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, possibly a jester or musician, is depicted playing two drums. The figure wears a red tunic over blue sleeves, a purple band around their head, and a green, pointed hat. They are seated on a green mound with stylized grass. The background is filled with decorative floral and foliate motifs, including small insects and berries, rendered in a typical medieval manuscript style. The scene is purely decorative and does not appear to depict a specific religious or biblical event.",
