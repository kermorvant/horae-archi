    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a richly decorated architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, is shown within a tent-like structure draped with red and green fabrics. She is looking downwards with her hands crossed over her chest, and a book lies open on a lectern before her. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers near her. On the right, the Angel Gabriel, dressed in a pink robe and adorned with large blue and gold wings, approaches. He holds a scroll inscribed with text, and his gaze is directed towards Mary. The background reveals a Gothic architectural interior with pointed arches, columns, and windows, suggesting a church or chapel.",
