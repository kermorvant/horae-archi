    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and the cross she holds, is depicted riding on the back of a monstrous, horned creature. She wears a blue robe and a red cloak, her hands clasped around a golden cross. The creature, with its dark, scaly hide and fierce expression, appears to be a demon or a representation of evil. Behind the saint, a grey wall with decorative gold elements suggests an architectural setting, possibly a stylized representation of a heavenly or divine space.",
