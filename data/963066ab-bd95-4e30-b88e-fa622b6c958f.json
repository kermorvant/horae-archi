    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed male figures stand in a verdant landscape. The figure on the left, dressed in an orange robe over a mauve tunic, holds a blue book and a sword. The figure on the right, in a blue robe over an orange tunic, holds a large key. Both figures have white beards and are looking upwards. Behind them is a decorative tapestry-like background with a geometric pattern of blue, pink, and gold squares. Above the tapestry, a blue sky with golden rays emanates from an unseen source, framed by an arched border adorned with scrolling vines and flowers. The scene is bordered by gold.",
