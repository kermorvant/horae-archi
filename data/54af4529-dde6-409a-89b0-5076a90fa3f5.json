    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a richly decorated architectural setting. On the right, the Virgin Mary, seated on an ornate throne, is shown with her hand on her chest and holding a book, looking downwards. To the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large red wings, kneels and gestures towards Mary, seemingly delivering the message of her conception. Above them, a row of smaller panels shows angels playing various musical instruments, including drums, a lute, and a harp. The architecture features pink walls, arched windows with blue panes, and decorative gold patterns. The overall impression is one of divine revelation and celestial celebration.",
