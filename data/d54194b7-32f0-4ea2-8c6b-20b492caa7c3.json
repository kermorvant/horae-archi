    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded male figure, likely a saint, standing and reading a book. He wears a halo and a long robe, and holds a staff. Above him, within an arched frame, a group of figures with halos are depicted, with one central figure appearing to be in prayer or contemplation. The background is filled with ornate scrolling foliage. To the sides of the central figure, there are representations of trees or plants, and to the far left and right, there are indistinct forms that might represent clouds or celestial phenomena. The overall composition suggests a devotional or theological theme, possibly representing a saint in contemplation or receiving divine inspiration.",
