    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Adam and Eve in a garden setting. Adam, on the left, is shown with a beard and is holding an apple. Eve, on the right, is pregnant and is also reaching for or holding an apple. A serpent, coiled around a tree, is prominently featured. The serpent's head is near Eve, and a severed human head, possibly representing the consequence of the sin, dangles from the tree. The background is a deep blue with gold stars, suggesting a celestial or otherworldly realm, though the foreground shows green grass and trees, indicating an earthly garden.",
