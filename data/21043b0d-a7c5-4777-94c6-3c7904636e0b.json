    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the Virgin Mary cradling the body of Jesus in her lap. To the left, a bearded man in a white robe and orange garment, possibly Joseph of Arimathea, gestures with his hand. To the right, another figure in a grey robe with red trim looks on, and a kneeling figure in a pink robe anoints Christ's feet. In the background, Golgotha is depicted with three crosses, two of which bear crucified figures. Figures are shown on a rocky, uneven terrain, with some architectural elements resembling towers and walls in the distance. The overall scene is rendered with a gold halo around the heads of the main figures, indicating their sanctity.",
