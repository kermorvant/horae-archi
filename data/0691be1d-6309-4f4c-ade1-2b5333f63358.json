On the left, three women are depicted, one in a pink robe and veil, another in a blue robe with gold trim, and a third partially obscured. They appear to be looking towards the right. On the right, a bearded man, identified as Christ by his halo, is shown in a blue robe and a dark undergarment. He is holding a red, ornate book and is reaching out to touch the arm of the woman in the blue robe. The background is a dark blue textile with a repeating gold geometric pattern. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
