    "scene_description_enriched": "A golden background suggests a divine or spiritual setting. In the foreground, a reclining male figure, likely Adam, rests on a pinkish-brown surface, his head supported by his hand and his other hand placed on his chest. Behind him, a standing female figure, possibly Eve, gently holds his arm. To the left, a figure in a blue robe with a pink lining, identified by a halo, gestures with her right hand, her left hand touching the standing female figure's arm. This scene is framed by an architectural element with pointed arches and decorative patterns, suggesting a stylized representation of a sacred space.",
