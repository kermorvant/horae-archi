    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, bleeding from his wounds. To his left kneels the Virgin Mary, her head bowed in sorrow and her hands clasped. To his right stands a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also in a posture of grief. The figures are set against a backdrop of a rocky, barren landscape under a blue sky. The entire scene is framed by a golden border, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
