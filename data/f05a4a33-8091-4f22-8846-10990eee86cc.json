    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures, likely clergy, carries a golden, miniature architectural structure, possibly a reliquary or a model of a church, on poles. The figures are dressed in liturgical vestments, including blue and red robes with gold trim, and white undergarments. They are depicted outdoors in a grassy area with stylized green foliage. The background is a red patterned textile, suggesting an indoor setting or a decorative border. The figures appear to be looking upwards, perhaps in reverence or anticipation. The scene likely depicts a religious procession or the transport of a sacred relic.",
