    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. An elderly man, likely Simeon, with a halo, holds the Christ Child, who is naked and swaddled in white cloth on a draped table. Simeon wears a richly decorated golden robe. Behind him, a crowd of onlookers observes. To the right, a man in a white garment holds a basket containing two doves, presumably for sacrifice. Facing them, the Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and a white veil, stands with her hands clasped in prayer. The background suggests an interior space with architectural elements like columns and decorative walls, and a patterned ceiling.",
