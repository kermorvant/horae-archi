    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an arched architectural space. On the left, two figures in clerical attire, one in red and the other in green, are engaged in reading a book. In the center and right, three figures are dressed in dark hooded robes, suggesting they are monks or clergy. A blue, tent-like structure, possibly a catafalque or a symbolic representation of a tomb, is prominently placed in the foreground, adorned with candles. The background reveals architectural elements including ribbed vaults in blue and pink, arched windows, and what appears to be a tiered structure. The overall setting suggests a religious or funerary context, possibly a vigil or a memorial service.",
