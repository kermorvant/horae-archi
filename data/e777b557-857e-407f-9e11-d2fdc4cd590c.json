    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Kiss of Judas, a pivotal moment in the Passion of Christ. Jesus, with a halo, stands in the center, his face turned slightly, as Judas, identifiable by his green cloak and golden hair, embraces and kisses him. Jesus's hands are bound. Around them, a crowd of soldiers and figures in armor, some holding lanterns and spears, surround Jesus, apprehending him. One soldier in ornate blue armor and red-striped hose is prominent on the left, while another figure in gold armor kneels on the ground to the right, holding a lantern. The background features a stylized landscape with a body of water in the foreground, rolling green hills, and a distant, indistinct town under a starry blue sky. The overall composition conveys the betrayal and arrest of Jesus.",
