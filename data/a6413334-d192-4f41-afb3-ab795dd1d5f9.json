    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated centrally, her hands crossed over her chest, with a sorrowful expression. She is surrounded by a group of men, some with beards, who appear to be apostles or disciples. They are gesturing and looking towards Mary, some with hands clasped in prayer or contemplation. Above them, a golden halo emanates rays of light in red, green, and yellow, suggesting a divine presence or event. The figures are depicted indoors, on a floor with a patterned tile design. The overall composition evokes a moment of profound spiritual significance.",
