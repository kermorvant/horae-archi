    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a brutal martyrdom. In the foreground, a pale, emaciated figure lies on a stone block, seemingly undergoing torture or execution. Two men are actively engaged in the violence: one, dressed in a blue patterned tunic, raises a hammer-like object to strike, while another in a yellow tunic appears to be using a sharp instrument on the victim's torso. A crowd of onlookers, some in elaborate hats and robes, observe the gruesome event. Behind them, a colonnade of classical columns frames a distant landscape featuring castles and buildings, suggesting an urban or semi-urban setting. The architectural elements include ornate columns and decorative carvings on the wall behind the onlookers, hinting at a grand interior space.",
