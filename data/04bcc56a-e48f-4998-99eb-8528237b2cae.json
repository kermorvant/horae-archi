    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child across a body of water. Saint Christopher, a large man with a beard, wears a golden robe and carries a staff. The Christ Child, with a halo, sits on his shoulders, holding a golden orb and pointing upwards. In the background, a figure holding a lantern stands near a building, and a distant castle is visible on a hill overlooking the water. The overall setting is a river crossing with a hint of civilization in the distance.",
