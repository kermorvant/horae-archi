    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a beard and long hair, wearing a blue tunic, purple cloak, and red sash, stands behind a kneeling woman. He holds a large sword above her head, poised to strike. The woman, with blonde hair and a halo, wears a blue dress and a red cloak, her hands clasped in prayer. She kneels on a red drapery. To the right, a stone tower with arched openings and crenellations is visible. The background depicts a hilly landscape with trees and buildings, suggesting an outdoor setting. The scene likely represents the martyrdom of a saint, possibly Saint Barbara, given the tower element.",
