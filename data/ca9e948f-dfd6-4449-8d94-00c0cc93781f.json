    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered within an arched architectural frame. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Beside her, another figure, possibly Saint John the Evangelist, also kneels in prayer. Behind them, a crowd of men, all with halos, look upwards with expressions of awe and devotion. One man in the center, wearing a green garment, gestures with his hands towards the sky. Above them, in a niche or window, a dove descends, radiating light, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The background suggests an interior space with walls and windows, framed by an ornate archway with decorative elements.",
