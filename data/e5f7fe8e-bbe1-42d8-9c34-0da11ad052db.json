    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, meeting Elizabeth, who is wearing a pink outer garment and a white veil. They are embracing, their hands clasped. To the left, a bearded man in a red cloak and blue tunic, likely Saint Joseph, stands behind Mary. To the right, a young woman in a golden dress, possibly a handmaiden, stands behind Elizabeth. The figures are set in a lush green landscape with trees. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible under a hazy blue sky. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
