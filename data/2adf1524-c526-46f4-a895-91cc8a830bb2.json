    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a lush, verdant landscape, possibly a garden or orchard, with trees and foliage surrounding them. In the center, a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is seated and holding a child, presumably Christ. Another female figure, possibly Saint Anne, is seated beside her, looking towards the child. The figures are rendered with soft outlines and appear to be engaged in a tender, familial interaction. The overall impression is one of pastoral serenity and maternal devotion.",
