    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a rocky, hilly landscape with scattered trees and a distant walled city. In the foreground, a figure identified as Christ kneels in prayer, his hands clasped. To his right, another figure, likely an apostle, looks towards Christ. In the lower left, a bearded man in blue and red robes is seated, holding a book. Above Christ, a chalice rests on a rocky outcrop, illuminated by divine light. In the upper right, a figure, possibly God the Father or a prophet, is depicted in a cloud, holding a small figure, perhaps Christ as a child, or a symbolic representation of the Eucharist. The overall scene suggests a moment of divine revelation or prayer.",
