    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a gathering of numerous figures, predominantly human, with Christ at the center, holding a globe and raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing or teaching. He is surrounded by a diverse crowd including the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her blue robe and clasped hands, a knight in armor with a red surcoat bearing a golden cross, various clergy in liturgical vestments (including bishops with mitres and a cardinal's hat), and laypeople. Several figures are kneeling, particularly monks in their habits. In the background, banners and processional crosses are visible, suggesting a religious procession or a significant devotional event. The figures are set against a golden background, with a blue, cloud-like border at the top and bottom, indicating a spiritual or heavenly setting.",
