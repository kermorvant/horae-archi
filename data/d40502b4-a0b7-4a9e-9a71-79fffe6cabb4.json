    "scene_description_enriched": "A funeral procession is depicted outdoors, with a group of clerics in black hooded robes and several priests in white albs and ornate vestments. Some priests hold crosses and read from a book. In the foreground, two figures, likely gravediggers, are preparing a burial, one holding a shroud and the other tending to a body wrapped in white. A skull and bones are visible in the grassy ground, suggesting a cemetery. Behind the procession, a church building with a tiled roof and arched windows is visible, with a statue of a saint on its facade. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
