    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, kneeling with hands clasped in prayer, his large red wings spread behind him. He is dressed in a blue robe. Facing him on the right is the Virgin Mary, also kneeling, with her hands clasped over her chest, and a book open before her. She wears a brown dress and a blue mantle. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from above, with rays of light emanating from it towards the Virgin. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that includes large columns and a detailed background suggesting a cityscape seen through a window. The floor is tiled in a pinkish hue.",
