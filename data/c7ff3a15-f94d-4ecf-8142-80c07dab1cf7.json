    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth, his body showing wounds from which blood drips. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, stands with her hands clasped in prayer, accompanied by two other women. To the right, a group of soldiers, some armed with spears, observe the scene. In the background, rolling hills are dotted with stylized trees and a walled city with towers. The scene is framed by ornate golden columns on the sides.",
