    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned figure kneeling with hands raised in prayer. The figure is dressed in a royal robe of pink lined with ermine, over a blue tunic. In the upper part of the image, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is shown within a golden halo and blue wings, with rays of light descending towards the praying figure. The background features a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a distant view of a fortified city with towers and spires, and a bridge with arches spanning a body of water. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine revelation or supplication.",
