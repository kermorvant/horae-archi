    "scene_description_enriched": "In a forest setting, a man in hunting attire, including a red tunic, yellow breeches, and black hose, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. He is accompanied by a horse laden with hunting gear. Before him stands a stag, and miraculously, a depiction of Christ on the cross is affixed to the stag's antlers, appearing as if crucified upon the branches of a tree. The background is filled with dense foliage and trees, suggesting a deep woodland.",
