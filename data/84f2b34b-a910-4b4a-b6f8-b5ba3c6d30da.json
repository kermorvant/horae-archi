    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue, rides a white donkey, holding the Christ Child. To the right, an older man, possibly Joseph, walks alongside, wearing a green hat and a golden tunic. Behind them, a large, indistinct figure, possibly another traveler or a pack animal, is visible. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling hills and sparse vegetation, rendered with gold leaf accents suggesting divine presence or richness.",
