    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ, with Christ's body, bleeding from wounds and wearing a crown of thorns, being lowered from the cross. His body is partially submerged in a sarcophagus-like structure. A blue cloth is draped over the edge of this structure. Above Christ, a ladder leans against a cross-like beam, and a rooster is perched on it. Various instruments of the Passion are visible, including nails, a hammer, pincers, a sponge on a reed, and a lance. A sign with \"INRI\" is displayed. The background is a deep blue with golden stars and celestial symbols, suggesting a metaphysical or divine setting. The lower part of the image shows tools and a depiction of Christ's head, possibly representing the Veronica's Veil or a relic. The overall composition is rich with symbolic elements and detailed iconography.",
