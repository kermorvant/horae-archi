    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act in a grassy outdoor setting, framed by an ornate, arched border. In the foreground, a figure in blue kneels, cradling a wounded infant. To the right, another figure in yellow, wearing a red hat, appears to be the aggressor, holding a baby aloft. A third figure, draped in white and beige, stands between them, reaching out as if to intervene or protect. The background features a decorative lattice pattern in gold, blue, and brown, suggesting a stylized or symbolic representation rather than a realistic architectural space.",
