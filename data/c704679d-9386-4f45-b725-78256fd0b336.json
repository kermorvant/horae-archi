    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable structure. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle and white veil, kneels with her hands clasped over her chest, gazing downwards. Beside her, the Christ Child lies in a manger, bathed in a golden halo. To the left, Saint Joseph, an elderly man with a white beard, is seated, leaning on a staff, also looking towards the child. Behind them, several figures, possibly shepherds, peer into the stable from an opening. In the background, a landscape with buildings and a body of water is visible. The stable itself is constructed of wooden beams and planks, with a thatched roof.",
