    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, dressed in a pink tunic, blue hose, and a blue cap, is depicted sowing seeds in a field. He holds a bag of seeds over his shoulder and scatters seeds from his hand onto the ploughed ground. To his right, a large sack of seeds rests on the ground. In the background, a rolling landscape with scattered trees and distant, stylized castles or ruins is visible under a pale blue sky. The scene represents the agricultural activity of sowing, likely symbolizing the start of the planting season or a metaphor for spiritual sowing.",
