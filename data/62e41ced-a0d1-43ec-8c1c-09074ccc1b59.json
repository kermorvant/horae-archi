    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, with Saint Joseph standing to the right. Mary, wearing a blue mantle and white veil, gazes downwards with closed eyes. The Christ Child, dressed in a red tunic, looks upwards. Saint Joseph, with a long white beard and wearing a green cloak over a red garment, is shown in profile, looking away from the central figures. The background is a landscape with rolling green hills, trees, and a distant blue body of water with a castle-like structure on a hill. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
