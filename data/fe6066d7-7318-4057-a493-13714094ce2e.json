    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural setting that opens to a landscape. On the right, an older woman, likely Saint Anne, is seated, wearing a pink robe and a white veil, and is engaged in reading from a book. To her left, a younger woman, presumably the Virgin Mary, stands and looks down at the book, her hands also touching it. She wears a blue gown and a crown, indicating her royal or divine status. The interior space is suggested by a dark, possibly wooden, ceiling and a patterned wall behind Saint Anne. The foreground floor is tiled in blue. Through an arched opening, a detailed landscape is visible with a river, rolling hills, trees, and a fortified city with towers and spires in the distance. The overall scene likely represents the education or instruction of the young Virgin Mary by her mother, Saint Anne, a common theme in devotional art.",
