    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting that suggests a domestic interior with elements of religious architecture. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe and white veil, is seated and reading from a book placed on a stand. She is illuminated by a golden halo. Facing her is an angel, identifiable by his green attire and a scroll bearing the inscription \"Ave Maria, gratia plena\". The angel is gesturing towards Mary, signifying the divine message. Behind them, a red canopy covers a bed, and a patterned carpet with green and white squares covers the floor. The architectural elements include arched doorways, windows with tracery, and what appears to be a vaulted ceiling or dome in the background, all framed by a decorative border.",
