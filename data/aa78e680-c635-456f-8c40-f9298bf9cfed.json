    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identified by her halo, embracing Elizabeth, who is also haloed. Mary wears a blue mantle over a red dress, while Elizabeth is in a red dress and a white head covering. To the left, a bearded man in a blue mantle and red robe, holding a staff, likely represents Saint Joseph or a religious figure accompanying Mary. To the right, a woman in a blue dress and red cap, holding a bouquet of white flowers, is likely a companion or attendant. The figures are set against a landscape with a body of water, rolling hills, and in the background, a city with towers and spires. The sky above is a deep blue with radiating golden light, suggesting divine presence.",
