    "scene_description_enriched": "A single figure, likely a woman, is depicted from the waist up, with her head tilted back and eyes closed, suggesting a moment of intense emotion or prayer. She wears a blue tunic and a light brown head covering that drapes around her neck. Her hands are clasped or held close to her chest. The background is a textured gold leaf, typical of manuscript illumination, with decorative blue and white borders framing the scene. The figure stands on a horizontal band, possibly representing a platform or the ground.",
