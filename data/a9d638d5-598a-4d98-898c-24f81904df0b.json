    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a profile view of a person, likely a woman, wearing an elaborate headdress with flowing hair and a patterned garment. She is holding a shallow bowl or dish in her hands. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling a pointed arch with decorative tracery, suggesting an interior or a niche within a larger structure. The overall style is characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a devotional scene, possibly a saint or a figure associated with a specific religious narrative. The act of holding a bowl could allude to offering, receiving, or a symbolic gesture within a religious context. Without further iconographic clues, a precise interpretation is difficult, but it aligns with the typical imagery found in Books of Hours for personal devotion.",
