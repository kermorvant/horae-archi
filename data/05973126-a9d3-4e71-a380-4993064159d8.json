    "scene_description_enriched": "Two shepherds are depicted in a grassy landscape with sheep. One shepherd, seated on the right, looks upwards with his hand raised. The other shepherd, seated on the left, also looks upwards with his hand raised. A bagpipe and a pouch lie on the ground near the seated shepherd on the left. In the background, a walled town or castle complex is visible on a hill, with several buildings and towers. Above the landscape, a winged figure, possibly an angel or a demon, flies across a golden sky. The scene likely depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a key event in the Nativity narrative.",
