    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures, led by a crowned man in a golden robe, moves through a green landscape towards a fortified city in the distance. The crowned figure, likely a king, is accompanied by several other men, some with beards and wearing turbans or caps. The city in the background features tall towers, crenellated walls, and spires, suggesting a significant urban or royal center. The scene is framed by an architectural element, possibly an archway or a decorative border, on the left and right sides, with a glimpse of a blue sky with scattered clouds above.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a royal procession or a significant journey, possibly related to a biblical narrative involving kings, such as the Adoration of the Magi or a scene from the life of King David. The fortified city in the background could represent Jerusalem or another important biblical city.",
