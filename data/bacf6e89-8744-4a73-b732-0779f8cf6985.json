    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a winged figure, likely an angel, in armor, engaged in combat with demonic creatures. The angel, with a serene expression and a sword raised, is shown stepping on and subduing one of the demons, which has a grotesque, horned face and clawed hands. Another demon, with a bird-like beak and multiple eyes, is also visible, seemingly struggling. The background is abstract, with no discernible architectural elements or specific setting, suggesting a spiritual or allegorical battle.",
