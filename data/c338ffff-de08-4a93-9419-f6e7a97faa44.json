    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a decorative quatrefoil frame. On the left, a woman kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a pink robe and a white wimple. She is facing a standing figure on the right, who is dressed in a grey monastic habit. This standing figure, identified by a halo, holds a book in their left hand and a palm frond in their right. A rope belt with large, decorative knots is visible around their waist. The background is a repeating geometric pattern of small red and blue diamonds on a gold ground, framed by blue and red borders. The overall composition suggests a devotional scene, likely depicting a saint receiving a supplicant.",
