    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame adorned with foliate motifs, a central female figure, likely a saint or allegorical figure, is depicted seated. She wears a crown or headdress and a richly patterned robe. In her left hand, she holds an open book, while her right hand rests on a staff or scepter topped with three prongs. To her left, a smaller figure, possibly an attendant or a representation of a virtue, is shown holding a similar staff. The scene is rendered in a detailed, somewhat stylized manner, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a female saint or an allegorical figure, possibly associated with wisdom, justice, or a specific virtue, given the book and the scepter. Without further iconographic clues or context, a precise identification is difficult. The presence of the book suggests learning or scripture, while the scepter could symbolize authority or power.",
