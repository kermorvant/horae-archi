    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and wounds, reaching down with a red banner attached to a staff towards a soul being pulled from a fiery abyss. The soul, depicted with multiple faces and bodies, is partially engulfed in flames and appears to be reaching up towards Christ. A dark, demonic figure with horns and a gaping mouth is seated behind the soul, seemingly attempting to pull it back into the abyss. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or otherworldly setting. The figures are framed by architectural elements at the top, resembling stylized crenellations and spires, and vertical pilasters on the sides.",
