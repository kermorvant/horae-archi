    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross in the center. To his left stands a bearded man wearing a hat and holding a staff, possibly a Roman soldier or a bystander. To Christ's right are two women, one with her hands clasped in prayer, likely the Virgin Mary, and another figure, possibly Mary Magdalene. The figures are framed by architectural elements that suggest a stylized representation of a building or a niche, with decorative pinnacles and arches.",
