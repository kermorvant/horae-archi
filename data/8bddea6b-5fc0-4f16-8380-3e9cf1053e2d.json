    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Adam, unclothed and with a pensive expression, holding a red fruit in his right hand and covering himself with a large green leaf in his left. To his left, a tree with red fruits is entwined by a green and red serpent. The background is a rich blue, decorated with white foliate motifs. The text surrounding the image suggests a biblical narrative. This scene is interpreted as the Fall of Man, specifically the moment of Adam receiving the forbidden fruit from the serpent, leading to the loss of innocence.",
