    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition from the Cross. Christ's body, pale and limp, is being lowered from the cross by two men. One man, dressed in blue, stands on a ladder, reaching to support the body. Another man, in a pink robe, holds Christ's legs and torso. To the left, two women mourn. The woman in blue, veiled, likely represents the Virgin Mary, while the woman in orange with a halo is likely Mary Magdalene or another follower. The background is a stylized landscape with green hills and a blue sky with clouds. Three crosses are visible in the distance.",
