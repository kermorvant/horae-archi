    "scene_description_enriched": "In a scene set against a starry blue sky, Christ, depicted with a golden halo and radiating divine light, points downwards with his left hand. Below him, a dark, beast-like creature lies defeated on a grassy ground, pierced by a staff held by a kneeling figure. This figure, along with a group of onlookers dressed in blue and green robes, gazes towards Christ with expressions of awe and reverence. The scene likely represents Christ's power over evil or a specific miracle where he vanquishes a demon or heals someone afflicted by a demonic presence.",
