    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel, with blonde hair and blue wings, dressed in a white robe, reaches out to a bearded man in a green tunic and a purple cloak. The man has his hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a stone tower with arched openings is visible. To the right, two men in medieval attire, one wearing a blue and red hat and the other a green cap, observe the scene. The ground is depicted as green grass with some golden accents, suggesting an outdoor setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a divine intervention or a moment of spiritual revelation, possibly related to a saint or a biblical figure receiving a message or protection from an angel.
