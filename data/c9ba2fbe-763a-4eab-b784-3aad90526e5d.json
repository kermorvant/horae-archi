    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an outdoor pastoral setting with two shepherds tending to a flock of sheep. One shepherd, on the left, wears a red tunic and blue hose, holding a spear. The other shepherd, on the right, is dressed in a blue tunic and red hose, also holding a spear. A dog lies in the foreground, and a flask rests on the ground. In the background, a simple barn with a red roof is visible, along with a fence and some distant buildings. Above, an angel with outstretched wings descends, carrying a scroll that reads \"GLORIA IN EXCELCIS\". The landscape is lush with trees and greenery. This scene illustrates the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a key event in the Nativity narrative, where angels proclaimed the birth of Christ to humble shepherds.",
