    "scene_description_enriched": "A funeral procession is depicted outdoors, with a group of figures in clerical attire, including a bishop or high-ranking cleric in a blue cope adorned with gold floral motifs, leading the procession. They are accompanied by other clergy and laypeople, some with hands clasped in prayer. In the foreground, a man in a red tunic and blue cap is tending to a shrouded body being placed into a grave, which is surrounded by a decorative black netting. In the background, a walled structure and trees suggest a cemetery or sacred ground, with a small building, possibly a chapel or mausoleum, visible to the right. The scene likely represents a burial service, a common devotional theme in Books of Hours, emphasizing mortality and the hope of resurrection.",
