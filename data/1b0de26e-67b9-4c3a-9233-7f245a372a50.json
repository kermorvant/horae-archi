    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the biblical story of David and Goliath. A young David, clad in a blue tunic and a brown cloak, stands to the left, preparing to throw a stone from a sling. He holds a staff in his other hand. Facing him, the giant Goliath, armored in ornate gold and blue attire with a feathered helmet, is struck in the forehead by a stone and recoils in pain, his hand raised to his wound. A red shield lies on the ground near David. In the background, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills and a distant castle, suggesting an outdoor setting for this epic confrontation.",
