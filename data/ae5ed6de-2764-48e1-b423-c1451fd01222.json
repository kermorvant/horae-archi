    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a baptismal font where several nude figures, likely representing souls or the newly baptized, are being immersed. On the left, a bearded male figure with a halo, possibly representing John the Baptist or Christ, gestures towards the figures in the font. On the right, another haloed figure, possibly Christ, pours water from a vessel onto the heads of some of the figures. Above, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, is visible, with a hand emerging from a cloud, suggesting divine intervention. The background is dark and patterned, with decorative borders framing the scene.",
