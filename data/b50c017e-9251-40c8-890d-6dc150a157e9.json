    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in a purple robe and a distinctive hat, gesturing with his right hand and pointing upwards with his index finger, while his left hand is open. He stands on a patterned red carpet. Before him, a bearded man in royal attire, including a blue robe and a crown on a cushion, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. Behind the kneeling man, a golden, ornate architectural structure with pointed arches and decorative tracery is visible. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and distant buildings is depicted under a blue sky. A divine figure, possibly God or a prophet, is shown in the upper part of the scene, emanating rays of light towards the praying man. A harp lies on the floor in the foreground.",
