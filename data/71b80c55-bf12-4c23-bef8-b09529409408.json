    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures are depicted in a scene that appears to be indoors, possibly within a building. In the foreground, a man in a blue tunic and brown hose looks upwards with his arms outstretched. Behind him, several other figures are visible, some with halos, suggesting a religious context. One figure, centrally placed and also with a halo, wears a blue garment with gold stripes. The overall impression is of a devotional scene, possibly depicting a moment of prayer, supplication, or a biblical event.",
