    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman kneels in prayer, her hands clasped before her chest. She wears a golden headdress and a blue and white garment over a flowing golden skirt. Behind her, a dark, stylized tree or structure with intricate detailing is visible. To her right, two figures lie prostrate on the ground, one on his back with an arm raised, and the other bent over. The scene is set in a grassy landscape under a dark, possibly stormy sky. The presence of the kneeling figure in prayer and the fallen figures suggests a narrative of divine intervention or a plea for help during a time of distress, possibly related to a saint's martyrdom or a biblical event.",
