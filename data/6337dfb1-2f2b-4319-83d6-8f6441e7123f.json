    "scene_description_enriched": "A saintly figure, identified by a triple tiara and halo, stands on the left, gesturing with his right hand. He wears a red cloak over a blue robe adorned with gold trim. In the center, a sleeping man with long hair and a beard lies on the ground, his head resting on his hand. To his right, a woman with long blonde hair, her hands clasped in prayer, is depicted. Behind them, a white unicorn with a single horn is visible, along with a golden deer with antlers and a dark, furry creature resembling a dog or bear. The scene unfolds in a lush, green forest setting with blue foliage in the background. The presence of Adam and Eve, a unicorn, and a saintly figure suggests a narrative related to the Fall of Man and its redemption.",
