    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded figure, crowned and robed in red, sits on a golden throne, holding a globe surmounted by a cross and raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing or pronouncement. Before him kneels a crowned woman in a blue robe, her hands clasped in prayer. The scene is set against a radiant yellow background, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The figure on the throne represents God the Father, and the kneeling figure is likely the Virgin Mary, in a depiction of the Coronation of the Virgin or a similar devotional scene.",
