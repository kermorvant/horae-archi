    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Jesus Christ, identifiable by his halo, interacting with a kneeling supplicant. Jesus, with a beard and long hair, is gesturing with his right hand and pointing with his left. The supplicant, dressed in simple robes, kneels with hands clasped in prayer or supplication. Behind Jesus, two other figures are visible, one with a beard and halo, suggesting they are also important religious figures. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch, with decorative foliage. Behind the figures, a structure with windows and what appears to be a roof is depicted. This scene likely represents a moment of healing or intercession, possibly the healing of the blind man or a similar miracle, where Jesus grants a request.",
