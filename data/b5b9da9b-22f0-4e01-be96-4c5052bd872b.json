    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in an outdoor setting with a river and castles in the background. On the left, a woman in a purple habit and black veil holds a red book. In the center, a person wearing a red hood and a gold and blue tunic gestures with their right hand. To the right, a child in a gold tunic and blue stockings kneels on a path, holding a spoon. The background features rolling hills, trees, a river, and several fortified castles. The entire scene is framed by a decorative arch.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely a depiction of the Miraculous Draught of Fishes, where Christ (represented by the child, possibly in a symbolic representation of his divine nature or youth) performs a miracle for his disciples. The woman with the book could represent a follower or witness, and the central figure might be an apostle or another disciple. The castles in the background suggest a worldly setting, contrasting with the divine intervention.",
