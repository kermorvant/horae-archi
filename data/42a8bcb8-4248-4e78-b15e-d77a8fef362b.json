To her right, the Angel Gabriel, identified by his wings and white robe adorned with gold trim, kneels and presents a scroll. The background features a stone wall and a window showing a stylized landscape with a small figure and a cross. Above the window, two figures in regal attire are visible. The floor is decorated with a geometric pattern of red, green, and blue squares. The overall scene is framed by a golden border.",
