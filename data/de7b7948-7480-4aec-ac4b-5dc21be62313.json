    "scene_description_enriched": "A person wearing a blue and gold patterned mantle over a white tunic and a blue cap is depicted inside a large wooden barrel, appearing to be working with their hands. To the right, several wooden barrels are stacked, one with a lid. The scene takes place within a dimly lit interior space with wooden walls and a tiled floor. The overall impression is of a domestic or workshop setting related to storage or production.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a secular activity, possibly related to the production or storage of goods like wine or ale, or perhaps a domestic chore. Without further context from the manuscript, a specific religious or biblical interpretation is not possible.",
