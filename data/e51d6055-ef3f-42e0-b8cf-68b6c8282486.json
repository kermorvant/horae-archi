    "scene_description_enriched": "Three nude women with long, flowing red hair are depicted in a circular, gold-leafed frame, surrounded by stylized red flames. The woman on the left reclines, looking upwards with her mouth open. The central woman kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. The woman on the right kneels, covering her breasts with her arms. The scene is framed by a large, ornate blue initial 'D' with decorative elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the souls of the damned in Purgatory or Hell, suffering the torments of fire. The women's postures suggest supplication and suffering.",
