In the foreground, a man with a white beard and wearing a yellow tunic is tending to a bare-branched shrub. Behind him, another man in a blue tunic and pink hose swings a scythe. Further back, two other men, one in a pink tunic and the other in a gold tunic, are also working the land with tools. In the middle ground, several buildings with red roofs are visible, nestled among trees. In the background, a fortified castle or town sits atop a hill, bathed in golden light. The sky is a pale blue with streaks of gold.",
