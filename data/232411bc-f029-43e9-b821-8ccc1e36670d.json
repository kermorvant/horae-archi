    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel kneeling on the left and the Virgin Mary kneeling on the right. The angel, with feathered wings and a halo, points a golden staff towards Mary. He is dressed in a golden robe. Mary, also with a halo, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a blue mantle over a grey dress. Behind her is a red canopy with gold trim, and to her right, a book rests on a green-covered table supported by stacked books. Above the angel, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The background suggests an interior space with a stone wall and a tiled floor.",
