    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of monks, some wearing black habits and hoods, are gathered around a richly decorated lectern. One monk, distinguished by a more ornate black and gold cope over his white alb, stands prominently, looking upwards and singing from a large illuminated book placed on the lectern. Behind him, several other monks also appear to be singing or chanting, their faces turned upwards. In the foreground, a wooden structure, possibly a choir stall or a decorated bench, is visible, covered with a red textile adorned with floral and avian motifs. The background features a patterned tapestry or wall with a geometric design of gold, blue, and red squares. The scene depicts a liturgical service, likely a choir chant or psalmody, within a religious setting.",
