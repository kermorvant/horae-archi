    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine event with multiple figures. At the center, a figure, likely Christ, is shown kneeling or prostrating, with a radiant light emanating from above. Above this central figure, winged beings, possibly angels or seraphim, are depicted, some with animalistic features like bird heads. Surrounding the central figure is a crowd of people, many with beards and wearing crowns or elaborate headdresses, some with their hands clasped in prayer or awe. The overall impression is one of a celestial manifestation or a moment of divine revelation.",
