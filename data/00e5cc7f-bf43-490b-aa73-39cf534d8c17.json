    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an elderly man with a long white beard, dressed in a blue robe with gold embellishments and a red cloak, kneeling with his hands clasped in prayer. He is positioned in front of a red curtained canopy. To his right, a smaller figure, possibly a prophet or an angel, is seated on clouds, gesturing with one hand. Between the kneeling man and the seated figure is a censer emitting smoke. The background suggests an interior space with architectural elements like columns and a patterned wall, framed by an arched opening.",
