    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded, elderly man with a halo stands in a landscape. He wears a blue tunic and an orange cloak draped over his left shoulder and arm. He holds a long staff in his right hand. His left hand rests on his hip. The background depicts a body of water with a sailing ship and a smaller boat. In the distance, on the right, a city with towers and walls is visible. The sky is a pale blue with some clouds. The scene is likely a depiction of a prophet or saint, possibly Saint Paul, given the common iconography of a staff and journeying attire, set in a coastal landscape with a distant city, suggesting travel or a vision.",
