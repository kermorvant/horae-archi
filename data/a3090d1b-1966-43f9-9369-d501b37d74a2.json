    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an outdoor setting, suggested by the presence of foliage and a patterned background that could represent a garden or courtyard. In the center, a woman with a halo, possibly representing a saint or a significant biblical figure, is engaged in conversation with two other women. One of these women holds a basket, and the other appears to be gesturing. To the right, another figure, also possibly female, carries a chest. Behind the central figures, architectural elements are visible, including a column with a decorative capital and what seems to be a large urn or vessel. The overall composition suggests a narrative scene, possibly from a biblical story or a devotional text.",
