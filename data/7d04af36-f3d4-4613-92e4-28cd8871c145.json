Below, in a grassy landscape dotted with trees, two shepherds are depicted. One shepherd, wearing a blue tunic and a red cloak, leans on a staff and looks upwards. Another shepherd, dressed in a pink garment, is seated on the ground, looking up with his hand raised. Several sheep are scattered around the landscape, and a dog sits near the seated shepherd. The background features a patterned textile-like sky.",
