    "scene_description_enriched": "This image depicts a decorative border with stylized foliate motifs and two animalistic figures on either side. The central element is a large, stylized flower or bud, from which curved, leafy tendrils emerge. On the left, a creature resembling a lion or a dog is depicted in profile, with its forelegs raised. On the right, a similar creature is shown, also in profile, with its body facing left. The overall impression is one of ornamental design rather than a narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is a decorative border, likely from a Book of Hours, and does not depict a specific religious or biblical scene. The stylized animals and foliage are common decorative elements in medieval manuscripts, often used to frame text or illuminations.",
