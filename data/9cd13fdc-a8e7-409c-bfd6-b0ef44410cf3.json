    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman bathing in a stone basin, with her legs submerged in water. She is dressed in a red gown with white sleeves and a white headdress. To the left, a king with a crown and beard looks out from a window of a dark, multi-towered castle. A river flows past the castle. In the background, another king, also crowned and robed, stands with his hands clasped in prayer, facing a mountainous landscape under a blue sky. The overall composition suggests a narrative event, possibly related to a biblical or hagiographic story.",
