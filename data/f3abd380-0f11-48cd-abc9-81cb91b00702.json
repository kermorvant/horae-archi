    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of monks and nuns gathered around a catafalque, which is adorned with a rich, patterned textile and topped with numerous candles and crosses. The figures, all dressed in black habits, appear to be engaged in a solemn ceremony, possibly a funeral or a requiem mass. Some are reading from books, while others gaze towards the catafalque. The architectural setting is a Gothic interior, characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and traceried windows, suggesting a church or chapel. The overall atmosphere is one of mourning and religious devotion.",
