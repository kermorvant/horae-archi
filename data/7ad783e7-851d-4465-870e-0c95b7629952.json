    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a rural landscape with several figures engaged in agricultural labor. In the foreground, two individuals, likely peasants, are shown working. The person on the right wields a sickle, appearing to cut crops, while the person on the left carries a long pole. Behind them, another figure is visible, also seemingly involved in fieldwork. In the background, a building with a pitched roof and windows is depicted, suggesting a rural dwelling or farmstead. Above the figures, a circular medallion contains an image of a fish and a scorpion, possibly representing astrological signs or a symbolic motif. The overall setting is an outdoor agricultural field, with hints of rural architecture.",
