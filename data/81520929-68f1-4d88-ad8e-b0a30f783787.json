    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a halo and flowing hair, cradles the Christ Child, who is also haloed. They are seated upon a crescent moon, surrounded by a golden mandorla radiating light. Two angels attend them: one on the left plays a pipe, and another on the right plays a harp. The background is a starry blue sky, with hints of green landscape at the bottom. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative floral motifs.",
