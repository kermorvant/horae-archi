    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth. His body is emaciated and shows wounds. To the left of the cross stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle over an orange robe, with her hands clasped to her chest in sorrow. To the right stands a female figure, likely Mary Magdalene, in a pinkish-purple mantle over an orange robe, also with hands clasped. The cross is set against a gold background with a pattern of small circles and diagonal lines, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting. At the foot of the cross, a skull is visible, symbolizing Golgotha, the place of the skull. The scene is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs.",
