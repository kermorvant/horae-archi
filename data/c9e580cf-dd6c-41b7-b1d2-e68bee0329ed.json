He is shown in the act of harvesting a field of golden wheat, holding a sickle in his right hand and grasping a bundle of wheat stalks in his left. The background is a vibrant blue sky, and the scene is framed by a golden archway, suggesting an architectural context. The overall impression is one of agricultural labor, likely representing a scene from the liturgical calendar or a devotional theme related to harvest.",
