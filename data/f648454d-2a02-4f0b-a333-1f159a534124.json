    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, identified as David, kneels in prayer outdoors, facing a distant landscape dotted with buildings. He wears a red tunic with a fur-lined collar and a blue cloak. His hands are clasped, and his head is tilted upwards. Beside him lies a blue hat adorned with a feather. In the sky above, an angel descends, radiating light, holding a skull and a branch. In the background, a tall, conical monument stands to the left, and rolling hills recede into the distance, featuring scattered settlements and a prominent church spire. This scene depicts David in prayer, receiving a divine message or vision from an angel, likely representing a moment of repentance or prophecy.",
