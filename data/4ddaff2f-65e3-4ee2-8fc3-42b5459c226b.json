    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bathing woman, likely Bathsheba, in a pool of water, attended by a servant offering a bowl of fruit. Above them, a king, possibly David, observes from a window, while in the background, a battle scene unfolds. The architecture is ornate, with Gothic tracery and decorative elements framing the different vignettes. The overall composition suggests a narrative of temptation and its consequences.",
