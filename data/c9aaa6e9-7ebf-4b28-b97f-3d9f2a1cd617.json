    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary stands with her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a halo and a richly patterned robe. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, flies above her. To her right, the Angel Gabriel, also with a halo, gestures towards Mary, holding a staff. Both figures are positioned on a checkered floor. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior space, with arches and columns visible. A book rests on a stand near the Virgin Mary. The overall composition is framed by an ornamental border.",
