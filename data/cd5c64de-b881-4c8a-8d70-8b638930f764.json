    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a grand, vaulted interior that resembles a cathedral or large church. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large, red-lined wings and a golden staff, appears to be delivering a message to the Virgin Mary. He is dressed in a white robe with a red cloak. On the right, the Virgin Mary kneels, her hands crossed over her chest, her head bowed, and a book open before her. Above them, a cherubic figure descends from the upper part of the scene, and a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, is depicted within a golden disc. The architecture features tall columns, arches, and windows, suggesting a sacred and imposing space.",
