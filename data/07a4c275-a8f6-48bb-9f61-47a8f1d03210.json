    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two nude figures, a man and a woman, embracing in a body of water. The man's arm is around the woman's shoulder, and they are looking at each other. Behind them, a river flows towards a distant landscape featuring a fortified castle or city with towers and crenellations. The entire scene is framed by an elaborate architectural border with decorative elements and inscriptions. The figures' embrace and the setting suggest a scene of intimacy or perhaps a biblical narrative related to water and salvation.",
