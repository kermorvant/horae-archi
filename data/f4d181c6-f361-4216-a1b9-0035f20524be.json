    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures seated around a table, engaged in a meal. The central figure, radiating a halo, appears to be Christ, with long hair and a beard, holding a loaf of bread. To his left and right are two other figures, also bearded and wearing robes, who are reaching for or holding food. The table is covered with a striped cloth and set with cups and bread. The background is a stippled pattern, suggesting a divine or ethereal setting. This scene is likely an illustration of the Supper at Emmaus, where Christ reveals himself to his disciples after his resurrection.",
