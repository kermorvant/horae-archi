    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross, his body rendered in a pale, emaciated style. Two angels, one on each side, kneel on ornate platforms, their faces turned towards Christ. They are depicted with wings and wear simple white robes. Behind Christ, a dark, architectural structure rises, suggesting a tomb or altar, with decorative elements. The overall setting is framed by an arched border with decorative motifs. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic style, typical of early manuscript illumination.",
