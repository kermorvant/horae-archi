    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and halo, is shown seated or kneeling on a raised platform, her hands raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers above her. Facing her is the Angel Gabriel, kneeling and gesturing towards her, holding a scroll with Latin text. Behind the Virgin, a vaulted ceiling with blue and gold decoration is visible, along with arched windows. To the right, a divine figure, likely God the Father, is depicted in a radiant halo, observing the scene. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. The overall composition suggests a sacred event taking place in a richly decorated interior.",
