    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint George on horseback, clad in golden armor, piercing a dragon with his lance. The dragon, coiled on the ground, appears to be wounded. In the background, a woman in a golden dress kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, facing away from the central action. Above and behind her, a formidable castle stands on a rocky outcrop, overlooking a mountainous landscape. The entire scene is framed by ornate, gilded architectural elements, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
