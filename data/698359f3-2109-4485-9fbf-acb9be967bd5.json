    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned figure, likely King David, kneels in prayer. He wears a fur-trimmed mantle and a jeweled crown, and his hands are clasped in supplication. Behind him, an arched architectural structure with columns and a vaulted ceiling is visible. To his right, a harp stands upright. The scene is framed by an ornamental border. The figure's posture and the presence of the harp suggest a devotional context, possibly representing David's penitence or his musical praise of God.",
