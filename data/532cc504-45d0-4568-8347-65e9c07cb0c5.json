Three Magi are present: one kneels before the Virgin and Child, offering a gift; another stands behind him, holding a vessel; and a third stands to the left, also holding a vessel. The background shows a brick wall and a window, suggesting an interior setting, possibly a stable or a humble dwelling. The figures are rendered with distinct facial features and wear medieval attire. The kneeling Magus is adorned in a red robe with ermine trim, indicating his royal status.",
