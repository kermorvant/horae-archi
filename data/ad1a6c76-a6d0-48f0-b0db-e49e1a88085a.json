    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a decorative border with stylized foliage, flowers, and two figures. On the left, a human-like figure with a somber expression is seated, hunched over, with hands clasped. To the right of this figure, a mythical bird, possibly a phoenix or griffin, is shown perched. The overall composition is framed by a horizontal border, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript or printed book.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene does not depict a specific biblical or devotional event. The figures and motifs are likely ornamental, possibly representing allegorical concepts or simply decorative elements common in medieval art.",
