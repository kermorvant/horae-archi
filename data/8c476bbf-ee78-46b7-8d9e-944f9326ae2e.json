    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, dressed in a grey robe and blue mantle, kneels in prayer on a patterned green floor. He is positioned in what appears to be a domestic interior, with a bed frame to his right and a table covered with a striped cloth to his left, upon which rests a golden object. Behind him, a rich tapestry or wall hanging is visible. Through an architectural opening, a landscape unfolds with rolling green hills, trees, and a distant walled city. Above, a divine figure, possibly God or an angel, is depicted within a blue cloud, radiating light.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a moment of prayer or divine revelation, possibly related to a biblical figure or a saint. The presence of the distant city and the divine figure suggests a vision or a prayer for intercession. Given the context of a Book of Hours, this could represent a specific psalm or devotional text.",
