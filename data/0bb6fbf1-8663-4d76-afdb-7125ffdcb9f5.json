    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a domestic interior, likely a bedroom, where a woman in white habit and veil, with hands clasped in prayer, is attended by another woman in a green garment. They are positioned near a bed draped with rich red and gold fabric. In the foreground, a cleric in white vestments holds a golden object, possibly a chalice or reliquary, towards the seated woman. Another man in white and a cap stands behind the cleric. The room features a tiled floor and a patterned tapestry or wall hanging.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Last Rites or a devotional moment for a dying or seriously ill person, possibly a noblewoman given the rich furnishings. The presence of the cleric with a sacred object suggests a religious ceremony. The woman in white habit could be a nun or a devout laywoman. The overall atmosphere is one of solemnity and spiritual preparation.",
