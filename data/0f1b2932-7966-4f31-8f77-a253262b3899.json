    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an oval frame adorned with chains and flames. On the left, an elderly man with a long white beard and flowing orange robe holds a large stone tablet, likely representing the Ten Commandments. He points to it with a wooden staff. To the right stands a younger man, depicted in a blue tunic with red trim and a red cape, wearing a sword at his hip. He holds a scroll. Above them, a radiant sun with a human face shines down. The overall composition suggests a theme of divine law and earthly authority, possibly illustrating a biblical or moralistic narrative.",
