    "scene_description_enriched": "The image is a black and white reproduction of a portrait, likely a miniature, depicting a young woman from the chest up. She has elaborate, curly hair styled with delicate ornamentation. She wears a pearl necklace and a richly adorned dress with a low neckline, embellished with jewels and intricate trim. The portrait is framed within an oval border against a dark background, suggesting it is a standalone depiction rather than part of a larger narrative scene.",
