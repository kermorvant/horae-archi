    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a scorpion, rendered in a stylized manner, positioned centrally within a decorative border of foliage. The scorpion's body is elongated, with its segmented tail curled upwards. Its legs are splayed outwards, and its pincers are visible. The surrounding foliage consists of delicate branches with small leaves, creating a naturalistic yet ornamental frame for the creature. The overall composition is contained within a dark, possibly gilded, background, suggesting an illuminated manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Scorpions in medieval art often symbolized danger, sin, or the devil due to their venomous sting. In the context of a Book of Hours, such an image might serve as a memento mori, a reminder of mortality and the need for spiritual vigilance, or it could be part of a bestiary or allegorical representation of vices.",
