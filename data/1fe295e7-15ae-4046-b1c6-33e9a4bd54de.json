    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with white wings and a golden halo descends from a patterned sky, holding a scroll that reads \"Gloria in excelsis Deo\". Below, on a green, grassy hillside dotted with small red and white flowers, a shepherd in a red cloak and pink tunic reclines, his head resting on his arm. Another figure, possibly a shepherd or an angel, stands to the right, dressed in blue and wearing a pinkish-red scarf, touching his head. Several sheep graze peacefully on the hillside, and a small dog is visible near the reclining figure. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
