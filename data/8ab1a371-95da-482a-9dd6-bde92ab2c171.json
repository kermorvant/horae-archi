    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, two figures are depicted. On the left, a figure in a blue robe stands, with a red element suggestive of fire or drapery at their feet. This figure appears to be gesturing or offering something to the figure on the right. The figure on the right is seated, wearing a pinkish robe, with a beard and long hair. They are holding an object in their hands. The background is a neutral, textured surface, with some areas of gold leaf visible, suggesting a decorative or precious context. The overall scene is somewhat damaged and faded.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a biblical or hagiographic event. The figure in blue could represent an angel or a divine messenger, and the red element might symbolize the Holy Spirit or divine intervention. The seated figure with a beard could be a prophet or a saint. Without more context or clearer iconography, a definitive interpretation is difficult, but it evokes a moment of divine communication or revelation.",
