    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A bearded man in a red and green robe, wearing a tall white mitre, holds the Christ Child, who is swaddled and has a halo. To the right, a woman in a blue mantle, presumably the Virgin Mary, kneels and reaches out towards the child. Behind her, another woman holds a basket containing doves. A man in a gold tunic stands behind the Christ Child, holding a long staff. The architectural setting is suggested by a richly decorated canopy above the bed and an arched doorway in the background. The scene is framed by ornate gold tracery and a decorative border with fleur-de-lis motifs.",
