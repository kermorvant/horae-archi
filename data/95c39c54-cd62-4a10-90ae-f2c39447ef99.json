    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. Christ's body, showing stigmata, lies in a sarcophagus. The Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue and with hands clasped in sorrow, leans over him. To her left, a man in a yellow tunic and green hat looks on with concern. To the right, another man in a green robe and pink hat, possibly Joseph of Arimathea, is shown preparing to wrap the body, with a bell hanging from his belt. The background is a rich, patterned gold, suggesting a divine or sacred setting, with green foliage visible at the bottom.",
