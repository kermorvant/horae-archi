    "scene_description_enriched": "Two youthful figures, each with a halo, stand facing each other, separated by a vertical element that appears to be a cross. The figure on the left wears a red tunic and a green mantle, holding a wreath of leaves with both hands. The figure on the right wears a dark garment and a pink mantle, holding a staff or rod and looking downwards. The background is a rich gold leaf, typical of medieval manuscript illumination, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The scene likely depicts a moment of spiritual significance, possibly related to martyrdom or a saintly encounter.",
