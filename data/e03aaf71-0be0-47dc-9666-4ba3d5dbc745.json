    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of four men, three in blue robes and one in a pinkish-red robe, are gathered together, appearing to be in mourning or deep contemplation. The central figure, an older man with a white beard, is embraced by two younger men. A fourth man stands to the right, also in a blue robe, leaning in towards the central figure. Above them, golden rays descend from a starry blue sky, illuminating a patterned background of red, blue, and gold squares. A book lies open on the green ground in the foreground. The scene likely depicts a moment of profound grief or spiritual revelation, possibly related to the death of a significant figure or a divine visitation.",
