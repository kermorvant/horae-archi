    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two distinct areas. On the left, a bearded man, identified as David, kneels in prayer before an open book on a lectern. He wears a royal blue robe adorned with gold fleurs-de-lis and a golden clasp, and a crown or headdress. His hands are raised in supplication. Behind him, large arched windows reveal a landscape. The right side of the image depicts an urban setting with various buildings. In the foreground, a person plays a large musical instrument, possibly an organ. Above and behind this, several figures are visible in windows of different structures, including a tower with a blue conical roof and a larger building with multiple windows. One window shows several figures looking out, and another shows a single figure. The overall impression is a juxtaposition of private devotion and public life within a medieval cityscape.",
