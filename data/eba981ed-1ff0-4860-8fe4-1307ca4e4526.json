    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a skeletal figure, representing Death, confronting a richly dressed man. Death, with exposed ribs and a skull for a head, holds a torch aloft, its flame illuminating the scene. The man, wearing a feathered cap, tunic, and cloak, appears to be holding a sword or dagger. Both figures are positioned within an architectural frame that includes decorative elements resembling flames and skulls, suggesting a somber or cautionary theme. The overall composition evokes a Dance of Death motif, where Death claims all individuals regardless of their social standing.",
