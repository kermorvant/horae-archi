Saint Christopher, a large, muscular figure, is dressed in a blue tunic and white undergarment, with a red cloak draped over his shoulders. He leans on a tall staff, his gaze directed upwards towards the child. The Christ Child, with a halo, sits on Christopher's shoulder, holding a globe and raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing. The water is depicted with stylized blue waves, and the background features a green, hilly landscape with trees and distant buildings. The entire scene is framed by an illuminated border.",
