    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural setting that suggests a divine or sacred space. On the left, a bearded man, possibly a prophet or saint, is dressed in an orange robe and holds a circular object containing a lamb. He has a halo, indicating his sanctity. On the right, an angelic figure with wings, also with a halo, is dressed in a blue robe and holds a chalice containing a bird. The background features a rich tapestry-like pattern of gold diamonds on a reddish-brown ground, interspersed with small white and orange motifs. Elaborate gold architectural elements, resembling Gothic tracery and canopies, frame the figures. Below the angel, a white bird is depicted. The overall impression is one of solemnity and spiritual significance, likely representing a biblical or devotional narrative.",
