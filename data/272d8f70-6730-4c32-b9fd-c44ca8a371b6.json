    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, holding a golden orb topped with a cross, bestowing a blessing upon the Virgin Mary, who kneels with clasped hands and wears a crown. To the left, an angel with wings and a halo stands behind the Virgin, seemingly placing or adjusting her crown. Behind them, a canopy-like structure is visible, adorned with a blue drapery and a red background filled with numerous figures, possibly representing a heavenly host. The figures are set against a green drapery, and the entire scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
