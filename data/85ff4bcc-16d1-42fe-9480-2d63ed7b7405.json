    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a tranquil seascape with rolling waves under a sky transitioning from yellow to blue. In the distance, rugged blue mountains rise from the water, with hints of structures or rock formations on their slopes. The foreground features a sandy shore with sparse vegetation and a dark, rocky outcrop on the right. A lush green tree with delicate leaves is visible on the right side, partially obscuring the mountainous landscape. The entire scene is framed by a decorative, golden cartouche and draped with pink fabric at the top, suggesting it is an illustration within a larger work, possibly a Book of Hours.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a landscape, possibly evoking a biblical narrative or a devotional theme related to nature's beauty and divine presence. Without specific figures or clear narrative elements, it could symbolize a moment of contemplation, a journey, or a spiritual retreat in a natural setting.",
