    "scene_description_enriched": "A kneeling woman, clad in a pale blue robe and white wimple, raises her hands in supplication. Facing her is a figure with a halo, holding a book in one hand and a palm frond in the other, suggesting martyrdom. The background is a decorative tapestry of alternating blue and red squares with gold accents, framed by an ornate, quatrefoil-shaped border with red and blue detailing. The scene is set within a stylized, abstract architectural framework.",
