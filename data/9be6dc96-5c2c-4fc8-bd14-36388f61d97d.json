    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and red undergarment, holding the Christ Child. Mary's hands are clasped in prayer or adoration, and she gazes downwards. The Christ Child, depicted as a nude infant, is seated and appears to be reaching towards his mouth. They are framed by a large, stylized blue and pink floral or drapery element against a gold background. The overall impression is one of tender maternal devotion and divine presence.",
