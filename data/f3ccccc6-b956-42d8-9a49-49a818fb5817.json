    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael, identifiable by his wings and sword, in combat with a multi-headed, demonic creature. Saint Michael, dressed in a red and blue patterned tunic and hose, wields a sword above his head, poised to strike. He is also holding a cross on a string, which is being inserted into the mouth of the demon. The demon, depicted as a grotesque beast with multiple heads, horns, and bat-like wings, lies on the ground, seemingly defeated. The background is a rich, patterned tapestry in red and gold, with a green, grassy ground populated by stylized plants. The overall composition suggests a divine battle against evil.",
