    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint John the Baptist by his halo and traditional depiction, kneels in a grassy landscape. He wears a red cloak lined with gold over a simple garment, exposing his legs. His left hand is open, palm up, while his right index finger points upwards towards a radiant sun. Beside him lies an open book, its pages filled with text. In the upper right corner, a lamb is depicted within the sun's rays, symbolizing Christ. The scene is set outdoors with rolling green hills and a few trees in the background under a blue sky. The overall composition suggests a divine revelation or vision.",
