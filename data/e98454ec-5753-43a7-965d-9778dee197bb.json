    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a man with a beard and a turban, seated and with his hands clasped in prayer. He is positioned in front of a textured background that suggests foliage or a decorative element. To his right, architectural elements are visible, including what appears to be a tower or a section of a building with arched openings and decorative molding. The overall style is that of a woodcut or engraving, typical of early printed Books of Hours.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's posture of prayer and the presence of architectural elements suggest a devotional scene, possibly representing a saint, a prophet, or a devout individual engaged in prayer. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific biblical or hagiographic interpretation is not possible, but it clearly conveys a moment of religious contemplation.",
