    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two distinct vignettes framed by decorative arches. In the left vignette, a seated figure, possibly a woman, is shown under a tree with abundant foliage. An angel with outstretched arms appears to be communicating with her. In the right vignette, another angel, holding a book, stands in a landscape with a suggestion of hills or clouds. The background in both vignettes is filled with stippling, suggesting a starry or celestial sky. The overall composition suggests a narrative of divine communication or revelation.",
