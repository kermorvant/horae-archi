    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a celestial or heavenly scene, with multiple tiers of figures. The uppermost tier shows rows of winged beings, possibly seraphim or cherubim, depicted as abstract forms with wheels. Below this, three oval-shaped compositions each contain a group of three standing figures, also with wings, and wheels at their base. The lowest tier presents groups of human figures, appearing as saints or holy individuals, dressed in medieval attire. The overall impression is one of divine hierarchy and celestial beings.",
