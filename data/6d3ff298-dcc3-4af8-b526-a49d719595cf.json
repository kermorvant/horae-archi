    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, with the Virgin lying on a blue-draped bed, appearing to be in a state of repose or death. A bearded man, possibly a priest or bishop, stands at her head, holding a cross-like object and extending his hand. To his left, another figure with a halo and a brown cloak prays. In the foreground, a kneeling figure in a white robe with a halo prays with clasped hands. To the right of the bed, three figures with halos and praying hands are gathered, one in a purple robe and two in orange and purple robes. The background is a solid blue, suggesting an interior or a stylized setting, with a hint of architectural detail at the top left.",
