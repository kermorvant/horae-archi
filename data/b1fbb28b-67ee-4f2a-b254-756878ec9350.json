    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Virgin Mary, haloed and dressed in blue, is seated and reading from an open book placed on a lectern draped with a red cloth. To her right, the Archangel Gabriel, with large red wings and wearing a pink cloak over white garments, kneels and extends his hands, holding a scroll with text. Above Gabriel, a dove descends, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. In the upper right corner, a bearded figure, likely God the Father, blesses the scene. The background features a brick wall and a patterned textile, suggesting an interior setting. The floor is decorated with a geometric pattern.",
