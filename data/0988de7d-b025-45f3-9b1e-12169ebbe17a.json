    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Baptist, identifiable by his halo and beard, carrying a large wooden cross. He is unclothed, with his body rendered in pale tones. To the left, a figure in a dark monastic habit, possibly a monk or hermit, gestures towards John the Baptist with an outstretched hand, while a white scroll unfurls from the cross. Below the monk, two figures in similar monastic attire are kneeling and bowing their heads in reverence or supplication. The background is a rich red, textured with gold leaf suggesting clouds or a divine presence, from which golden rays emanate downwards. The foreground is a grassy, green landscape with small blue flowers.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents Saint John the Baptist, possibly in the wilderness, with his iconic cross. The presence of monks suggests a devotional context, perhaps illustrating a vision or a moment of spiritual encounter with the saint. The unfurling scroll could symbolize his preaching or a divine message.",
