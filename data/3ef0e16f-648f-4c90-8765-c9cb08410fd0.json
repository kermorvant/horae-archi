    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross as the central figure. To the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, is supported by another figure in red, likely Saint John the Evangelist. To the right, a group of men in elaborate attire, possibly Roman soldiers or onlookers, are present. One man in a blue and gold patterned robe and a tall conical hat stands near the cross, holding a spear. Another man in a blue robe with gold stars and a yellow turban-like hat looks towards the cross. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible, set against a green landscape with scattered trees. The sky is a vibrant blue.",
