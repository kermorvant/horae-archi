    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist on Patmos, seated outdoors by a river, writing on a scroll. A griffin or eagle stands beside him. In the background, a vision unfolds within a golden, arched frame. This vision includes a celestial realm with the Virgin Mary in an oval frame, an angel, and a red dragon. Below this, a procession of figures, some on horseback, travels along a river. Further in the distance, a city with towers and a bridge is visible, along with ships on the water. The left side of the vision shows a king seated on a throne with a lamb, attended by an angel and other figures, possibly representing Old Testament prophecies or heavenly visions.",
