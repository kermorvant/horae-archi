    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, identified as Saint Agnes, stands holding a white cloth. Beneath the cloth, the severed head of a young man with long blond hair and a beard is displayed. Saint Agnes wears a white headdress and a reddish-brown cloak over a blue garment. A halo surrounds her head, and a white ribbon unfurls from her headdress. The background depicts a stylized landscape with green fields and blue, cloud-like forms against a light blue sky. This scene likely represents the martyrdom of Saint Agnes, a young Christian saint known for her purity and faith, who was martyred in the 4th century. The severed head is that of her suitor, who was killed after she refused his advances.",
