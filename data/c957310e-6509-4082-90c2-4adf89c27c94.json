    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, haloed and wearing a blue mantle over a brown dress, approaching Elizabeth, who is kneeling and wearing a red dress and blue veil. Elizabeth's hands are extended towards Mary, and her expression suggests emotion. Behind Mary stand two figures, one a bearded man in a brown hooded robe, and another younger figure. The background features rocky terrain and a distant castle on a hill, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall composition is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs.",
