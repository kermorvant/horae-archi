    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an oval frame adorned with flowers and ribbons. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, dressed in a golden tunic and purple leggings, is shown with wings, gesturing towards the Virgin Mary. He holds a staff. On the right, the Virgin Mary, clad in a red dress and blue mantle, looks down with her hands crossed over her chest, a halo around her head. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a yellow sky. The background is a soft gradient of grey and yellow, suggesting a divine or ethereal setting. Below the oval, a scroll-like cartouche contains inscribed text in French.",
