    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as St. John the Baptist by his halo and devotional posture, kneels in prayer outdoors. He wears a simple, rough-spun golden robe over a white undergarment. His hands are clasped, and his gaze is directed upwards. To his right, a tree trunk bears a small shrine containing a depiction of the Crucifixion. In the background, a building with a pitched roof and arched windows is visible, along with rolling hills and a blue sky. A red cloth, possibly a cloak, is draped over the tree.",
