    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure with a halo, depicted with wavy hair and a serene expression, is shown holding a small, coiled serpent in their left hand. In their right hand, they are holding a large bird of prey, possibly an eagle or a griffin, perched on their arm. The figure is draped in classical-style robes. Below the figure, a banner displays text in Gothic script. The overall scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching for shading. The presence of the halo suggests a saintly or divine figure, and the animals may be symbolic attributes.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Saint John the Evangelist with his symbol, the eagle, and possibly representing the serpent in the chalice, a common attribute associated with him, symbolizing his victory over poison or heresy. The text below, \"Desire estre prest en enfer ou ab/sconfe,\" translates to \"Desire to be present in hell or absent/confessed,\" which could relate to themes of salvation, temptation, or the saint's intercessory role.",
