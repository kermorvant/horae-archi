    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, crowned and seated on an orange throne, embracing the Christ Child. Mary wears a blue tunic and a grey mantle, while the Christ Child is dressed in an orange garment. The background is a red tapestry with a geometric pattern. The figures are enclosed within an ornate, circular frame with decorative elements on the sides, including what appears to be a profile of a bearded head on the right. The overall composition suggests a devotional image of the Madonna and Child.",
