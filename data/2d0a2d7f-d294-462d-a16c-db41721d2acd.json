    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross in the center. He is wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth. To his left kneels the Virgin Mary, her hands clasped in prayer, draped in a blue mantle over an orange robe. To his right stands a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also with hands clasped, wearing a similar blue mantle over an orange robe. The background is a vibrant blue sky with golden streaks, suggesting clouds or divine light, and a green landscape with sparse trees. The entire scene is framed by an ornamental border with floral motifs.",
