    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, is depicted seated and engaged in writing. They hold a quill in their right hand, poised over an open book. The figure wears a blue mantle over a grey tunic, both adorned with gold embellishments. To the left, a monstrous, furry creature with a human-like face sits beside the figure. Behind them, a Gothic window with tracery reveals a blue sky. The background features a red, patterned fabric on the right and a dark, architectural element on the left.",
