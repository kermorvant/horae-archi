    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Resurrection of Christ. Christ, with a halo and wounds visible on his body, emerges triumphantly from an ornate sarcophagus, holding a banner with a red cross. An angel with fiery wings hovers nearby, looking towards Christ. Below, a bearded figure in regal attire, possibly a king or a Roman soldier, lies prostrate on the ground, his crown fallen beside him, suggesting the vanquishing of earthly power by divine resurrection. The background transitions from a rocky landscape to a celestial blue sky.",
