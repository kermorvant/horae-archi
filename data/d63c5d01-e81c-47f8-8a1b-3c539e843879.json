    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed monk, dressed in a dark habit with gold trim, stands holding an open book in his left hand and a crozier in his right. He is depicted within an architectural frame that suggests an archway or niche, with decorative elements and a carved face above. The background is a blue sky with distant hills and trees, indicating an outdoor setting. The monk's gaze is downcast, suggesting contemplation or prayer. The inscription above the arch is partially obscured but appears to contain Latin text. This scene likely depicts a saintly figure, possibly a bishop or abbot, engaged in scholarly or pastoral duties.",
