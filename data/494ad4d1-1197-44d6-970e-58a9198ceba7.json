    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two male figures in elaborate religious vestments standing in a verdant landscape. On the left, a bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, presides over three nude individuals submerged in a wooden tub. The bishop's right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or authority. To the right, another cleric, possibly a priest or deacon, holds an open book and appears to be reading or preaching. The background features a decorative, tessellated pattern of blue and gold squares, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The overall composition evokes a scene of spiritual intervention and salvation.",
