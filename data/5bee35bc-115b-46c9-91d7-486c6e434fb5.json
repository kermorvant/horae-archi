    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and beard, carrying a large wooden cross. He is dressed in a white robe with purple undertones and is barefoot. The scene is set in an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, sparse vegetation, and a cluster of tall, slender trees on the right. In the background, distant buildings, possibly castles or churches, are visible on hilltops. The ground is rendered with textured lines, suggesting a hilly terrain, and scattered rocks and plants. The overall impression is one of Christ's solitary journey, likely towards his crucifixion.",
