    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descending from a light-filled sky. The dove has its wings spread and is depicted with a halo of rays emanating from its head, and red eyes. Below the dove, a vast expanse of water is rendered with horizontal lines, dotted with small, dark marks. Several rocky islands or landmasses emerge from the water, painted in earthy tones of brown and gold. In the background, rolling hills are depicted in soft blues and yellows, suggesting a distant landscape. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements in gold, blue, and red.",
