    "scene_description_enriched": "The upper register depicts a scene of mockery and torment. A central figure, likely Christ, is seated on a red bench and is being crowned with thorns by two individuals. One figure to the left, dressed in blue, appears to be kneeling and looking up, while another in red gestures upwards. To the right, a figure in green places a crown of thorns on Christ's head, and another figure holds a bundle of branches or reeds. The lower register shows a figure, also likely Christ, bound to a post, with a halo indicating divinity. One man in blue is striking him with a club, while another in orange appears to be mocking or pushing him. The background is a plain gold, suggesting a divine or symbolic setting.",
