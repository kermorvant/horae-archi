    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable structure, characterized by a golden, angled roof and dark walls. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is kneeling and praying before the Christ Child, who lies naked on a blue cloth on the ground. To the left, Saint Joseph, an elderly man with a white beard, is seated, holding a staff and looking towards the infant. Behind them, the head of a donkey is visible. In the background, a stylized cityscape with towers and buildings is rendered under a blue sky with golden rays descending, suggesting divine light.",
