    "scene_description_enriched": "A kneeling figure, likely a monk or nun due to the white habit and tonsure, prays with clasped hands, holding a staff topped with a golden, ornate crook. Above and to the left, a vision appears in the sky: the Virgin Mary, crowned and holding the Christ Child, is depicted with rays of light emanating from them. The background is a landscape with rolling green hills and distant, stylized buildings that suggest a town or city. The scene is framed by decorative borders, with gold leaf accents throughout.",
