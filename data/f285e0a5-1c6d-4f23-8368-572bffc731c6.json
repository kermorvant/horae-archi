    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, a group of figures are gathered around a table. At the top center, a woman with long hair, possibly the Virgin Mary, is depicted with her hands raised, seemingly in prayer or supplication. To her right, another figure leans back, also with hands raised. Below them, several other figures are seated, some with their hands raised in a similar gesture. The table is laden with what appear to be dishes or food items. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching for shading. The overall impression is one of a communal gathering, likely with a devotional or religious significance.",
