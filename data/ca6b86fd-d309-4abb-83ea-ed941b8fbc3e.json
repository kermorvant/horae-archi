    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within a church interior. A priest, identifiable by his halo and ornate vestments, stands before an altar, his hands clasped in prayer. On the altar are an open book, a chalice, and a crucifix housed in an elaborate niche. To the left, a choir of four young boys, dressed in white surplices with blue and red trim, stand behind a wooden choir stall, their mouths open as if singing. The architecture features pointed arches and tall windows, suggesting a Gothic style. A green canopy with gold trim hangs above the altar area. The overall impression is one of solemn devotion and liturgical practice.",
