    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ, set within a rustic stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue mantle over a red tunic, gazes down at the Christ Child, who lies on a striped mat on the ground. A donkey stands to the left, and an ox is positioned behind Mary. To the right, an elderly man with a beard, dressed in a red robe, leans on a staff, observing the scene. Behind him, a younger figure in a grey tunic and red hood holds a staff. The background features a green landscape with rolling hills, trees, and large rock formations, under a blue sky with a stylized cloud or celestial element.",
