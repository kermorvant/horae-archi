    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned figure, likely King David, kneels in prayer with hands clasped. He wears a blue mantle over an orange tunic and has a long, grey beard. Behind him, a harp stands upright. Above and to the right, a celestial vision depicts a youthful figure, possibly Christ Child or an angel, seated on clouds and gesturing with one hand while holding a small orb in the other. The background is a rich red tapestry pattern, with dark blue, abstract shapes suggesting a landscape or drapery. The scene is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs and a bird on the left.",
