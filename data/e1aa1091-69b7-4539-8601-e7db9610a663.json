    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man, identified as Saint Luke by the presence of his symbolic ox, is depicted writing in a manuscript. He wears a pink robe and a distinctive red, white, and blue hat. He is seated at a desk, with an inkwell and quill in hand, diligently working on a scroll. Behind him, the ox's head is visible, looking towards the viewer. To the left, a shelf holds two books. To the right, a window with diamond-shaped panes looks out onto a green, patterned surface. A blue book with a yellow spine rests on the desk in the foreground.",
