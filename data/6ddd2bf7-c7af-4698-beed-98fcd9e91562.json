    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a complex architectural setting with multiple levels and figures. In the upper register, within ornate Gothic niches, are several figures. On the left, a bishop-like figure stands, holding hands with a kneeling figure in a star-patterned robe. To the right of this interaction, within another niche, a woman holds a child, possibly the Virgin Mary and Christ Child, with another figure behind her. Further to the right, a seated figure, likely a saint or prophet, holds a book and gestures upwards. The lower register shows a group of figures on a paved ground level, with a man in a turban-like hat speaking to a woman and two other women behind her. A grand staircase with brick walls and stone steps leads up to the upper level. The overall impression is one of religious narrative unfolding within a highly stylized, architectural framework.",
