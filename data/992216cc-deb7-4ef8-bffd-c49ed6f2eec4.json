    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around the Virgin Mary, who is kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer. Above them, a dove descends from a golden sky, with rays of light emanating downwards. The figures, all with halos, appear to be the Apostles, some holding books. The ground is rendered as a black and white checkered pattern. The overall impression is one of spiritual significance, with the divine presence indicated by the dove and golden background.",
