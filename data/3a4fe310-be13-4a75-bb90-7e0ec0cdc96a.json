    "scene_description_enriched": "A young woman with long blonde hair, wearing a reddish-brown tunic and a blue mantle with gold trim, is depicted holding a grey tower. The tower has a conical roof and appears to be made of stone. The background is a pale blue sky with some distant green hills and trees. The woman's gaze is directed downwards and slightly to the side, with a melancholic expression. This iconography is strongly suggestive of Saint Barbara, a Christian martyr often depicted with a tower, her attribute, symbolizing her imprisonment by her pagan father.",
