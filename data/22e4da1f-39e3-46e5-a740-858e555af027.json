    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and bearing wounds from the Passion, standing within a golden mandorla against a checkered background of blue and gold squares. He is draped in a blue mantle, revealing his torso with visible wounds, including the stigmata on his hands and side. A serpent coils around a branch near his left hand, and a sword pierces his side. Above and around him, several figures, possibly angels or souls, are depicted in various poses, some reaching upwards. Below, small, nude figures emerge from a green landscape, also reaching towards Christ. The overall impression is one of divine suffering and redemption.",
