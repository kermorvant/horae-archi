    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures, depicted as male with long hair and beards, are seated side-by-side. They are all wearing blue cloaks over white tunics and ornate golden circular brooches at their necks. The central figure holds open a book with text, while the figure to its left gestures with an open hand, and the figure to its right rests its hand on the book. They are seated on a golden background with radiating lines, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting. Below them, a band of red forms a fiery or cloud-like base, populated by small, indistinct figures, possibly angels. The overall composition evokes a representation of the Holy Trinity.",
