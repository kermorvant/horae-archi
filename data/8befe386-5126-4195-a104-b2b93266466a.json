    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, including at least two women and several men, gathered under an arched architectural structure. The central figures are a woman in the foreground, facing left, and a child to her left, also facing left. Both are dressed in medieval attire. Behind them, other figures are visible, some wearing hats. The architectural element above them appears to be a decorative arch with intricate detailing, possibly suggesting a canopy or a stylized representation of a building's interior.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene's interpretation is uncertain due to the limited detail and lack of clear iconography. However, the grouping of figures, particularly the woman and child, could suggest a devotional scene, perhaps related to the Virgin Mary and Christ Child, or a scene of prayer or supplication. The presence of multiple figures might also indicate a narrative scene from the Bible or a saint's life.",
