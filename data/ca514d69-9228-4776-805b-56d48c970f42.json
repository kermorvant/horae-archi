    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial gathering centered around the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child. Above them, God the Father, depicted as an elderly bearded man with a halo and rays of divine light, blesses the scene and holds a golden orb and cross. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers between God the Father and the Virgin Mary. Surrounding the central figures are numerous saints and holy figures, all with golden halos, some wearing crowns, indicating their elevated status. The figures are arranged in concentric semi-circles, suggesting a divine assembly. The lower part of the image shows a pale, reptilian creature with red flames emanating from its mouth, possibly representing evil or a defeated foe. The overall composition is framed by decorative borders with foliate motifs.",
