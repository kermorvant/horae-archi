    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely the Virgin Mary, kneeling and looking upwards towards a radiant light source from which rays descend. She holds an open book in her lap and her left hand is raised. To the left, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is shown descending with outstretched wings. The background is rendered with hatching to suggest foliage or a natural setting, with some indistinct forms that could be interpreted as trees or rocks. The overall composition suggests a divine visitation or inspiration.",
