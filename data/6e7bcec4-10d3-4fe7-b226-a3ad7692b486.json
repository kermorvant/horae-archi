    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a prophet or biblical figure, is depicted wearing a brown tunic and a red outer garment with darker red stripes. He has a crown or headdress on his head and long, wavy blue hair. He holds a scroll in his hands, which unfurls to reveal Latin text. The background is a vibrant blue with white cloud-like shapes. The scene is framed by decorative foliage and floral elements, suggesting it is an illustration within a manuscript.",
