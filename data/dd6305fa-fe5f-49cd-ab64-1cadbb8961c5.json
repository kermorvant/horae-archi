    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue and white, cradles the Christ Child who is adorned with a halo. Three Magi are present: one kneels before the child, offering a chalice; another kneels, holding a golden vessel; and a third, dressed in orange, stands and holds a golden vessel and a lamp. A group of onlookers stands in the background, observing the scene. Behind them, a stone wall with crenellations suggests a city setting. To the right, a wooden structure with a thatched roof provides shelter. An elderly man in a blue robe stands near the entrance of this structure, looking towards the main event. The overall setting is a blend of outdoor elements like the city wall and sky, and a partially enclosed architectural space.",
