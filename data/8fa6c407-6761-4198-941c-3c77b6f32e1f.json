    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures against a blue, sky-like background. The figure on the left, wearing a reddish-brown cap and a dark grey tunic, appears to be a young man. He holds a white scroll or band in his left arm and gestures with his right hand. The figure on the right, an older man with a long white beard and wearing a reddish-pink cloak over a blue garment, also holds a white scroll or band. Both figures have halos, suggesting they are saints or biblical figures. The overall impression is one of a spiritual or prophetic encounter, possibly involving a divine message conveyed through the scrolls.",
