    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, all with golden halos, are depicted looking upwards with their hands raised. At the top center, a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from a blue sky, radiating golden light in diagonal lines. The figures are dressed in robes of blue, orange, and green. One central figure, likely the Virgin Mary, is dressed in blue and has her hands clasped. The scene is set against a background of golden rays emanating from the dove, suggesting a divine event. There is no discernible architecture or specific setting, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the moment.",
