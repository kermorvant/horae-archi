    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border with botanical motifs and a stylized bird, possibly a swan, rendered in black ink on parchment. The border features a large flower at the top and another at the bottom, with a sinuous stem and leaves connecting them. A bird with a long, curved neck and a small head is depicted in the middle section. The overall style is illustrative and appears to be part of a larger manuscript, likely a Book of Hours, given the presence of text in columns to the right of the illustration.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The botanical elements and the bird likely serve as decorative elements within a devotional text, possibly symbolizing purity, grace, or the beauty of creation. Without further context or identifiable religious figures, a specific biblical or liturgical scene cannot be determined.",
