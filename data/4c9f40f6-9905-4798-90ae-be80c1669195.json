    "scene_description_enriched": "Two men, wearing helmets and tunics, are carrying a large cluster of grapes on a pole. They are depicted in profile, facing each other. Behind them, stylized architectural elements suggest a city or town with buildings featuring pitched roofs and arched windows. The scene is framed by decorative borders, and the overall impression is one of labor or harvest.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents the spies sent by Moses to scout the land of Canaan, as described in the Book of Numbers (13:23). They returned with a cluster of grapes so large that it had to be carried on a pole between two men, symbolizing the fertility and abundance of the Promised Land.",
