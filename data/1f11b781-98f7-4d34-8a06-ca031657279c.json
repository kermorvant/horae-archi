    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a saint or holy figure, is depicted wearing a dark monastic robe and a golden halo. He holds an open green-covered book in his left hand and appears to be reading or contemplating it. The figure is framed by a Gothic-style window with blue sky visible through its panes. Behind the figure, a decorative tapestry or fabric with gold scrolling patterns on a dark red background is visible. Below the figure, architectural elements suggest a niche or a balcony with decorative moldings and what appear to be miniature arches.",
