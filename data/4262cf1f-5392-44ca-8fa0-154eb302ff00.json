    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting that suggests a church or chapel interior. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, identifiable by his wings and halo, kneels and presents a scroll to the Virgin Mary. He wears a golden robe over white undergarments. The Virgin Mary, also with a halo, kneels on the right, dressed in a blue robe, with her hands clasped over her chest and holding an open book. Behind them, an altar-like structure is visible, with steps leading up to it, and a red book rests on a lower step. The architecture features pointed arches, ribbed vaults painted in red and green, and columns. The overall scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
