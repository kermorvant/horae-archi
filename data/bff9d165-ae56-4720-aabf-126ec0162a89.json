She has long, dark hair and wears a flowing pink gown with gold embellishments at the hem and a black band around her waist. Her hands are clasped in front of her. Behind her, a dark forest with slender trees is visible, rendered with gold accents. The ground appears to be water or a marshy area, also decorated with gold lines. The overall scene suggests a contemplative or perhaps melancholic moment in nature.",
