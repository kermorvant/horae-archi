    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures seated within an architectural structure that appears to be a canopy or a niche. On the left, a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is shown kneeling, her head bowed and hands clasped over her chest, wearing a crown. On the right, a bearded man, presumably Christ, is seated, holding a globe in his left hand and raising his right hand with two fingers extended in a gesture of blessing or teaching. The background features a decorative textile or tapestry with arched motifs. The overall setting suggests a devotional or theological representation.",
