    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude woman with long, auburn hair stands in a body of water, holding a white cloth in each hand, from which water is being wrung out. Her eyes are closed, and she wears a dark necklace with a pendant. To her right, a blue garment is draped over the bank. In the background, a king wearing a crown and royal attire observes the scene from an arched loggia supported by columns. The setting is an outdoor garden with lush green foliage, a fountain on the left, and a brick wall behind the trees.",
