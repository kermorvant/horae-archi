    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and purple robe, interacting with a group of figures. To Christ's left, Saint Peter, also with a halo and clad in gold and blue, gestures towards a pale, emaciated figure reclining on a green and white striped surface, draped in white cloth. This figure appears to be the subject of Christ's attention. Behind Peter and Christ, a crowd of men with halos look on, some with hands raised in gestures of awe or supplication. In the background, a distant landscape with hills and a building is visible under a blue sky with golden rays descending from above. The overall impression is one of a miraculous healing or resurrection.",
