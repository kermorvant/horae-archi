    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child, who also has a halo. Joseph, with a beard and wearing a hooded cloak, walks beside the donkey, guiding it with a stick. In the background, a flock of sheep is tended by a shepherd, and further in the distance, a fortified city with towers and crenellations is visible on a hill. The landscape is green and hilly, with scattered trees and a rocky outcrop.",
