    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a circular frame. On the left, a bearded figure, likely Christ, stands holding a staff and wearing a robe. His halo suggests divinity. He is reaching towards the right. On the right, a woman, possibly Mary Magdalene, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, also with a halo. She is looking towards the figure on the left. Behind them, a curtain or drapery is visible, suggesting an interior setting. The overall composition evokes a devotional encounter, possibly the Noli me tangere, where Christ appears to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection.",
