    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the body of Jesus, bearing wounds from crucifixion, laid out on a stone slab. Several figures surround him, expressing grief. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, clasps her hands in prayer. Another woman, possibly Mary Magdalene, in a red garment, leans towards Christ. Other figures, including men in elaborate headwear and robes, are also present, some appearing to support or mourn. The setting is outdoors, with a rolling green landscape and a single tree in the background under a blue sky. A decorative stone structure, possibly a tomb or bier, is visible beneath Christ's body.",
