    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, adorned with a floral wreath on his head and a flowing turban, stands with a serious expression. He wears a richly decorated tunic with a scalloped collar and a belt featuring circular ornaments. His left hand points forward, while his right hand holds a sickle-like tool. The background is sparsely decorated with circles, suggesting a stylized or abstract setting. The figure's attire and the presence of the tool might allude to a specific role or allegorical representation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's attributes, particularly the beard, turban, and the tool resembling a sickle, strongly suggest the representation of a prophet or a figure from the Old Testament, possibly associated with harvest or judgment. Without further context from the manuscript, a definitive interpretation is challenging, but it aligns with common iconographic representations of figures like Isaiah or Jeremiah, or even a personification of a virtue or concept.",
