    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identifiable by his halo and his act of writing in a book, seated on a rocky, island-like outcrop surrounded by water. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a red cloak, with curly blond hair. To his left, a small, horned demon lurks, representing temptation or worldly distractions. To his right, a large eagle, the traditional symbol of Saint John, is perched, holding a scroll or quill in its beak. The background features a blue sky with scattered stars and stylized trees on rocky terrain, suggesting a remote and contemplative setting. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative floral motifs.",
