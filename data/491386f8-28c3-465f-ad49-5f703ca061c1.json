    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures stand within an interior space. The figure on the left wears a green tunic, a red hat, and a draped reddish garment over his shoulder. He holds a glass bottle aloft in his right hand. The figure on the right wears a red surcoat over a blue tunic and green hose, and holds a brown vessel in his left hand and a knife in his right. Behind them is a wooden bench with decorative carvings and a blue cushion. A window with multiple panes is visible in the background. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern of pink, blue, and white squares. Both figures have halos, suggesting they are saints. The scene likely depicts a moment related to the saints' lives, possibly involving the dispensing of a medicinal or sacramental substance.",
