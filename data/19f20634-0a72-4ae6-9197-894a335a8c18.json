    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious narrative within an architectural setting. On the left, a figure in elaborate attire, possibly a king or dignitary, is shown. To the right of this figure, a woman, identifiable as the Virgin Mary by her halo and devotional posture, is seated and reading from an open book. She is engaged in conversation with a bearded man, likely Christ, who is gesturing with his hands. On the far right, another figure, also in regal or important attire and wearing a distinctive hat, is present. The figures are framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior space with arched openings and decorative details.",
