    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, identified as Saint Margaret of Antioch, kneels in prayer, holding a cross. She is depicted with long, flowing hair and is dressed in a simple robe. To her left, a monstrous creature, likely a dragon or a demon in disguise, is shown with its mouth open, biting at a cloth. The background is filled with a dotted pattern, suggesting a celestial or spiritual realm. Above the figure, an architectural element resembling an arch frames the scene, with decorative elements on either side. The presence of the dragon is a key iconographic element associated with Saint Margaret's legend.",
