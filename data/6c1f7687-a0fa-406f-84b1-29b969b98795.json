    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned man, identified as King David, kneels in prayer with his hands clasped before him. He wears a blue robe with gold trim and a red cloak. Beside him rests a golden harp. Above him, an angel, depicted in orange with wings spread and holding a sword, descends from the sky. The scene is set outdoors with a walled enclosure and a river in the background, beyond which are buildings with towers and crenellated roofs. The architecture includes a pink stone structure with an arched opening and decorative niches, and further back, a fortified complex with circular towers and rectangular buildings.",
