    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with hands clasped in prayer and a halo, is seated on a donkey. Before her lies the Christ Child, depicted as an infant. Behind Mary, Joseph is shown holding a candle, illuminating the scene. The figures are situated within a rudimentary architectural structure, possibly a stable, suggested by the presence of beams and a wall-like element behind Joseph. The overall composition is rendered in a woodcut style with strong linework.",
