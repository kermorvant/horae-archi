    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a turban-like headdress. He has curly hair and a long, flowing beard. His attire includes a richly decorated garment with a beaded collar and a tunic with buttons. The figure is rendered in a woodcut style, with strong lines and hatching to create shading. The background is largely abstract, with curved lines suggesting drapery or a stylized environment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's attire and headdress suggest a historical or biblical figure, possibly a prophet or a king from the Old Testament, or a figure from classical antiquity. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific scene interpretation is not possible.",
