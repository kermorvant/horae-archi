The Virgin Mary, depicted kneeling with clasped hands in prayer, is being crowned by both God the Father (on the left, wearing a bishop's mitre and robes) and Christ (on the right, depicted as a beardless youth). Above them, the Holy Spirit is represented by a dove descending, radiating golden light. The figures are seated or kneeling on clouds, surrounded by smaller cherubic figures with wings. The background is a radiant gold, suggesting a divine and heavenly setting. The overall composition emphasizes the divine investiture of Mary as Queen of Heaven.",
