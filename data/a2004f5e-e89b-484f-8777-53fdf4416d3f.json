    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and devotional attributes, stands in a room with a checkered floor. She wears a blue tunic, a red mantle, and a white headdress. In her right hand, she holds a sword, and in her left, a small, grey, house-like reliquary. Beneath her feet lies a brown, beast-like creature, possibly a lion or dragon, symbolizing the vanquished evil. The background suggests an interior space with a doorway opening to a landscape with rolling hills and trees. The scene is framed by decorative borders typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
