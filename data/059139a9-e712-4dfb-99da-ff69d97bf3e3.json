    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child, in a red tunic, reaches towards a golden chalice offered by one of the Magi who is kneeling. Two other Magi stand behind, one in a red robe holding a golden vessel, and another in a red and blue tunic holding a reliquary. The figures are positioned within a simple wooden stable structure, with a red patterned cloth visible behind the Virgin. In the background, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills, trees, and a fortified city with towers and crenellated walls under a starry blue sky. The overall scene is framed by a decorative border with floral motifs.",
