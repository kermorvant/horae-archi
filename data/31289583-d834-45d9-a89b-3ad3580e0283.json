    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child reaches out towards the kneeling Magus. Two other Magi stand behind, one offering a chalice and the other holding a similar vessel. They are presented with gifts, likely gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Behind them, a simple, rustic shelter with a thatched roof is visible. The background features rolling hills, a prominent rocky outcrop, and a sky illuminated by golden rays emanating from a sun-like source. The scene is framed by a decorative border with floral motifs.",
