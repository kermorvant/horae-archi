    "scene_description_enriched": "A demonic figure with dark, feathered skin, sharp claws, and a horned head kneels on the left, reaching out to grasp a white cloth that is being pulled away from a couple embracing. The couple, a man in a blue tunic adorned with gold patterns and a woman in a pink gown, are shown in an intimate embrace, their faces close together. They are positioned under a rustic, thatched-roof structure supported by wooden beams. The background features a vibrant red tapestry-like pattern with scattered gold and white cloud-like motifs, suggesting a stylized or symbolic setting. The ground is depicted as green grass with tufts of vegetation. The scene likely represents the temptation of the couple by the devil, symbolizing the struggle against sin and worldly desires.",
