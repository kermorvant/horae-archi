    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, an angel, likely Gabriel, points towards the Virgin Mary on the right. The angel wears a reddish-brown robe and has red lips and blonde hair. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and a gold-patterned dress, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer and her head bowed, her expression conveying humility and acceptance. Above and behind the angel, a white dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The background suggests an architectural setting with a golden arch and drapery, hinting at a divine or sacred space.",
