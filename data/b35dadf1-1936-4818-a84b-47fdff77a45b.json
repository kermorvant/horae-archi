    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure lying on a bed, with their eyes covered by another figure who appears to be an angel, indicated by the presence of wings. A third figure, to the left, also reaches towards the eyes of the reclining figure. The background suggests an architectural setting with columns and what might be a wall or battlement. The reclining figure is dressed in a blue garment with gold accents, lying on a red bedspread adorned with gold motifs. The overall impression is one of distress or perhaps a spiritual vision being obscured.",
