    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, seated and holding the Christ Child, who is reaching for an apple offered by his mother. The Virgin Mary is dressed in a blue mantle and gown, with a golden patterned tapestry behind her. Above them is a red canopy adorned with gold lettering and fringe. To the right, a man in a black robe with his hands clasped in prayer gazes towards the Virgin and Child. Behind the figures are windows with diamond-shaped panes, suggesting an interior setting. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene, likely a private prayer or contemplation.",
