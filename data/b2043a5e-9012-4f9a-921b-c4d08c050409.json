    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her golden halo and blue mantle, meeting Elizabeth, who is older and wears a white veil and a dark robe. Their hands are clasped in a gesture of greeting and recognition. Behind them, a lush, rolling landscape unfolds, dotted with trees and leading to a body of water with a sailboat. In the distance, a prominent castle with multiple towers and red roofs stands against a blue sky, suggesting a secular setting for this sacred encounter. Another, more distant city or fortress is visible on a hill across the water.",
