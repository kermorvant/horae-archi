    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary kneeling on the left, her hands clasped in prayer, before a seated figure on the right, who holds a globe and raises a hand in blessing. The seated figure is likely God the Father, indicated by the presence of a crown above and a dove descending from above, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The background is a rich tapestry of gold foliage against a black ground. To the left, a red-backed chair with gold trim is visible, suggesting an interior setting. The figures are rendered with halos, signifying their divine or saintly status. The overall composition evokes a sense of divine revelation or judgment.",
