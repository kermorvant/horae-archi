    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large, colorful wings, approaches the Virgin Mary. He holds a lily and a scroll inscribed with \"NE MAR[IA] GRATIA PLENA\". The Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, descends from a cloudy sky towards Mary. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is shown kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer, her head bowed, and a halo around her head. She is seated on a red cushion. Behind her, a book lies open on a golden surface, and a richly draped curtain hangs. The setting appears to be an interior space with a tiled floor and a view of a distant landscape through an arched opening.",
