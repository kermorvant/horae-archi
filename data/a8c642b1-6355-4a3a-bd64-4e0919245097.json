The Christ Child reaches out towards a golden box of gifts presented by one of the Magi, who is kneeling. Two other Magi stand behind, one holding a golden vessel and the other holding a crown. They are in a rustic setting, with a thatched roof structure behind them and a landscape with hills and trees in the background. A star with golden rays shines above the structure. A crown lies on the green ground in the foreground.",
