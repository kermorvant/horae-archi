    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a maritime setting with two ships. The larger ship in the foreground is brown and has a mast with rigging. A single figure, possibly a sailor or a passenger, is visible in the center of this ship, appearing to be seated. To the right, a smaller, less detailed ship is also depicted, with a mast and what appears to be a cross-like structure at its top. The background is a vibrant blue, suggesting the sea and sky, with some golden areas on the right edge that might represent land or a decorative border. The overall style is rudimentary, characteristic of some medieval manuscript illuminations.",
