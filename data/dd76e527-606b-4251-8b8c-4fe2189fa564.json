    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely a prophet or scribe, seated at a desk and reading from a scroll. He wears a cap and a robe, and has a halo, suggesting a figure of importance. To his right, a winged figure, presumably an angel, kneels with hands crossed over its chest, looking towards the man. The setting appears to be an interior space with a window in the background. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine revelation or inspiration.",
