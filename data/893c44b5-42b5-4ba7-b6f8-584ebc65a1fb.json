    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral procession outside a church. Several figures in black monastic habits are gathered on the left, facing a group of clergy in white albs and blue copes. Two clergy members are holding an open book and a censer, suggesting a religious rite. In the foreground, a man in a red garment is supporting a body wrapped in white cloth, seemingly carrying it towards the church. The architecture visible is a church with a pitched roof, arched windows, and a prominent gable. The sky is a deep blue with scattered gold stars, and the ground is green grass. The overall impression is one of solemnity and religious observance.",
