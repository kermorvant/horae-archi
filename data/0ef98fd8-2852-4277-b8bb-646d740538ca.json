    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pietà, with the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and veil, cradling the lifeless body of Christ. Christ's body, marked by wounds and blood, is draped across her lap. He is partially covered by a white loincloth. Behind them, a green, hilly landscape is visible, with trees and distant mountains. To the right, a stylized depiction of a church with a tall spire rises against a blue sky. The composition is framed by a golden border.",
