    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and wearing a halo, kneels in adoration. To her right, a figure in a pink garment with a red cap gestures outwards. In the background, a donkey and an ox are visible, suggesting the traditional elements of the Nativity. The stable itself is a simple wooden structure with a thatched or wooden roof, open to a pastoral landscape with rolling hills and trees under a blue sky. A small, pale figure, possibly the Christ Child, is visible near Mary's feet.",
