The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies on a straw-filled manger. To the left, Saint Joseph, dressed in an orange robe, also kneels with hands joined in prayer. A cow and an ox are present, looking towards the infant. The stable structure is partially visible, with a wooden roof and stone walls. Beyond the stable, a landscape with trees and a body of water is suggested.",
