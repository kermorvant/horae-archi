    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a highly ornate, pink Gothic architectural setting. On the left, the Archangel Gabriel, with large green wings and a golden, jeweled robe, kneels and presents a lily to the Virgin Mary. He holds a scroll. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe and with a golden halo, kneels on a checkered floor, holding an open book. Behind them, the architecture features numerous arches, columns, and niches filled with statuary, suggesting a church or a grand religious edifice. In the background, a cityscape with towers and spires is visible under a sky with celestial elements. The scene is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs and birds.",
