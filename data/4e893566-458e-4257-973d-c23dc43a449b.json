    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and veil, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching out. To the left, a woman in a red dress carries a basket with doves. Facing them is an elderly man, likely a priest, wearing a white miter and a blue and gold robe, holding a green cloth over a white-covered surface, possibly an altar or a table. Behind him, a richly decorated canopy is visible. The background shows architectural elements including arched windows with tracery and a patterned wall. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. The scene is framed by an arched border with floral and gold leaf decoration.",
