    "scene_description_enriched": "Four women are depicted, each wearing a veil or head covering and long robes. Their hands are clasped together in the center of the composition, suggesting a moment of prayer, supplication, or shared devotion. The style is characteristic of woodcut illustrations, with bold outlines and hatching to indicate form and shadow. No architectural elements or specific setting are visible, focusing entirely on the figures and their interaction.",
