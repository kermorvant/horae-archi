    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Coronation of the Virgin Mary, a common theme in medieval art. The Virgin Mary, depicted kneeling with hands clasped in prayer, is crowned by Christ. She is dressed in a flowing white robe, and a halo encircles her head. Christ, seated and wearing a crown and a regal robe, extends his right hand towards Mary's head, bestowing the crown. Behind them, three angels are visible, two looking towards the central figures and one holding a crown. The figures are set within an architectural framework suggesting a divine or heavenly space, with arched structures and decorative elements.",
