    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. In the foreground, a person rides a donkey, holding a candle. To their right, another figure, possibly a monk due to their habit, gestures with open hands. Behind them, several other individuals are visible, some looking towards the central action. Above, a figure in a halo holds a chalice and a cross, suggesting a religious context. The architecture appears to be a simple, arched structure, possibly a gateway or a niche, with decorative elements at the top. The overall impression is one of a religious procession or a scene from a biblical narrative.",
