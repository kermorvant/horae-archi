    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female figure, likely a saint or queen, stands holding an open book in her left hand and a sword in her right, its hilt resting on the ground. She wears a golden crown and a blue robe over a white garment, with a red mantle lined in gold. A golden halo encircles her head, and rays emanate from it. The background is a simple blue sky with hints of green landscape at the bottom. The figure's posture and attributes suggest a depiction of a holy woman, possibly a martyr or a queen renowned for her piety and strength.",
