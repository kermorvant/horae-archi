    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, presumably Christ, is depicted carrying a large wooden cross. He wears a red tunic and a blue mantle lined with gold. The scene unfolds in a hilly, green landscape dotted with trees. In the background, a pink walled city with towers and blue domes is visible. The figure's gaze is directed downwards, and his expression suggests weariness or contemplation.",
