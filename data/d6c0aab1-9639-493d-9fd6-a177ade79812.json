    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Resurrection of Christ. Christ, with a halo and a cross visible within it, stands triumphantly emerging from an open sarcophagus. He is draped in a blue tunic and a pink mantle, holding a banner with a red cross on a white field. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or command. Below the sarcophagus, three Roman soldiers, clad in armor and helmets, are depicted asleep or stunned, one wearing a red cap. The background is a rich gold, with stylized trees and rocky formations on the left. The sarcophagus is ornate, with a decorative frieze and a white cloth inside.",
