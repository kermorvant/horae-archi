    "scene_description_enriched": "A saintly figure, likely a bishop given the mitre and crozier, stands within an arched architectural setting. The figure holds an open book in their left hand and a crozier in their right. They are adorned in ornate vestments, including a richly patterned cope. Behind the figure, a patterned tapestry or wall hangs, and to the left, an arched opening reveals a landscape with buildings and trees. The floor is tiled in a geometric pattern. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
