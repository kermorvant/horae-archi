    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer, looking down at the Christ Child lying in a manger. The Christ Child is also depicted with a halo and is swaddled. To the right, Saint Joseph, also with a halo, kneels in prayer. Behind them, a donkey and an ox are visible. The figures are positioned within a rudimentary stable structure, suggested by wooden beams and a thatched roof. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible, set against a landscape with trees. Two figures in red hats and tunics are looking over a wall in the middle ground.",
