    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, wearing a crown and a long robe over a blue tunic, kneels in prayer outdoors. His hands are clasped, and his gaze is directed upwards. Behind him, a stone wall encloses a courtyard. In the middle ground, a fortified building with a domed tower stands beside a body of water crossed by a bridge. Further in the distance, a procession of figures on horseback moves across a landscape. The sky above is filled with a turbulent, dark cloud formation from which a colossal, bearded figure emerges, suggesting a divine or supernatural presence.",
