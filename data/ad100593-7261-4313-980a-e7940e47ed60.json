    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve, naked and ashamed, are being driven out by an angel wielding a flaming sword. In the foreground, a bearded man, likely representing God or a divine messenger, gestures towards them. Behind Adam and Eve, a winged, demonic figure is visible near a tree bearing fruit, possibly representing the serpent or temptation. The background features a walled city with towers and crenellations, suggesting a transition from the idyllic garden to the fallen world. A swan is depicted in the water near the city walls.",
