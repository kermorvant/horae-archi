    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a solitary, elderly man with a long white beard, kneeling with his hands clasped in prayer. He is partially submerged in a reddish-brown body of water, suggesting a baptismal or penitential act. In the background, three young men in blue and gold tunics and blue caps are playing musical instruments: one plays a pipe, another a lute, and the third appears to be holding a bagpipe. Behind them, a ruined architectural complex with crumbling walls, arches, and a tower suggests a once-grand structure, possibly a church or castle, now in disrepair. The overall atmosphere is one of spiritual reflection and perhaps a contrast between worldly pursuits (music) and spiritual devotion (prayer).",
