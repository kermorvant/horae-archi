    "scene_interpretation": "The figure of God the Father, seated on a rainbow (a symbol of God's covenant with humanity, as seen in the story of Noah), holding a book (representing divine law or scripture) and a sword (symbolizing divine judgment or power), and gesturing towards stars (representing creation or divine order), strongly suggests a depiction of God as Creator and Judge.",
