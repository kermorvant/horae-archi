    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a fragment of a manuscript illumination, characterized by a textured background of pale yellow and grey, suggestive of parchment. A vertical band of vibrant red pigment runs through the center, with some lighter red or pinkish hues bleeding into the surrounding area. The texture and color suggest a decorative element or possibly a stylized representation of blood or drapery, but no figures or architectural elements are clearly discernible.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Due to the lack of identifiable figures or specific iconography, a precise religious or biblical interpretation is not possible. The red pigment could potentially symbolize martyrdom, passion, or a liturgical element, but this is speculative without further context.",
