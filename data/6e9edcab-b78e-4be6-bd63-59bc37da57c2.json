    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo, is depicted in a three-quarter profile, looking to the right. She has long, light brown hair and wears a patterned tunic of gold with red circular motifs, over which is draped a blue mantle. In her left hand, she holds a green palm frond, a symbol of martyrdom. Her right hand holds open a small book, with visible lines of text. Behind her, to the right, stands a tall, grey stone tower with small, rectangular openings and crenellations at the top. In the background, to the left, a distant blue landscape with buildings is visible. The scene is likely a representation of a saint, possibly Saint Barbara, given the tower, or another martyr saint.",
