    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded male figures, each with a halo, stand side-by-side. The figure on the left wears a brown hooded robe with gold trim and a blue garment underneath. The figure on the right wears a red cloak over a green robe, also with gold trim. Both figures have their hands extended, palms open, in a gesture of offering or blessing. The background is a simple blue sky with hints of green landscape below, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figures' solemn expressions and halos indicate they are saints or important religious figures.",
