    "scene_description_enriched": "A lone figure, likely a pilgrim or saint, stands in profile, facing left. He is depicted with a long white beard and a halo, wearing a wide-brimmed hat adorned with a cross. His attire consists of a flowing blue robe and bare feet. He carries a long staff in his right hand, topped with a small cross or finial, and a satchel hangs from his shoulder. In his left hand, he holds a closed book. The background is a decorative pattern of red and gold squares, suggesting a stylized or symbolic setting rather than a realistic one. The ground beneath his feet is a simple green expanse.",
