    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, cradles the body of Christ, who is shown with wounds from the crucifixion. To her left, another figure, likely Mary Magdalene, supports Christ's head. To the right, a man in a blue robe and a distinctive hat holds a vessel, possibly for anointing or collecting blood. In the background, a stylized city with towers and spires is visible, set against a green, hilly landscape. A large wooden cross dominates the upper portion of the scene, framing the figures.",
