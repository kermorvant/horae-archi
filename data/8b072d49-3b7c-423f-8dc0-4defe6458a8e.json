    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men engaged in a craft, likely metalworking or stonemasonry. One man, with a beard and wearing a cap, is actively working on a piece of material placed on an anvil-like block, using a hammer and chisel. Two other men are observing and assisting, also holding tools. The background suggests an architectural setting with decorative elements resembling arches and windows, possibly indicating a workshop or a guild hall. The overall impression is one of skilled labor and communal work.",
