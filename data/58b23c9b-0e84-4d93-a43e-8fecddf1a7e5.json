    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely a saint, stands in a verdant landscape. He wears a red cloak lined with gold over a blue tunic. In his right hand, he holds a golden chalice containing a coiled serpent, a common attribute of Saint John the Evangelist, symbolizing his victory over poison. The background features rolling green hills dotted with trees, and in the distance, a city with prominent towers and spires. The sky is a bright blue with wispy white clouds. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
