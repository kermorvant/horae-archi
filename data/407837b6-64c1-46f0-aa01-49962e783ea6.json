    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, kneels in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies swaddled in a wooden manger, also with a halo. Saint Joseph, also haloed, stands to the left, holding a candle and a flask, his hand raised in a gesture of reverence. A cow and a donkey are present, their heads peering over the manger. Above the stable, through openings, a starry night sky is visible, with distant castles and figures looking on. The architecture is simple, suggesting a stable or a rudimentary shelter, with wooden beams and a thatched roof visible.",
