    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a figure in a pink robe with gold trim kneels, hands clasped in prayer. Facing them on the right is a figure in a vibrant blue robe, also haloed, holding an open red book and gesturing with clasped hands. Behind them, a red, star-studded vaulted ceiling is visible, supported by columns. The background features arched windows with tracery. The overall impression is one of devotion and religious contemplation, likely depicting a scene from the life of a saint or a biblical narrative.",
