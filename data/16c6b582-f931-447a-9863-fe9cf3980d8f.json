The knight wields a sword raised above his head, poised to strike the beast, which has a stick in its mouth. In the background, to the left, a figure in a pink robe, possibly a saint, stands with a lamb. To the right, a castle with towers and crenellations is visible across a body of water, suggesting a distant setting. The overall scene is set in a pastoral landscape under a pale blue sky.",
