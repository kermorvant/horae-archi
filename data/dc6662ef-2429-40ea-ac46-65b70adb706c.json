    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and bleeding from his wounds, standing in dark blue water. Two angels attend him: one on the left, with green wings and a red and yellow garment, places a hand on Christ's shoulder and holds a lily; the other on the right, with green wings and a pink and yellow garment, holds a sword above Christ's head. Above Christ, rays of light emanate from a golden halo, and stylized stars and a lily plant are visible against a blue sky. Below the water, a golden orb rests on a green landscape where several severed heads emerge from the ground, their faces showing expressions of suffering. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, gilded border with blue and red decorative elements.",
