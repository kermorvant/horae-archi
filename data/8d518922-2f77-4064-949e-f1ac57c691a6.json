    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded male figures, both with halos, stand facing forward. The figure on the left holds an open book, its pages filled with text. The figure on the right holds a scroll or staff. Both figures are dressed in robes. The background is dark and appears to be a void, suggesting a non-physical setting. The presence of halos and the depiction of figures holding religious texts or symbols indicate a religious context, likely representing saints or apostles.",
