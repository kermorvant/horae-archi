    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a domestic interior framed by a Gothic arch, where several figures are gathered around a bed. On the bed, a woman in white is holding a baby. To her right, another woman wears a green veil and red dress, and a third woman in a blue garment looks on. In the foreground, a woman in a blue dress is tending to a baby in a wicker basket filled with water. Behind the interior scene, a cityscape is visible with towers and spires, suggesting an urban setting. The overall scene likely represents the Nativity or a related event, possibly the Presentation of Christ in the Temple or the Circumcision, given the presence of the infant and attendants.",
