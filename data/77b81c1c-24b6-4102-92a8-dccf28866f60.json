    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, an angel, identified by wings and a golden robe, kneels and points towards the Virgin Mary. The angel's gesture suggests a message being delivered. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is seated and appears to be reading from an open book placed on a draped lectern. She is dressed in a blue robe and has her hands clasped in prayer or contemplation. Above the figures, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends. The background features architectural elements including a window with tracery and a bed canopy, suggesting a domestic setting. The overall composition conveys the divine announcement of Christ's conception.",
