    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Archangel Michael, adorned in a blue cuirass, golden armor, and a red cape, standing triumphantly over a defeated demon. Michael holds a spear in his right hand, poised to strike, and his left foot rests on the demon's head. The demon, depicted with horns, bat-like wings, and sharp claws, writhes in agony amidst flames. The background is a plain, golden-ochre color, suggesting a divine or otherworldly setting. The vibrant colors and dynamic poses emphasize the struggle between good and evil.",
