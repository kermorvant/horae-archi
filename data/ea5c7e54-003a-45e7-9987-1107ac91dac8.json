    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act within an interior space. A bearded man, adorned with a crown and a blue robe patterned with gold fleur-de-lis, sits on a bench, holding a sword. Before him, a woman in an orange dress kneels, cradling a baby. Two armored soldiers are present. One soldier, wearing a helmet and patterned armor, appears to be restraining another figure, possibly a woman, who is reaching out. A second armored soldier stands over the kneeling woman and child, holding a sword. The background features a shelf with pottery and a wall hanging. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern. This scene is likely an illustration of the Massacre of the Innocents, a biblical event where King Herod ordered the killing of all male infants in Bethlehem.",
