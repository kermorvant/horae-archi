    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely Saint Margaret of Antioch, stands in a landscape, holding a long staff with a red finial. She is dressed in a pink robe and a purple undergarment. To her left, a winged demon with claws and a tail lunges forward, holding a round object with holes. To her right, an angel with orange wings descends, reaching towards the staff. The background is a blue sky dotted with gold stars, and the ground is green with scattered rocks and trees. The scene depicts the temptation and torment of a saint, with the demon representing worldly temptations and the angel offering divine aid.",
