    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed women in a verdant, grassy landscape dotted with small flowers. The woman on the left, dressed in a purple robe and a white head covering, places her hand on the abdomen of the woman on the right. The woman on the right wears a vibrant blue gown and also has her hand resting on her belly, which is visibly distended, indicating pregnancy. Behind them, stylized rocky formations rise, and above, a blue arch frames a golden sunburst emanating divine light. The background features a rich, red tapestry-like pattern with gold scrolling foliage. This imagery represents the Visitation, a biblical event where Mary, pregnant with Christ, visits her cousin Elizabeth, who is also pregnant.",
