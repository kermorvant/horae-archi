    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a martyrdom, likely Saint Stephen, kneeling and looking upwards. He is dressed in a red and gold chasuble, with a wound on his head from which blood is flowing. Two figures are shown assaulting him: one on the left, wearing a red cap and blue tunic, raises his fist as if to strike; the other on the right, wearing a green cap and purple tunic, holds a stone or club above his head, ready to strike. In the background, a city with spires and towers is visible under a blue sky. Rays of golden light descend from the upper part of the image, where a representation of God or Christ is faintly depicted, suggesting divine intervention or witness.",
