    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael, identifiable by his wings and halo, clad in a red robe. He is shown in the act of vanquishing a black dragon, which lies prostrate beneath him. Saint Michael holds a spear, poised to strike, and in his other hand, he raises a cross. The background is divided into two sections: the lower part features a green checkered pattern, representing the earth, while the upper part is adorned with a golden and blue tessellated pattern, suggesting a divine or celestial realm. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative blue foliage.",
