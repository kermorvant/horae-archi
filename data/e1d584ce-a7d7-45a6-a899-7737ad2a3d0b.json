    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ, with a halo, is being lowered from the cross by two figures. One figure, likely Joseph of Arimathea, supports Christ's body from below, embracing him. Another figure, standing on a ladder, is actively involved in the process of removing Christ from the cross, possibly untying his hands. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a grassy ground and a simple cross. The background is filled with text, suggesting this is an illustration within a manuscript.",
