    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, adorned in a white tunic and green mantle, holding a golden staff and gesturing towards the Virgin Mary. His wings are visible on the left. Above them, a white dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a radiant golden light. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is dressed in a blue mantle and has her hands crossed over her chest, her head bowed in a gesture of acceptance and humility. She is seated beside a red table with a book open on it. The background suggests an interior space with architectural elements, including a column and a wall, rendered in muted tones.",
