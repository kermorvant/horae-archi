    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a simple wooden stable. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle, is seated on a red cushion, reading from an open book placed on a wooden stool. The Christ Child, with a golden halo, lies in a manger, reaching out towards the viewer. Behind the manger, a donkey and an ox are visible. To the right, Saint Joseph, wearing a red hat and green cloak over a pink tunic, holds a lantern and a bag, looking towards the Virgin and Child. The background is a starry blue sky, with a prominent star above the stable, from which rays of light emanate. The architecture is rudimentary, suggesting a humble dwelling.",
