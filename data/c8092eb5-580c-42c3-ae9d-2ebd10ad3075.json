    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a burial in progress, set against a backdrop of medieval buildings. Two figures, one in blue and the other in pink, are lowering a body wrapped in white cloth into an open grave. Several monks in dark robes stand to the left, observing the burial, with one holding a small object, possibly a prayer book or rosary. To the right, more monks in black habits are gathered, some with heads bowed in prayer or contemplation. A tall, ornate cross stands prominently in the center, surrounded by smaller wooden crosses. The architectural setting includes buildings with red-tiled roofs and arched windows, suggesting a town or monastic complex. The overall atmosphere is somber and devotional, likely representing a funeral rite.",
