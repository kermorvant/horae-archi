    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a beard and a brown, tasseled hat is depicted in profile, looking downwards. He wears a vibrant blue tunic with gold trim and orange trousers. His hands are engaged in an action involving a dark object and a red substance, possibly blood, on a brown surface. Behind him, a wooden structure with gold detailing is visible, along with a light blue sky and green foliage with gold accents. The scene is framed by a gold arch.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a martyrdom or a violent act, possibly related to a saint or biblical figure. The red substance strongly suggests blood, and the man's focused, somber expression could indicate suffering or the act of inflicting harm. Without further context, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it aligns with themes of sacrifice or persecution common in medieval devotional art.",
