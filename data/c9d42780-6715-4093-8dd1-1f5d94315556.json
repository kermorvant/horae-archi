    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered together, with a central female figure in a blue mantle and a younger figure in a red, patterned garment gesturing. Several bearded men, some with halos, are seated or standing around them. The background is a golden, radiating pattern, suggesting a divine or spiritual setting. The figures are arranged within an oval frame, indicative of a manuscript illumination. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern. The overall impression is one of a significant religious gathering or event.",
