    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an interior space with a patterned wall and a checkered floor. On the left, a woman in a blue robe and white headdress holds a nude infant. To her right, a knight in green armor and a helmet stands, holding a sword raised as if to strike. Facing the knight and slightly to the right is an older man with a long white beard, wearing a red and gold robe and a tall, ornate red hat, holding a staff. Above the figures, architectural elements resembling quatrefoil windows are visible against a blue background. The checkered floor suggests an indoor setting, possibly a hall or a room within a building.",
