    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and white veil, cradles the Christ Child. Three Magi, one kneeling and offering a gift, approach them. The kneeling Magus is dressed in red, while the standing Magi are in green and orange robes, one of whom is Black. Behind them, a partially ruined brick structure with a thatched roof forms the backdrop, suggesting a humble dwelling. A horse's head is visible to the right. The overall setting is outdoors, with a hint of a landscape in the distance.",
