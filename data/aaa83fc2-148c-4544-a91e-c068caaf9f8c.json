    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, draped in a white veil and robe, sits on a donkey, cradling the swaddled Christ Child. To their left, Saint Joseph, an elderly man with a beard, walks alongside, leaning on a staff. The background is a decorative pattern of gold floral motifs on a white ground, suggesting a stylized, perhaps divine, setting rather than a specific earthly location. The figures are rendered with delicate brushstrokes, emphasizing their serene expressions and the tenderness of the moment.",
