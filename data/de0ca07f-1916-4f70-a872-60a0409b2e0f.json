The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, holds the Christ Child, who is also haloed and reaches for a golden chalice. Three Magi, distinguished by their crowns, are present. One kneels, offering a golden chalice, while another stands, holding a golden box. The third, also standing, holds a golden chalice. A radiant star with golden rays shines in the blue, star-filled sky above. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with rich colors and gold leaf accents.",
