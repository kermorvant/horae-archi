    "scene_description_enriched": "In a nocturnal landscape under a starry blue sky, Christ, depicted with a golden halo, kneels on a rocky outcrop, his hands clasped in prayer before a chalice containing a host. Below him, three disciples sleep: one in a red tunic rests his head on a book, another in a blue robe slumps forward, and a third in a pink robe sits with hands folded. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
