    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures are depicted in a devotional scene. The central figure, dressed in a vibrant blue mantle, clasps her hands in prayer, her head bowed in sorrow. To her left, another figure in green also appears to be in prayer or contemplation, with her hands held close to her chest. To the right, a third figure, clad in a reddish-purple robe, looks down with a somber expression. The background is a rich red tapestry adorned with scrolling gold foliage. The figures stand on a green ground, suggesting an outdoor setting, though no specific architectural elements are visible.",
