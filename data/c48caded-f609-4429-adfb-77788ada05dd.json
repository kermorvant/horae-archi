    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely a beggar or a penitent, kneeling on the ground, his hands clasped in prayer. He is partially unclothed, with a white cloth draped around his waist. Behind him, a simple wooden structure with a triangular gable and what appears to be a door or opening is visible. To the right, three figures stand, two of whom are prominent. One figure, dressed in a vibrant blue robe and a straw hat, gestures with an open hand. Beside them, another figure in a rich red robe, trimmed with ermine and also wearing a straw hat, holds a scroll or document. The background shows a hint of architecture and foliage. This scene is interpreted as the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, where Lazarus, a poor beggar, is shown in his suffering, while the rich man and others observe or perhaps ignore him.",
