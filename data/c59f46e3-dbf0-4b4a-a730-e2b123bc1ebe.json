    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a table. In the foreground, a man with grey hair and a beard, wearing a red cloak over a blue robe, kneels and reaches towards a white object on the table, possibly a lamb. To his left, a woman in a blue veil and robe looks on. Behind the kneeling man, another figure in a yellow tunic stands, and to the right, two men in blue and red attire observe the scene. Above them, a green canopy with gold trim is visible, supported by architectural elements that suggest an interior setting. The overall impression is one of a religious or ceremonial gathering.",
