This central motif is encircled by a wreath of stylized green leaves, further adorned with golden elements at the top and bottom, resembling ornate clasps or finials. The background is a soft gradient of pink and purple, suggesting a devotional or symbolic context rather than a literal setting. The overall composition is framed by a dark border.",
