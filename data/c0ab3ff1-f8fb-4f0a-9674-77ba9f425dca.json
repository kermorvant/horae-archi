    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a seated figure, likely the Virgin Mary, holding a cross with a figure of Christ. The Virgin Mary wears a blue mantle over a lighter garment and has a golden halo. She is seated on a throne-like structure, suggested by the white form behind her. The cross is rendered in a pale, textured color, and the figure of Christ is only partially visible. The background is a textured red, with areas of lighter parchment showing through, suggesting wear and tear on the manuscript. The overall impression is one of solemnity and religious devotion.",
