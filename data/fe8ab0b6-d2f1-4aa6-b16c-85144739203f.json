    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, framed by an arched architectural element adorned with floral motifs. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, holds the Christ Child, who reaches towards a white cloth draped over a pedestal. To Mary's left stands a woman holding a staff. To the right, a bearded man, possibly Joseph, kneels, and behind him, a tonsured monk reads from an open book. In the background, through an arched opening, a cityscape with towers is visible under a sky with rays of light. The interior space is suggested by the presence of windows with diamond-shaped panes and a decorative canopy overhead.",
