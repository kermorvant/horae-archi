    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely God the Father, adorned in royal regalia including a crown and rich robes, holding a globe in his left hand and extending his right hand towards a kneeling figure, the Virgin Mary. God the Father is positioned on a throne with an elaborate, Gothic-style architectural backdrop featuring pointed arches and tracery. To the left of the Virgin Mary, a winged angelic figure, possibly the Angel Gabriel, is also present, holding a crown. The figures are set against a radiant blue background with golden rays emanating from behind them, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The Virgin Mary is dressed in a blue robe and her hands are clasped in prayer. The overall composition evokes a sense of divine judgment or pronouncement.",
