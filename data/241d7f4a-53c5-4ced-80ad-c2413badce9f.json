    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in a mitre and ornate cope, stands holding a crozier. He is performing a ritualistic gesture, placing his hand on the head of a kneeling man who wears a cap and a red garment. The scene is set indoors, with architectural elements suggesting a church interior, including a window with tracery in the background. The bishop's gesture likely represents a sacrament or blessing, possibly ordination or confirmation, given the context of a Book of Hours.",
