    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and central placement, interacting with a crowd. To the left, a figure, likely Lazarus, emerges from a tomb, kneeling with hands clasped in prayer and wrapped in a white shroud. Christ, dressed in a blue robe, gestures towards Lazarus, while a man in a green robe stands beside him, seemingly in conversation. A group of onlookers, dressed in various colored garments and hats, observe the event. Behind them, a large, ornate building with Gothic architectural elements, possibly a church, is visible, with other buildings in the background. The scene is set outdoors on a grassy area.",
