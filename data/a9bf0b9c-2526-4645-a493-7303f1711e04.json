    "scene_description_enriched": "In an outdoor setting, a man is shown bound to a wooden structure, likely a rack, with ropes. Another figure, dressed in blue and red, stands over him, holding a long pole or spear that is piercing the bound man's side. The background depicts a green landscape with trees and a distant building with a tower. The scene is a depiction of martyrdom, specifically the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, who was often depicted tied to a post and shot with arrows, or in this case, pierced by a spear.",
