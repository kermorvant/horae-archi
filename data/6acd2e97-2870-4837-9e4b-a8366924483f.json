    "scene_description_enriched": "A young figure, identified as Christ by his halo, is seated on a raised wooden platform, holding an open book and pointing to it. He is dressed in a blue robe. Three older men, presumably scholars or religious figures, are seated around him, listening attentively. The figure on the left wears a red hat and a blue mantle over a light-colored robe. The figure on the right wears a black cap and a red garment beneath a blue collar. The third figure, in the foreground, wears a light blue-green robe. The background features a brick wall and a patterned tapestry. The scene depicts Christ teaching, likely in a setting that evokes a learned or religious environment.",
