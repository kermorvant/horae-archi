    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral procession taking place outdoors, with a prominent Gothic church in the background. Several figures are engaged in the burial. Two men in blue and red tunics are lowering a body, wrapped in a patterned cloth, into an open grave. A deceased individual lies on a white shroud in the grave, with a skull visible at the bottom. A cleric, dressed in a blue and red chasuble and holding a book, stands with a group of white-robed figures, one of whom carries a processional cross and a basket. Behind them, a crowd of figures in black habits, likely monks or mourners, are gathered. The church features pointed arches, a blue tiled roof, and decorative tracery windows. To the left, a building with a dark, steeply pitched roof and windows filled with skulls suggests a charnel house or ossuary.",
