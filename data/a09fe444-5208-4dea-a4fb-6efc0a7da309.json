    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a nude female figure seated on a woven basket or stool. She has long hair and is shown from the chest up, with her arms resting on the sides of the basket. The background is filled with a dense pattern of dots, suggesting foliage or a textured surface. To the left and right, stylized plant forms with leaves and clusters of berries are visible. The overall impression is of a natural setting, possibly a garden or vineyard, with the figure integrated into the environment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is likely an allegorical representation, possibly of a Virtue or a figure associated with nature or abundance, such as Flora or a Bacchante. Without further context or accompanying text, a definitive religious or biblical interpretation is not possible. However, the depiction of abundance through the berries and foliage could allude to themes of fertility or the bounty of nature.",
