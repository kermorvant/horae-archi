    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Christ Child lies in a wooden manger, swaddled and with a halo. To the left, a cow and a donkey are visible, with the donkey's head raised as if braying. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and with a halo, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before an open book placed on a wooden stool. To her right, Saint Joseph, also with a halo, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer, wearing a pink cloak over an orange tunic. The figures are set against a green grassy ground and a blue sky, within a simple wooden stable structure.",
