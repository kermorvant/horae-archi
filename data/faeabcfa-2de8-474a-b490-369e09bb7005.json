    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a formal ceremony, likely a wedding, taking place within an architectural setting. Five figures are present. On the left, a bearded man in a blue robe and pink cloak extends his hands to clasp the hands of a crowned woman in a red, gold-patterned gown and a gold cape. Behind the crowned woman, a figure in a green and gold robe stands, possibly officiating. To the right of the crowned woman, two other figures are visible: one in a red cap and another in a blue robe and white wimple. The background features a large, grey, columnar structure with an arched opening, suggesting a building entrance or interior. The figures are framed by an ornate border of gold and blue foliage.",
