    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth, blood dripping from his wounds. Below the cross, to the left, stands the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue and beige, with her hands clasped in prayer. To the right stands a male figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also with hands clasped in prayer, wearing a red cloak over a dark garment. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling green hills, a body of water in the background, and a cluster of red buildings with spires in the distance. A rocky outcrop is visible on the left. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
