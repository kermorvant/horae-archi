An older man with a long beard, wearing a turban, holds the child and appears to be presenting it. To the left, another man with a beard and a cap stands observing. To the right, a woman with clasped hands, likely the Virgin Mary, looks towards the child. Behind the figures, architectural elements suggest an interior space with arches and columns.",
