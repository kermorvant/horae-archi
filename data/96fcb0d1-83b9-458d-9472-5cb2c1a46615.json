    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Roch, identifiable by his pilgrim's attire, staff, and the plague sore on his leg, being attended by an angel. He wears a hooded cloak over a tunic and hose, with a satchel slung across his chest. A dog, often associated with Saint Roch, is shown near his left leg. Behind the figures is a brick wall, suggesting an enclosed or perhaps a humble dwelling. The angel, with visible wings, is shown tending to Saint Roch's leg, a gesture of divine comfort and healing.",
