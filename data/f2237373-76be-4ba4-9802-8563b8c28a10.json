    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle and yellow tunic, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a blue manger adorned with golden rays. Behind them, an ox and a donkey are visible. To the left, a woman in a black habit and wimple, likely a nun, looks on with devotion, accompanied by three young boys in blue and red robes, also in prayer. The figures are positioned within a stable-like structure, suggested by the rough stone wall and wooden beams in the background. A decorative golden column frames the right side of the scene, and a scroll with Latin text is unfurled above the figures. The overall atmosphere is one of reverence and quiet contemplation.",
