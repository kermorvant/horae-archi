    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a simple stable structure, indicated by wooden beams and a thatched roof. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies in a manger filled with straw, radiating a golden halo. To the left, Saint Joseph, depicted with a white beard and halo, kneels, holding a lit candle. To the right, the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a donkey and an ox are present. The background reveals a pastoral landscape with rolling hills and distant castles, suggesting a setting outside of a major urban center. Golden rays descend from the heavens above the manger, symbolizing divine light.",
