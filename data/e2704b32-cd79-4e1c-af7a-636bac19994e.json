    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child, also with a halo, points towards a chest filled with gold offered by one of the three Magi who kneels before them. The other two Magi stand behind, one bearded and wearing a crown and blue robe, the other younger, also crowned, and dressed in green. A horse is visible in the background within the structure. The setting is an outdoor landscape with hills and distant buildings, under a blue sky with a star. The architectural elements are minimal, suggesting a humble dwelling.",
