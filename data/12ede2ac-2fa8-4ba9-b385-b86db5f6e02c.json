    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Resurrection of Christ. Christ, with wounds visible on his chest and feet, floats above an open tomb, holding a banner with a cross. He is raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing or victory. Below him, several Roman soldiers lie asleep or stunned, some in armor, near the tomb. In the background, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills, trees, and distant buildings, including a church spire. Two figures in blue robes stand in the middle ground to the left, possibly representing Mary Magdalene and another woman approaching the tomb. A faint, ethereal figure is depicted in the sky above Christ, perhaps an angel.",
