    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a demonic figure, dark and winged, looming over several figures who appear to be sleeping or deceased, lying on the ground. One figure, possibly Christ, with a golden halo, is shown raising a hand, seemingly in an act of protection or intervention. Other figures in blue robes are positioned around the scene, some looking towards the demon and others towards the central figure. The background is a rich red tapestry with a gold geometric pattern. The overall impression is one of spiritual struggle or deliverance from evil.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Harrowing of Hell or a similar theme of Christ's victory over demonic forces and death, possibly related to the resurrection or the salvation of souls. The sleeping figures could symbolize those in spiritual slumber or the souls being rescued.",
