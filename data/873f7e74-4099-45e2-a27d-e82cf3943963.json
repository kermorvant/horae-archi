    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a young man, likely a scholar or saint, seated outdoors on a grassy incline, engaged in writing. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a red cloak, with a halo indicating his sanctity. Before him rests an open book, and he holds a quill in his right hand, poised as if to write. To his left, emerging from a tree stump, is a small, dark, demonic figure, seemingly attempting to distract or tempt him. The background features a body of water with a boat, and in the distance, a city with towers and walls. Above, the sky is a deep blue, dotted with golden stars and a radiant sun-like orb from which rays descend, suggesting divine inspiration. The overall composition is framed by an arched border adorned with floral motifs.",
