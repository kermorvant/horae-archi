    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures, likely bishops or high-ranking clergy, stand facing each other. The figure on the left wears a white mitre adorned with gold dots and a grey chasuble with gold embellishments. He holds a book in his left hand and gestures with his right. The figure on the right wears a dark cap and a red chasuble, also decorated with gold. He holds a staff. They are depicted against a blue sky, with a hint of green ground below. The scene is framed by a golden border, suggesting it is an illumination within a manuscript.",
