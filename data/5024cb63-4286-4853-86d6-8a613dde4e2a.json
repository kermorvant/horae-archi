    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, possibly Saint Margaret of Antioch, is depicted seated, holding a book or cloth in her lap. She is dressed in a long, flowing gown and a head covering. Her gaze is directed downwards. In her lap, a small, horned creature, likely a dragon, is being held. The scene is framed by foliage on the right and a vertical element on the left, suggesting an outdoor setting. The presence of the dragon strongly suggests the iconography of Saint Margaret, who is often depicted overcoming or being swallowed by a dragon.",
