    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in an outdoor setting. On the left, a large, dark, hooded figure stands, possibly a monk or a religious figure, with gold detailing on its robes. In the foreground, a person wearing a blue mantle and a cap is kneeling and tending to something in the ground, perhaps planting or digging. The background shows a green landscape with stylized trees and what appear to be agricultural markers or small structures. The overall impression is one of humble labor or devotion in a rural environment.",
