    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by several figures. Christ, wearing a purple robe and a crown of thorns, struggles under the weight of a large wooden cross. Two figures, one in a red tunic and the other in blue armor, appear to be assisting or forcing him along. Behind Christ, a woman in a red garment holds a white cloth displaying the face of Christ, possibly representing Veronica's Veil. In the background, a fortified structure with a round tower and battlements is visible, suggesting a city or castle setting. The overall scene is set outdoors on a grassy, hilly terrain.",
