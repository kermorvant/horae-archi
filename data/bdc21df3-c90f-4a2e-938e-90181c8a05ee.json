    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an architectural setting. On the left, two figures in clerical attire, one in a red and gold cope and the other in a pink garment, are reading from a book placed on a wooden lectern. In the center, a figure draped in a blue, star-patterned robe stands before an altar, flanked by lit candles. Behind this central figure, a golden canopy is visible. To the right, a group of four figures in black monastic habits, with hoods obscuring their faces, are also engaged in reading from books. The background features a vaulted ceiling with blue and gold decoration, supported by columns, and arched windows. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. The overall scene suggests a liturgical service or a devotional rite.",
