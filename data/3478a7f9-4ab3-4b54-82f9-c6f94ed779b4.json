    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures, identified as angels by their wings, are depicted in a blue, watery setting, possibly representing the heavens or a spiritual realm. They are both wearing white robes and have golden halos. The angel on the left holds a scroll, and both angels are looking down at it, with the angel on the right pointing to the text. The scene is framed by an ornate, dark blue border with gold decorative elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Angels reading a scroll can symbolize divine communication, the reading of scripture, or the unfolding of God's plan. Without further context, a specific biblical event is not identifiable, but it generally relates to heavenly knowledge or divine pronouncements.",
