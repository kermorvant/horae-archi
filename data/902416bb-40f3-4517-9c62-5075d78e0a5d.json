    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures within an architectural setting. A bearded man, seated and wearing a hat and a fur-lined cloak, holds a scepter. He is flanked by two other figures. To his left, a person is partially visible, also seated. To his right, a standing figure, wearing a cap and a tunic, faces the seated man. The background features architectural elements suggesting an interior space, possibly a hall or throne room, with decorative elements above. The overall composition suggests a scene of authority or judgment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is likely a representation of a king or ruler, possibly in a scene of judgment or investiture, given the presence of the scepter and the formal arrangement of figures. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific biblical or devotional interpretation is not possible.",
