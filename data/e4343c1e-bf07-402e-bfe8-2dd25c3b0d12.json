    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in an outdoor setting. On the left, an older woman, cloaked in red and brown, stands with her hands clasped over her chest, her head bowed. To her right, a younger man, wearing an orange tunic and blue leggings, is shown in motion, with his hands raised and palms facing outwards, as if in supplication or surprise. Behind the woman, a blue sign with gold lettering reads 'NON Q VIESCAM'. The ground is depicted as a green field with stylized blades of grass. The overall scene appears to be a narrative illustration, possibly from a literary or historical text, rather than a religious one, given the inscription and the lack of overt religious iconography.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The inscription 'NON Q VIESCAM' is likely a Latin phrase, possibly meaning 'I shall not rest' or 'I will not cease'. Without further context or clearer religious iconography, a definitive religious interpretation is not possible. The scene could represent a moment of pursuit, a plea, or a declaration of intent within a narrative. The figures' gestures and the inscription suggest a dramatic or emotional moment.",
