    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and cope, is seated on a green cushion, writing in a book. He holds a quill in his right hand and rests his left on the open pages. A crozier stands behind him. To the right, a small table holds a cross. In the background, a castle is depicted on a hill under a sky from which divine light emanates. The scene is framed by a richly patterned curtain on the left and architectural elements on the right, suggesting an interior setting with a view to the exterior.",
