    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded male figures, both with golden halos, stand facing each other against a decorative patterned background. The figure on the left, dressed in a blue mantle over an orange tunic, holds a closed book and a staff. A white sash or scroll hangs from the staff. The figure on the right, wearing a pale pink mantle over a yellow tunic, gestures with his right hand and holds a long red staff topped with a spearhead. The ground beneath them is green and grassy. The scene is likely devotional, possibly depicting two saints or prophets in conversation or contemplation.",
