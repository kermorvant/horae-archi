    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated on a raised platform, her hands raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. She wears a blue mantle over a golden garment. Above her, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, with large wings and a red robe, kneels and gestures towards Mary, holding a scroll with Latin text. Behind Gabriel, a divine figure, likely God the Father, is depicted in a radiant circle. The background features a patterned tapestry and a vaulted ceiling with windows. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkerboard pattern. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
