    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, likely a king or a noble, is depicted in profile, facing left. He wears a tall, conical hat with a brim and a long, flowing robe. His left hand is raised, with the index finger extended, in a gesture of speaking or teaching. A circular medallion with a central circle is visible on his chest, possibly an emblem or part of his attire. The figure is framed by decorative borders, suggesting this is an illustration from a manuscript or printed book. The scene is devoid of any architectural elements or a specific setting, focusing solely on the portrait of the individual.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image appears to be a portrait of a king or a significant male figure, possibly from a historical or allegorical context rather than a specific biblical narrative. The gesture of the raised finger could imply authority, wisdom, or a proclamation. Without further context, a precise religious or biblical interpretation is not possible.",
