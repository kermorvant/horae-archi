    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in what appears to be an outdoor setting, suggested by the ground texture and foliage. On the left, a figure in ornate armor and a headdress holds a spear. In the center, another armored figure, also wearing a helmet, stands with a spear. To the right, a hooded figure, representing Death, holds a scythe and is positioned behind the central figure, with a skull visible above its head. The figures are rendered in a woodcut style, with strong lines and hatching. The overall composition suggests a symbolic representation of mortality or the inevitability of death, possibly in the context of worldly power or conflict.",
