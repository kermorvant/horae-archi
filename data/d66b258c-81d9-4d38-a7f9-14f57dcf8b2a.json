    "scene_description_enriched": "A vibrant bouquet of flowers is depicted in a blue, gold-trimmed vase. The arrangement includes tulips, red and white peonies, blue hyacinths, and purple flowers, all rendered with rich colors and detailed brushwork. The vase itself is ornate, with a textured blue body and a gilded base and rim, resting on a patterned surface. The background is a plain, light color, with some text visible at the top, suggesting this is an illustration from a manuscript or book.",
