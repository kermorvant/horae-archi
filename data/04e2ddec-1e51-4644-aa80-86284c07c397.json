    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, framed by an arched architectural element adorned with floral motifs. In the center, a bearded man, likely Simeon, wearing a royal crown and a blue mantle over a red robe, sits on a raised platform covered with a patterned cloth. He is receiving the Christ Child, held by the Virgin Mary, who wears a blue robe and a golden halo. Behind Mary stands a woman, possibly Anna, and behind Simeon, another bearded man in a green hood. Above Simeon, a decorative canopy with red and blue panels hangs, featuring a bell-like object. The background shows arched windows with tracery, suggesting an interior setting. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern of yellow and red.",
