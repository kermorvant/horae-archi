    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, stands within an arched architectural setting. He wears a blue cope adorned with gold trim over a red chasuble and white alb. In his right hand, he holds a white dove, which is pecking at a small blue vial. His left hand grasps a tall, ornate crozier. The background behind him is a richly decorated gold brocade pattern. To his sides are pink walls with arched openings, suggesting a chamber or alcove. The floor is a checkered pattern of green and yellow squares, with red circular motifs. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral and foliate motifs.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a bishop receiving divine inspiration or a spiritual gift, symbolized by the dove, which represents the Holy Spirit. The vial could represent holy oil or another sacramental element. The bishop's attire and regalia clearly identify him as a high-ranking cleric, and the presence of the dove suggests a moment of spiritual significance, possibly related to his consecration or a specific liturgical function.",
