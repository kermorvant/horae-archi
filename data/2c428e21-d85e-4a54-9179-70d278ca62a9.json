The figure wears a blue tunic and holds a small object, perhaps a flower or a piece of fruit, in their right hand. Their left hand is raised, also holding a similar object. The background is an abstract, decorative wall with a repeating geometric pattern. Above the wall is a blue arch, framed by a decorative border with floral motifs. The scene is rendered in a stylized, manuscript illumination style.",
