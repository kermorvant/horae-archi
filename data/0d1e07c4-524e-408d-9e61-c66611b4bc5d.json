    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two registers within large, gilded, illuminated letters. In the upper register, a crowned figure, likely a king, sits and plays a harp. The harp has a decorative dragon's head at its top. In the lower register, a knight in full mail armor stands with a spear and a shield bearing a dragon emblem. To the left of the knight, a smaller figure, possibly a page or squire, throws a stone or a small object. The figures are set against a gold background, suggesting a divine or elevated context. The overall composition is highly stylized and decorative, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
