    "scene_description_enriched": "A person, likely a woman, is depicted seated on a cushioned surface, possibly a bench or throne, within a stylized natural setting. She is wearing a headdress and a draped garment. Her hands are raised to her mouth, as if drinking or eating something from a small vessel. Behind her, a tree with branches and leaves is visible, and the background is filled with stippling, suggesting a starry sky or a dense foliage. The scene is framed by decorative borders. The overall impression is one of a serene, possibly contemplative moment, set against a natural backdrop.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is likely a depiction of a saint or a devotional figure in a moment of quiet contemplation or receiving divine sustenance. Without further iconographic clues, a specific interpretation is difficult, but the imagery evokes themes of nature, nourishment, and spiritual peace.",
