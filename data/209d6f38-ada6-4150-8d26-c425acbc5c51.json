    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered under a decorative arch, with a radiant divine light emanating from above. In the center, a figure wearing a jeweled crown and a bishop's mitre, with hands clasped in prayer, is flanked by other figures in religious attire, some also with halos. To the left, a bearded figure leans on a staff, while to the right, another figure in a bishop's mitre also prays. The figures are seated, suggesting a moment of contemplation or council. The overall composition, with the divine light and the presence of religious figures, strongly suggests a scene of spiritual significance, likely representing a moment of divine inspiration or a council of saints.",
