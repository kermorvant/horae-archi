    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A bearded man, likely a priest, wearing a mitre and ornate robes, holds the Christ Child on a raised platform. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, kneels before the platform, her hands clasped in prayer. Behind her, a woman holds a basket containing two doves, an offering for the purification rite. A crowd of onlookers, some with hoods and beards, observe the event. The architectural setting features columns and arches, suggesting an interior space, possibly a temple or church. Above the scene, figures are depicted in a more decorative, almost allegorical manner, possibly representing biblical narratives or symbolic figures.",
