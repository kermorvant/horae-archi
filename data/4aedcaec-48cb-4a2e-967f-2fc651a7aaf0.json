    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ. Christ is shown on the cross, with a halo and the inscription 'INRI' above his head. Several figures surround the cross. To the right, a man appears to be hammering a nail into Christ's hand. To the left and below, other figures are present, one holding a hammer and another seemingly engaged in some action related to the event. In the background, architectural elements suggestive of a city or buildings are visible, framed by an arched border. The overall impression is a dramatic and somber depiction of Christ's sacrifice.",
