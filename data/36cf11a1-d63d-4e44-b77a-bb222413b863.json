    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted with a halo, wearing a blue garment and a red cloak lined with gold. She cradles a small, white, orb-like object in her arms, possibly representing the Christ Child or a symbol of divine conception. Her head is covered with a white veil, and her expression is one of sorrow or contemplation. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling blue hills and green trees under a bright blue sky.",
