    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child on her lap. Three Magi, identified by their crowns, approach, each bearing a golden vessel. The first Magus, an older man with a long white beard, kneels before them. Behind him, two younger Magi stand, one in a red tunic and the other in a blue robe. The architectural setting is rudimentary, suggesting a humble stable with exposed wooden beams and a thatched roof. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
