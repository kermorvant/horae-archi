    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a burial service taking place within an arched architectural setting that suggests a church interior. Several figures are present: two individuals in pink and red tunics are carefully handling a body wrapped in white cloth, preparing to place it into an open wooden coffin. Behind them, a cleric in blue and gold vestments reads from an open book, possibly a liturgical text, while holding a cross. Other figures, some in white robes and others in black monastic habits, stand by, observing the ceremony. One figure in white holds a bucket and another a staff with a star-like ornament. The background includes architectural elements like columns, arches, and a stone wall, with a glimpse of a blue sky and distant landscape through an opening. The overall scene represents a funeral rite, likely a burial service within a religious context.",
