    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man wearing a crown and a richly decorated robe sits with his hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards towards a window. Beside him stands a young woman in a red dress and a green headdress. The scene takes place indoors, within a room with brick walls and a tiled floor. A stylized sunburst emanates from the window, suggesting divine light or inspiration. The composition evokes a moment of intense prayer or supplication, possibly by a king or royal figure.",
