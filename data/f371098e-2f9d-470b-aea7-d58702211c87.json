    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a bishop or pope, is depicted holding a processional cross in their left hand and a red book in their right arm. The figure wears a richly decorated cope over a green vestment, and a jeweled mitre atop their head, surrounded by a golden halo. The background is a bright blue sky with a few white clouds. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling a Gothic arch with tracery, suggesting an interior view looking outwards or a representation within an architectural context.",
