    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and wounds, standing centrally with his right hand raised in blessing and his left hand holding a staff topped with a cross. He is surrounded by soldiers, two of whom are prominently featured in the foreground, holding spears. Behind Christ, architectural elements suggestive of a city or buildings are visible, including towers and arched structures. The overall impression is one of Christ's triumph or authority amidst his captors or accusers.",
