    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape under a blue sky, framed by an arched border with decorative elements. In the foreground, two figures are present: a younger man kneeling and looking upwards with his hand raised, and an older man standing with a shepherd's crook, also looking upwards. Several sheep are visible behind the kneeling man. In the upper part of the scene, within a celestial mandorla, a divine figure, possibly God the Father or an angel, is depicted with outstretched arms, radiating golden light. In the background, rolling hills are dotted with stylized architectural structures, suggesting a distant settlement or landscape features. The overall scene evokes a moment of divine revelation or communication with the earthly realm.",
