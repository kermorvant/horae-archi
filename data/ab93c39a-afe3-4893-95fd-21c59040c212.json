    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies on the ground. Behind them, a simple wooden structure with exposed beams suggests a stable. To the right, an older man, likely Saint Joseph, leans over a low wall, pointing towards the child. The background opens to a pastoral landscape with rolling hills, trees, and distant buildings under a blue sky illuminated by divine rays emanating from a golden sunburst at the top. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with gold leaf and floral motifs.",
