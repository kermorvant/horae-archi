    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a manger. To the right, Saint Joseph, dressed in purple and red, leans on a staff, while another woman, possibly a midwife, attends to papers in a wooden box. A donkey and an ox are visible in the background, near the manger. Above the stable, a divine light emanates from a bust of God the Father, symbolizing divine intervention. The architectural setting is rudimentary, suggesting the poverty of the Nativity.",
