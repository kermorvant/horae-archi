    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, clad in a golden cloak over a blue robe, kneels and gestures towards the Virgin Mary. He holds a staff topped with a cross. Above him, through an arched opening, a depiction of God the Father crowned and radiating light is visible, with golden rays extending downwards. In the center, a lectern with an open book rests on the floor. To the right, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue gown and a white veil, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Behind her is a large red bed with golden trim. A white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from above. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. A Gothic-style window with tracery is visible on the back wall.",
