    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures seated on a raised platform, against a gold leaf background. On the left, a woman in a blue robe and a crown with a halo is shown with her hands clasped over her chest. On the right, an older man, also crowned and with a halo, is placing a crown on the woman's head. He wears a red tunic and a pink robe, and holds a golden orb in his left hand. The platform is rendered with architectural lines, suggesting a throne or a raised seating area. The overall scene is framed by a decorative border, with a blue and gold outer frame and a red inner frame. The gold leaf background is cracked, a common feature of medieval manuscripts.",
