    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of four figures in an outdoor setting with architectural ruins. In the foreground, a man with white hair and a beard, his body covered in sores, reclines on the ground, draped in a white cloth. He is being approached by three younger figures. Two of them are playing musical instruments: one plays a lute, and another plays a pipe. The third figure stands behind them. In the background, there are ruins of classical architecture, including arches and towers, set against a hilly landscape with trees. The overall impression is one of a pastoral or allegorical scene, possibly representing a biblical narrative or a moral lesson.",
