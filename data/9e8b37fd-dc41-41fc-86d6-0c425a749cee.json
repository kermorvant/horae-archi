    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman in a long, flowing red gown with her hands raised in a gesture of distress or supplication is being attacked by a demonic figure. The demon, depicted as a gaunt, grey creature with sharp teeth and claws, is aiming a spear at the woman's head. A beam of light emanates from the spear's tip, striking the woman's forehead. The scene takes place outdoors, with a green grassy ground, some foliage, and a brick wall in the background. A small, conical object, possibly a lamp or a basket, is visible on the left side of the image. The sky is a vibrant blue.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the temptation or torment of a saint by a demon, a common theme in medieval devotional art. The spear striking the woman's head could symbolize a spiritual attack or a specific trial she is enduring. The presence of the demon and the woman's reaction suggest a struggle against evil or temptation.",
