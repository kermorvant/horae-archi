    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely a saint, seated and partially draped in white cloth, with a halo and a blue crown. He is positioned next to a dark, rough-hewn stone structure, possibly a hermitage or a ruin, with a cross visible on top. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills and distant mountains is depicted. Three figures stand to the right of the seated man: a woman in a golden robe and black garment, a man in a blue robe playing a pipe, and another figure in a red robe and blue head covering. Above them, in the upper part of the image, a divine figure with a red robe and halo is depicted amidst clouds and golden rays, suggesting a heavenly presence. The overall scene appears to be a depiction of a saint's life, possibly involving divine intervention or visitation.",
