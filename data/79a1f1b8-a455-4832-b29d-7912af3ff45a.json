    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in the foreground, gesturing with his right hand. He is dressed in elaborate liturgical vestments, including a blue dalmatic and a red cope adorned with gold embroidery. To his left, three young boys, depicted with pale skin and hands clasped in prayer, are partially submerged in a wooden tub. Behind the boys, a section of a stone wall with a Gothic-style window is visible. The background behind the bishop is a vibrant blue, decorated with scattered gold motifs, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The scene likely depicts a saintly bishop performing a miracle, possibly related to the protection or salvation of children.",
