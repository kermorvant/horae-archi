    "scene_description_enriched": "The upper register depicts a group of men, some wearing crowns, gathered around a central figure who plays a harp. Another figure holds a scroll. The figures are richly robed in blues and reds. The lower register shows a scene with several men, one in a red robe handing a scroll to another man in a blue robe, who is reaching for it. Behind them, other figures observe the exchange. The scene is set against a gold background, suggesting a divine or important context. The figures stand on a ground line that appears to be water or waves.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a biblical event, possibly related to the presentation of scripture or prophecy. The figures with crowns could be kings or prophets, and the scroll represents divine word or law. The upper scene might depict a prophetic vision or the transmission of knowledge, while the lower scene could be a specific moment of revelation or teaching.",
