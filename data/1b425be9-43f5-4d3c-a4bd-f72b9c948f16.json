    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a farmer, is depicted in an outdoor setting, standing in a field. The figure wears an orange tunic and blue hose, and carries a woven basket filled with what appears to be grain or seeds. The figure's left hand is extended, as if scattering seeds, suggesting an act of sowing. The background is a vibrant blue, possibly representing the sky, with scattered white dots that could be stars or a stylized representation of the heavens. The ground is rendered with horizontal lines of brown and yellow, indicating plowed or sown earth.",
