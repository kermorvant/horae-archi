    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and the presence of a book and a pair of pincers, stands centrally. She holds the pincers in her right hand and a book open in her left. Her long hair flows down her shoulders. Behind her, to the right, a stylized architectural structure resembling a church tower with a cross on top is visible, along with other buildings. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a decorative or symbolic space. The overall composition is framed by an arched border. The pincers are a clear attribute of Saint Apollonia, who is often depicted with them, referencing her martyrdom where her teeth were extracted.",
