    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, who reaches for a book held by Saint Anne. Saint Anne, dressed in a red mantle over a blue garment and a white veil, is seated and reading from the book. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, kneels and presents the child. The figures are positioned within a tent-like structure with orange and green drapery. In the background, a building with a tower and timber-framed elements is visible, suggesting a domestic or civic setting. The overall scene is rendered with vibrant colors and gold accents, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
