    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a man with a distinctive horned hat and beard gestures outwards. In the center, a man with a beard, likely representing Christ, is speaking to a woman with long hair who is clasping her hands in prayer. They are surrounded by other men. On the right, a figure in a conical hat and robes, possibly a bishop or religious figure, points. The scene is framed by an arched structure supported by columns, suggesting an interior space, possibly a church or a hall.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts Christ and the Woman of Samaria at the well, a common theme in Christian art. The woman's clasped hands indicate prayer or supplication, and Christ's gesture suggests teaching or discourse. The presence of other figures, including a man in a bishop's attire, could represent disciples or witnesses to the event.",
