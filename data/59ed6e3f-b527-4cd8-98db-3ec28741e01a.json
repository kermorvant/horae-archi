    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a female saint, stands with a golden chalice in her hands. She wears a blue-grey tunic adorned with gold patterns and a deep red mantle draped over her shoulders. The background is divided into horizontal bands of dark green and gold, with a decorative frieze of interlocking circles and lines. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern of blue, green, and pinkish-orange. The figure's gaze is downcast, and her posture suggests contemplation or prayer. The presence of the chalice, especially if it contains a serpent, is a common attribute of Saint Margaret of Antioch, who is often depicted with this symbol of her victory over the devil in the form of a dragon.",
