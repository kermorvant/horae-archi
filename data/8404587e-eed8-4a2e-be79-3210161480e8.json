    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a banquet or feast, likely a significant religious event, with several figures gathered around a table laden with food and drink. At the center, a figure identified as Christ, with a halo, gestures with his right hand while speaking. To his right sits the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, dressed in blue. Other figures, including men and women, are present at the table. A servant in the foreground, wearing bright orange boots, carries a jug and a goblet, suggesting he is serving the guests. The setting appears to be an interior space, possibly a hall, with a rich red drapery forming a backdrop and a patterned floor. The presence of Christ, Mary, and the context of a meal strongly suggests the Wedding at Cana.",
