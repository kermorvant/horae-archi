To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue robe and white veil, looks down with sorrow. To the right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, gazes upwards towards Christ, clad in a blue tunic and a red cloak. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, sparse vegetation, and a blue sky. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
