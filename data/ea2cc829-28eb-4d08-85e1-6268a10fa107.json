    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men gathered around a tomb or altar, where a robed figure, likely a bishop or high-ranking cleric, is gesturing towards a scroll. The architectural setting is elaborate, featuring a green, multi-tiered structure with arches, columns, and decorative elements, suggesting a sacred or important building. Behind this structure, a cityscape with towers and spires is visible under a blue sky. The figures are dressed in medieval attire, with some wearing distinctive hats. The overall impression is one of a solemn occasion, possibly a religious ceremony or a significant discussion related to a sacred text or relic.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a religious or historical event, possibly related to the veneration of a saint, the reading of a sacred text, or a council. The presence of a bishop-like figure and the tomb-like structure suggest a context of religious authority and ritual. Without specific iconographic clues, a precise interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of religious teaching, commemoration, or decision-making within a sacred space.",
