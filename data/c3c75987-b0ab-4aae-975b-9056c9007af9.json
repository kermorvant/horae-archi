    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identifiable by his halo and his traditional attribute, the eagle, which stands to his left holding a scroll in its beak. John is shown seated on a rocky, grassy outcrop overlooking a body of water. He is dressed in a white tunic and a red mantle, and he holds a quill in his right hand, poised as if to write on a scroll unfurled on his lap. The background features a body of water with a ship, and beyond that, a hilly landscape with a fortified city and a distant castle. The overall setting suggests a contemplative or inspired moment for the Evangelist.",
