Its right hand is raised, with two fingers extended in a gesture of blessing or teaching, while its left hand holds a golden orb. The background depicts a rolling green landscape dotted with bushes and trees, under a blue sky with scattered clouds. In the distance, on rolling hills, are stylized representations of castles or fortified buildings. The scene is framed by decorative gold borders.",
