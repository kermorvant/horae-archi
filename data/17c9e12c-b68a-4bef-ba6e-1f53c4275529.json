    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, with a golden halo and wounds from scourging, stands in the center. To his left, a man in a blue robe and red hat holds Christ's arm and appears to be striking him with a rod. Another figure, possibly a youth, is held by the man in blue. To Christ's right, a figure in a blue tunic and yellow hat strikes Christ with a whip. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that suggests an interior space with arched windows and a vaulted ceiling. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
