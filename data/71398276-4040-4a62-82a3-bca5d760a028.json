    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowded gathering of figures, some with wings, suggesting they are angels, amidst a complex architectural setting. Several small, stylized buildings with spires and arched doorways are visible. The overall impression is one of a celestial or heavenly realm, possibly a depiction of the Last Judgment or a heavenly host. In the foreground, a seated figure, possibly a prophet or a soul, looks upwards with a pensive expression. The background is filled with a starry sky, reinforcing the otherworldly nature of the scene.",
