    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious gathering within an architectural setting that resembles a church interior. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary, holding the Christ Child, is presented. To her left stands a woman in a wimple, carrying a basket, possibly representing a saint or a follower. To the right, an older man with a beard, likely Saint Joseph, looks towards the child. Behind them, an altar is visible with a crucifix and figures, suggesting a sacred space. The background features arched windows with tracery, indicative of Gothic architecture. The overall scene is framed by decorative elements at the top, characteristic of manuscript illumination.",
