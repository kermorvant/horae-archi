    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated on a throne, holding the Christ Child. She wears a crown and a halo, as does the child. Two winged figures, likely angels, flank the throne. The angel on the left plays a harp-like instrument, while the angel on the right plays a viol. The throne is elaborate, with steps leading up to it, and is partially enclosed by a canopy. The background is dark, with decorative elements of foliage and stars visible in the upper corners. The overall setting suggests a divine or regal context for the Madonna and Child.",
