    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel in combat with a dragon. He is shown with large, golden wings, wearing a purple tunic adorned with gold patterns and dark leggings. In his right hand, he wields a sword raised to strike, while his left hand holds a shield bearing a red cross within a circle. The dragon, depicted in shades of brown and grey, has its mouth open, with a red tongue visible, and appears to be recoiling from the attack. The background is a landscape with rolling green hills and scattered trees, under a blue sky dotted with gold stars. The overall composition suggests a divine battle against evil.",
