    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands on the left, clad in a blue cope over an orange tunic and white alb. He holds a medallion in his left hand. To the right, three young boys, unclothed, are depicted within a golden boat-like structure. The background is a simple grey wash, suggesting an outdoor or undefined setting. The scene likely depicts a saintly bishop performing a miracle, possibly saving children or intervening in their behalf, a common theme in hagiography.",
