    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered together, illuminated by golden halos, suggesting they are saints or apostles. At the center, a woman in a blue mantle, likely the Virgin Mary, is seated with her hands clasped in prayer or contemplation. Beside her, another figure, possibly an apostle, looks towards her. Above them, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from a radiant blue sky, with golden rays emanating downwards. The figures are seated on what appear to be stone benches, and the ground is covered with a patterned textile. The overall composition is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
