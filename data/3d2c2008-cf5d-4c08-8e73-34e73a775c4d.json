In the foreground, a robed figure stands with hands clasped in prayer before a tomb or altar, which is adorned with fleur-de-lis motifs. Behind this figure, a group of three individuals are gathered around a lectern, engaged in reading or singing from a large open book. The architecture features ribbed vaults, arched windows with tracery, and decorative tiling on the floor. The overall impression is one of solemn devotion and liturgical practice.",
