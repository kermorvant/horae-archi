    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body showing wounds. To his left stand the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, and another woman in red, both with hands clasped in prayer. A woman in a patterned dress kneels at the foot of the cross, reaching towards it. To Christ's right, two figures are also crucified, one with a beard and the other with a halo. Below them, a man on a white horse, wearing armor and a helmet, holds a spear. Behind the figures, a city with towers and walls is visible, set against a blue, star-filled sky.",
