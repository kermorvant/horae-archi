    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures are depicted in a field of tall, golden wheat. The figure on the left, wearing a straw hat, is actively harvesting the wheat with a sickle, holding a bundle of stalks. The figure on the right is also engaged in harvesting, bending down to gather the wheat. The scene is framed by a decorative border with floral motifs and gold leaf, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript, likely a Book of Hours, illustrating the agricultural cycle or a specific month.",
