    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a table covered with a patterned cloth. On the table stands a nude infant, reaching out. To the left of the infant, a woman in a dark dress with her hands clasped is looking towards the viewer. Next to her, another woman in a dark garment is also looking forward. Behind the infant, a bearded man holds a candle. To the right of the infant, a figure wearing a bishop's mitre and robes is seated. The background is dark and decorated with swirling patterns, suggesting foliage or abstract motifs. The floor is a checkered pattern. The overall impression is of a domestic or devotional gathering.",
