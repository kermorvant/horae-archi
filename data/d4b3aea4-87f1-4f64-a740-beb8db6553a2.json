    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child, who also has a halo. Saint Joseph, with a grey beard and wearing a dark hat and orange hood, walks beside the donkey, holding a staff. They are traveling through a landscape with rolling green hills, scattered trees, and a body of water in the background. In the distance, on the left, a town with several spires and buildings is visible. The overall impression is one of a pilgrimage or flight.",
