    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint Luke by the halo and the presence of his evangelist symbol, the ox, is depicted writing on a scroll. He is seated on a throne-like chair draped with a red cloth. He holds a quill in his right hand and is looking upwards, seemingly inspired. The background suggests an interior space with large, grey, segmented columns on the left and a grey, panelled wall behind him. To the right, an ox is visible, resting on a green, textured surface, likely representing the ground or a stylized landscape element. The scene is likely an illustration of Saint Luke writing his Gospel, a common theme in Books of Hours.",
