    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated and holding the Christ Child, both with halos. To the left, a woman in a long brown dress and a tall, conical headdress with a veil kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. In front of her is an open book with text. The figures are set in a green, hilly landscape. In the background, a cluster of buildings with towers and spires is visible on a distant hill. Golden rays of light emanate from the upper left corner, suggesting divine illumination. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
