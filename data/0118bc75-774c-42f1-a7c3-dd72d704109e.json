    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man with long, wavy hair, wearing a cap and a tunic with a pendant, is depicted in profile, looking to the right. His right hand is raised with a finger pointing upwards, while his left hand rests on his lap. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a celestial or divine setting. The figure is framed by architectural elements that appear to be decorative arches or columns, hinting at a sacred or important context. The gesture of pointing upwards is often associated with prophecy, divine instruction, or a sermon.",
