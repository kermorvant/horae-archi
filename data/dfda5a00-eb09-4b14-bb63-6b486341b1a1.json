    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a haloed male figure, likely a saint, standing within an arched frame adorned with foliage. He wears a red outer robe over a white tunic and holds a palm frond in his left hand and a red bag with yellow circular motifs in his right. Two arrows pierce his shoulders, indicating martyrdom. Behind him, a stone wall separates the foreground from a landscape featuring trees and a distant architectural complex with towers and spires. The ground is tiled with a green diamond pattern. The figure's attire and the presence of martyrdom symbols suggest a depiction of a saint, possibly Saint Sebastian, given the arrows.",
