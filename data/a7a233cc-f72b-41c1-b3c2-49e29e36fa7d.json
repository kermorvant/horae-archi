    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman, partially undressed and standing, with a man on her left holding her arm and another man on her right holding a tool. The figures are within an architectural setting that appears to be a room with a vaulted ceiling and a colonnade. In the background, through an archway, other figures are visible in what seems to be an outdoor or different indoor space. The overall scene suggests a moment of coercion or judgment, possibly related to a trial or punishment, given the presence of the tool and the woman's vulnerable state. The inscription above the architectural element reads 'ASSIS'.",
