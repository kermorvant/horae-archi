    "scene_description_enriched": "A young woman with a halo stands in a dark, stylized landscape. She wears a long dress and cloak, and her hands are held in a gesture of contemplation or prayer. To her left, a small, square tower with battlements is depicted. To her right, a stylized tree or plant is visible. The background is dark and textured, with faint decorative elements. The scene is framed by a decorative border at the top and bottom, featuring floral motifs. This scene likely depicts a female saint, possibly Saint Barbara, given the presence of the tower, a common attribute associated with her martyrdom.",
