    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable structure, suggested by the presence of a manger and straw. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies on a blue cloth on the ground. To the right, an elderly man, likely Saint Joseph, kneels with his hands raised in prayer and awe. Behind them, a donkey and an ox are visible. The architectural setting features classical columns with ornate capitals and arches, suggesting a blend of humble stable and classical ruins. Above, a group of figures, possibly shepherds or angels, are seen in the background, illuminated by divine light descending from above.",
