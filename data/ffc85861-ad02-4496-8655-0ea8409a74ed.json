    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue and holding the Christ Child, riding on a donkey. A man, likely Saint Joseph, walks alongside the donkey, guiding it. The figures are set against a landscape with trees and rolling hills. In the background, a walled city with towers and domes is visible, suggesting a journey towards a settlement. The overall scene evokes the Holy Family's flight into Egypt or a similar pilgrimage.",
