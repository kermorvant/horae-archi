    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching out. One of the Magi, kneeling and bearded, offers a golden vessel. Another Magus, with dark skin and ornate armor, stands behind him, holding a dark object. A third figure, richly dressed in red and gold, stands between them, gesturing with his finger and holding a golden chalice. In the background, architectural elements suggest a palace or grand building, with a distant landscape featuring a castle under a starry sky. The scene is framed by decorative architectural elements, including columns and an arched structure.",
