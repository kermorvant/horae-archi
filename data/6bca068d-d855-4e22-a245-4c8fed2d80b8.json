    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a monstrous, horned figure with fur and clawed feet, holding a staff, standing in a grassy landscape. Above and to the left, a figure with long hair and a beard, possibly representing a divine or spiritual entity, is depicted emerging from a blue, watery expanse, holding a golden orb. Rays of light emanate from this upper figure. The overall impression is one of a confrontation or interaction between a demonic entity and a celestial or divine presence.",

The upper figure could symbolize God or Christ, and the lower figure represents a demon or temptation.",
