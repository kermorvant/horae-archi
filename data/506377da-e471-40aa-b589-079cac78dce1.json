    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an elderly, bearded man, partially unclothed and seated, looking upwards. He is attended by a figure wearing a blue tunic and a white cloth draped over their shoulder. This attendant figure has dark hair and two small horns on their forehead, and is offering a small bowl and a piece of food to the seated man. In the background, a stylized, blue cityscape with towers is visible against a light blue sky. The overall impression is one of a spiritual or devotional encounter, possibly representing a saint being tempted or sustained.",
