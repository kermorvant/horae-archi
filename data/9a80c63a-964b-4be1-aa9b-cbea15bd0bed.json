    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a peasant, is depicted in an outdoor setting, engaged in harvesting. The figure wears a simple orange tunic and blue hose, and holds a scythe, actively cutting down stalks of grain in a green field. Behind the figure is a decorative wall, rendered in red with a gold geometric pattern. The scene is framed by an arched border with floral motifs and gold leaf, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript, possibly depicting agricultural labor or the cycle of the seasons.",
