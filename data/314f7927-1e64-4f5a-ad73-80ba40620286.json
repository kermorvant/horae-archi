    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures, one on the left wearing a yellow and red striped robe and a tall, conical hat, and another on the right with a beard, wearing a blue robe and a red cloak, holding a scroll. Both figures are presented against a dark background adorned with a repeating pattern of gold circles. The figure on the right has a halo, suggesting a divine or saintly status. To the right of the figure with the halo, a bull is depicted, facing left. The figures appear to be engaged in a dialogue or presentation, indicated by the scrolls they hold, which are inscribed with text. The overall presentation is stylized and symbolic, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
