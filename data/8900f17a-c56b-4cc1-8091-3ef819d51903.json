    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a long grey beard and hair, wearing a royal mantle lined with ermine, and a blue robe adorned with gold fleur-de-lis. He is shown in profile, looking upwards with his hands raised in prayer. In the background, a winding path leads towards a fortified castle complex situated on a hill. A group of figures are walking along this path. Above the castle, in the sky, a figure in red robes and a red hat, possibly a divine messenger or a saint, is depicted with outstretched arms, holding a trident-like object. The overall setting is a hilly landscape with trees and a distant body of water.",
