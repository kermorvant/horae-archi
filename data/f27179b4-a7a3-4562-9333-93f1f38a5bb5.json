    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, standing outside a gilded, open-sided structure. He gestures towards a group of figures within. Inside, a woman lies on a bed, attended by two other women. One of the attendants holds a swaddled infant. The interior is richly decorated with patterned textiles and a canopy. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills and distant buildings is visible under a blue sky. This scene is likely the Nativity of Christ, with the bishop representing a significant figure, perhaps a prophet or a saint, witnessing the event, or it could be a depiction of a saint's birth or a miraculous event.",
