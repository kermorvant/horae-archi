    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a queen or noblewoman, is depicted in profile, wearing an elaborate headdress and a richly decorated garment. She holds a shallow bowl or dish in her hands. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative foliage. The overall style suggests a medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The image does not contain enough elements to definitively interpret a specific religious, biblical, liturgical, or devotional meaning. It appears to be a portrait or a scene from a secular narrative, or a symbolic representation not immediately recognizable without further context.",
