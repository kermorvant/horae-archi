    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ's body, pale and lifeless, is being carefully lowered by several figures. A man in a white robe supports Christ's torso, while another figure in yellow holds his arm. To the left, a woman in a blue mantle, likely the Virgin Mary, looks on with sorrow, her hand touching Christ's side. Another woman in pink, possibly Mary Magdalene, is also present. Below, a man in an orange tunic and apron uses pincers to remove nails from Christ's feet, with a hammer lying nearby. The background is a rich blue with stylized foliage, and a wooden cross stands prominently, bearing the INRI inscription. The overall atmosphere is one of grief and solemnity.",
