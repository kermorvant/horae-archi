    "scene_description_enriched": "Two angels, depicted with white robes and large wings, are shown in a celestial setting against a deep blue background dotted with stars. The angel on the left plays a recorder-like instrument, while the angel on the right plays a vielle (a medieval stringed instrument). Both angels appear to be in motion, with the one on the right kneeling or in a dynamic pose. The scene evokes a heavenly choir or a celestial celebration.",
