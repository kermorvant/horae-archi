    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a humble, rustic structure, possibly a stable, suggested by the wooden beams and thatched roof. The Virgin Mary, seated on a red cushion, cradles the Christ Child, who is reaching out. Three Magi are present: one kneels before the child, offering a gift; another, crowned and in red, holds a vessel; and the third, in blue and red, looks upwards towards a radiant sun. In the background, a town with spires and towers is visible under a bright blue sky. The overall scene is rich with color and gold leaf, characteristic of manuscript illumination.",
