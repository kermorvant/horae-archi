    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint, stands in a landscape holding an open book. She wears a halo, indicating her sanctity, and her attire suggests a medieval noblewoman. Behind her, to the left, are rows of what appear to be barrels or large containers, possibly in a field or vineyard. To the right, a fortified structure with towers and crenellations is visible on a hill. Scattered in the foreground and midground are arrows, suggesting a narrative of martyrdom or conflict. The overall scene depicts a saint in a setting that combines elements of rural life and military architecture, possibly alluding to her life or martyrdom.",
