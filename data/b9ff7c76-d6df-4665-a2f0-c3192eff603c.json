    "scene_description_enriched": "An elderly man with a long beard, wearing a blue robe and a green and gold headdress, sits on a stool in an interior space. He is holding a book and appears to be reading or writing. In front of him is a wooden desk with several books and a scroll. A fire burns in a hearth to his left, and a bundle of firewood lies nearby. The room is framed by architectural elements, including large columns and arches, with a view of a landscape through an opening. The scene likely depicts a scholar or a religious figure engaged in study or contemplation, possibly a representation of Saint Jerome in his study, given the presence of books and the solitary, studious atmosphere.",
