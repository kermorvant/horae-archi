    "scene_description_enriched": "Two shepherds are depicted in a grassy, hilly landscape under a starry blue sky. The shepherd on the left, wearing a blue tunic and red cap, plays a hornpipe. He points upwards with his right hand. The shepherd on the right, in a yellow tunic and green cap, leans on a staff and also looks upwards. Three sheep are visible grazing between them. Above them, an angel with orange wings descends from a cloud-like formation, holding a banner that reads \"Puer natus est nobis hodie in Bethlem\" (A child is born to us today in Bethlehem). Golden rays emanate from the angel towards the shepherds and the landscape.",
