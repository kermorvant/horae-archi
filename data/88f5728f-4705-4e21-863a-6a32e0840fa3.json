Three Magi, identified by their crowns, approach. One Magus, kneeling and dressed in red and ermine, offers a golden chalice. Another Magus, in green, also holds a chalice. The third Magus, in blue, stands and holds a chalice. Behind them, a simple thatched structure with visible wooden beams suggests a stable or humble dwelling. The background features a green, hilly landscape with trees and a woven fence. Rays of light emanate from a celestial orb above.",
