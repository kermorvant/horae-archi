    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, cloaked and veiled, cradles the Christ Child in her arms. They are accompanied by Saint Joseph, who wears a hat and a cloak, and appears to be leading a donkey, though the animal is only partially visible. To the left, a figure in a tunic and helmet stands beside a column, possibly representing a guard or a symbolic figure. The background features a landscape with trees and distant buildings, suggesting an outdoor setting. The inscription \"AD VESPERIS OFFICIVM\" is visible at the top, indicating the time of Vespers, a canonical hour in Christian liturgy.",
