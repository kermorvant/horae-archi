    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely Moses, wading through turbulent waters, leaning heavily on a staff. Above him, a radiant angel, possibly Gabriel, descends from a golden, patterned sky, holding a chalice. To the left, a small building with a red roof and a figure looking upwards suggests a dwelling or sanctuary. The landscape is rendered with green, rocky hills and sparse trees. The overall composition suggests a divine intervention or revelation occurring in a natural setting.",
