    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child across a body of water. Saint Christopher, a large, bearded man with long, dark hair, is shown wading through water, supporting himself with a staff. He wears a dark robe. The Christ Child, with a halo, sits on Saint Christopher's shoulders, raising one hand in blessing. The background suggests a natural setting with trees and possibly a rocky bank. The overall impression is one of arduous travel and divine protection.",
