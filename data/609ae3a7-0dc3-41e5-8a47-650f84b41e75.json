A haloed Virgin Mary, dressed in dark robes, kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Beside her, a haloed infant Christ lies on the ground, with a wound on his chest. To the left, a haloed man, likely Saint Joseph, dressed in a monk's habit, stands holding a staff. Behind them, a donkey is visible. In the background, a town with buildings and a church tower is depicted under a dark sky with celestial bodies. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
