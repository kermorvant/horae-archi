    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross as the central figure. To the left stands a sorrowful woman, likely the Virgin Mary, draped in dark robes and with her head bowed. To the right, another figure, possibly Saint John the Evangelist, gazes upwards towards Christ, holding a book. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sacred status. The background is a textured, muted color, and the entire scene is framed by a decorative border with geometric patterns and small ornamental elements at the corners. The ground beneath the figures is depicted as rough and uneven.",
