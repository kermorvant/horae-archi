    "scene_description_enriched": "A jester, dressed in a pink, pointed hat and a pink tunic adorned with bells and fur trim, walks across a green, hilly landscape. He wears orange and blue stockings and dark shoes. He carries a staff topped with a carved skull and holds an apple in his left hand, bringing it to his mouth. A banner unfurls above him, inscribed with the Latin phrase 'non est deus' (there is no god). In the background, a fortified city with towers and crenellated walls is visible on a hill, under a pale blue sky with wispy clouds.",
