    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men in a pastoral setting, indicated by the green ground with scattered yellow plants. The central figure, adorned in a blue robe with red trim and a white sash, wears a distinctive white headdress and a green sash draped over his shoulders. He gestures with his right hand. To his left, another man in a blue robe with gold trim points towards the central figure. To the right, two men in blue robes with red undergarments and gold trim are shown. One of them has his hands clasped in prayer, while the other is partially obscured. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of red, blue, gold, and white squares. The text above reads 'lenou Dieu', suggesting a religious context.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a biblical or devotional event, possibly related to a figure of authority or prophecy. The gesture of the central figure and the prayerful posture of one of the onlookers suggest a moment of communication, blessing, or prophecy. The text 'lenou Dieu' (likely 'l'envoi Dieu' or similar, meaning 'God sends') further supports a divine or spiritual narrative.",
