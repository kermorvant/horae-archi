    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pietà, with the Virgin Mary cradling the lifeless body of Christ after his crucifixion. Christ, with wounds visible, is laid across Mary's lap. Mary, wearing a white veil and a blue mantle over a golden robe, gazes down at her son with sorrow. Behind them, a golden cross stands against a landscape of rolling hills, a body of water, and stylized trees. The entire scene is framed by an architectural element resembling a golden archway with decorative columns on either side.",
