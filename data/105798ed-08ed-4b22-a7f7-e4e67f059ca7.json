    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely God the Father, holding a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, and supporting a crucified Christ. Christ is depicted in a foreshortened manner, with his arms outstretched on the cross. Surrounding this central tableau are several cherubic figures, some with wings, looking towards the central event. The background is a dark, patterned fabric, possibly a tapestry or drapery, with decorative borders at the top and sides. Two architectural elements resembling ornate pedestals or altars are visible at the bottom corners, flanking the central figures. The overall impression is one of divine intervention and the sacrifice of Christ.",
