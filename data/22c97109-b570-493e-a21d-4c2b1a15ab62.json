    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint or queen, stands centrally, adorned in a rich red gown with gold star-like embellishments and a white fur-lined mantle. She wears a golden crown and has a golden halo. In her left hand, she holds a golden reliquary or monstrance. The background features a decorative tiled wall with alternating gold, blue, and patterned squares, flanked by two blue panels that suggest doorways or curtains. The floor is depicted with a patterned tile design. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior setting, possibly a chapel or a royal chamber.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's regalia (crown, halo) and the presence of a reliquary suggest she is a saintly queen or a venerated female figure, possibly a martyr or a virgin saint. The reliquary indicates devotion and the veneration of relics.",
