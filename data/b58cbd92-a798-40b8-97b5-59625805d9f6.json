    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape within a quatrefoil frame. Several deer, including fawns, are resting or grazing in a grassy area. Above them, a bird is depicted in flight, and a larger, indistinct animal, possibly a lion or a dog, is also present. The background features a grid-like pattern, suggesting a stylized representation of a woven net or a patterned cloth, possibly indicating a celestial or symbolic setting. The overall impression is one of peaceful nature and perhaps divine protection.",
