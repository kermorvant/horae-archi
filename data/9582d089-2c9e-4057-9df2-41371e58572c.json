    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure with long, wavy hair, wearing a simple garment, is seated on a cushioned surface, possibly a bench or a low wall. The figure is reaching up towards a tree with branches laden with round fruits, and appears to be plucking or eating one. The background is filled with stippling, suggesting a starry sky or a dense foliage. The scene is framed by decorative borders, with stylized leaves and circular motifs. The overall impression is one of a pastoral or idyllic setting, possibly depicting a moment of simple pleasure or contemplation.",
