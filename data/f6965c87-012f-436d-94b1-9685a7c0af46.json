    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures surrounding a seated individual whose eyes are covered with a white cloth. The seated figure, wearing a blue cloak and a golden halo, is positioned on an ornate, gilded chair. Several other figures, dressed in colorful garments (green, blue, and orange), are actively engaged with the central figure. One figure in blue, wearing a red cap, places hands over the eyes of the seated person. Another figure in green, to the left, raises a hand. A figure in orange, to the right, also raises a hand and points. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of small, colorful squares in blue, red, green, and gold, framed by a decorative border with floral motifs. The floor is also patterned with red and yellow squares and circles. The overall impression is one of mockery or humiliation.",
