    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and bleeding from his wounds. Below the cross, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe and red mantle, mourns with her hands clasped. To her right, another figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also looks up at Christ with sorrow, draped in a white and pink garment. The background is a textured, dark pattern with gold flecks, suggesting a divine or symbolic space, with a hint of green ground at the bottom.",
