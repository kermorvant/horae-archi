    "scene_description_enriched": "A young man with a golden halo, dressed in a blue robe and pink mantle, is seated outdoors, writing on a scroll with a quill. He is depicted in a contemplative pose, with his head bowed. To his left, a stylized tree with green foliage stands against a blue, speckled background. To his right, a golden, abstract form suggests a rocky outcrop or a divine presence. A golden bird is depicted in flight near the tree. The scene is rendered with vibrant colors and gold leaf, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
