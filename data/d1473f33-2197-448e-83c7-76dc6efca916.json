    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king seated on a throne, wearing a crown and a blue robe trimmed with white fur. He holds a scepter in his right hand. Before him stand three figures. The central figure, dressed in a red tunic and a flowing brown cloak, has a halo and appears to be speaking. To his left, another figure with a halo, dressed in blue, looks towards the king. Between the central figure and the king stands a man in a green tunic and hood, holding a staff. The background is a rich red tapestry with a repeating gold pattern. The king's throne is elevated on a golden dais. This scene likely represents a biblical narrative, possibly a king receiving a prophet or a supplicant.",
