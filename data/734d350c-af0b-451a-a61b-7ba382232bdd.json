    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man, likely Saint Christopher, is depicted seated on a rocky, grassy outcrop by the water's edge. He wears a blue tunic and a red cloak, and a dark, wide-brimmed hat. His head is bowed, resting on his hand, and he holds a staff. A satchel lies beside him. In the background, a body of water with sailing vessels and smaller boats is visible. Beyond the water, a walled city with towers and spires, and cranes suggesting construction, is depicted on a hill. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
