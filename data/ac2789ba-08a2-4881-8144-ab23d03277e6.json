    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with his body rendered in a stylized manner, showing wounds. To the left, a figure in a black habit, likely the Virgin Mary, stands with hands clasped in prayer, her face downcast. To the right, another figure, possibly Saint John the Evangelist, stands with a book in hand, looking towards Christ with a pensive expression. The figures are set against a decorative background of foliage and are framed by an arched border. The ground beneath them is depicted with stylized grass and plants.",
