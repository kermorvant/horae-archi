    "scene_description_enriched": "A man kneels in a golden robe, holding a sheaf of wheat. He looks upwards with a pained expression. Above him, in a blue, cloud-filled sky, a figure resembling Christ, with a beard and halo, looks down with hands clasped in prayer. In the background, a winding path leads through a green landscape towards a stone castle on a hill. The scene depicts a moment of supplication and divine observation.",
