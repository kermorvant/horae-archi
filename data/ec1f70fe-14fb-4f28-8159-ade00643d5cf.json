    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic and symbolic struggle between good and evil. On the right, a group of figures, including the Virgin Mary and possibly other holy women or angels, are bathed in divine light emanating from above. One figure, likely the Virgin Mary, is shown in prayer, her hands clasped. To the left, a multitude of demons and monstrous creatures are depicted in a dark, thorny thicket, some wielding weapons. One demon appears to be attacking or tormenting another. The overall impression is one of spiritual warfare, with the forces of good confronting the forces of evil.",
