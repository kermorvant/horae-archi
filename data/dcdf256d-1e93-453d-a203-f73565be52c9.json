    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony taking place within a richly decorated church interior. Several figures, some in black monastic habits and others in blue robes with golden mantles, are gathered around a central altar. The altar is adorned with red drapery and surmounted by a golden canopy. Behind the altar, a large, ornate golden screen with intricate tracery separates the altar area from the background, which features tall, Gothic-style windows and architectural elements suggesting a grand ecclesiastical setting. The figures appear to be engaged in prayer or reading from a text, emphasizing the devotional nature of the scene.",
