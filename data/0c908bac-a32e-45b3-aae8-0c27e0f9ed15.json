To the left, an elderly man with a long white beard, dressed in a golden robe and white mantle, kneels and offers a golden chalice. Behind him, a younger man in a red cap and yellow tunic holds a golden reliquary. To the right of Mary, a man in a green tunic and purple leggings, wearing a purple cap, stands with his hands on his hips, holding a golden chalice. Behind him, another man with a beard and brown robe is partially visible. The background is dark and appears to be a rough, rocky or earthen setting, with some suggestion of architectural elements or a cave-like structure above. The ground is rendered in earthy tones with some green vegetation.",
