    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ. Christ, with a crown of thorns and wounds, is being nailed to a wooden cross by two men. One man, in an orange tunic, hammers a nail into Christ's hand, while another man, in a blue tunic and red leggings, secures Christ's arm with a rope. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, is seated and appears distressed, with another figure, possibly St. John, beside her. In the background, a crowd of onlookers, some on horseback, are gathered, and in the far distance, a city with spires and towers is visible. The ground is green and uneven, suggesting a hillside.",
