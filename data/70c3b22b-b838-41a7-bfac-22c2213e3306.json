    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition from the Cross. Christ, with a halo and crown of thorns, is being lowered from the cross. Two figures on ladders assist in this process, one supporting Christ's body and the other holding his arm. Another figure, possibly Joseph of Arimathea, stands below with a white cloth, ready to receive the body. To the left, a group of mourners, including the Virgin Mary in a blue mantle and a woman in red, observe the scene with hands clasped in prayer. In the background, a walled city with towers is visible amidst rolling green hills and a pale blue sky. The overall composition is framed by a decorative border.",
