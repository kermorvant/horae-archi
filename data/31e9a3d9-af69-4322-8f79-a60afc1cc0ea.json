    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ emerging from a sarcophagus, triumphantly holding a banner with a cross. He is surrounded by two soldiers, one on each side, who appear to be guarding or witnessing his resurrection. The soldier on the left holds a large axe, while the soldier on the right holds a spear. Christ is depicted with a halo and a red cloak draped over his shoulders, pointing upwards with his right hand. The sarcophagus is ornate, with circular motifs on its side. The background is a landscape with rolling hills and trees under a blue sky. This imagery represents the Resurrection of Christ, a central event in Christian theology.",
