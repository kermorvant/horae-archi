    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A bearded elder, dressed in green, presents the Christ Child to a kneeling figure, presumably Simeon, who is dressed in blue and has a halo. The Christ Child is naked and held aloft. Behind Simeon, a woman in a red habit with a white wimple looks on with a concerned expression. To the left of the Virgin Mary, another woman in red holds a basket. The figures are positioned in an interior space with a richly patterned red textile behind them. Above this, a grand architectural structure is visible, featuring multiple arches supported by columns, and topped with domes and spires, suggesting a temple or church setting. The background shows mountains and sky.",
