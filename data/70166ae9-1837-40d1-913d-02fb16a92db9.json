    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist seated outdoors on rocky terrain, with a body of water and distant hills in the background. He is shown with a halo, holding a quill and a scroll, and looking upwards as if in divine inspiration. To his left, a bird, likely an eagle, stands on the ground holding a small object in its beak. The landscape is rendered with trees and a body of water, suggesting a natural, contemplative setting. The figure's attire is rich, with a patterned gold tunic and a purple mantle. The overall impression is one of spiritual contemplation and divine revelation.",
