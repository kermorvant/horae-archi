    "scene_description_enriched": "A young woman with long, flowing blonde hair and a golden halo is depicted with her eyes closed and hands clasped in prayer. She is shown from the chest up, with her torso bare. She appears to be leaning forward, resting her arms on a surface covered with a green cloth. Behind her, the background is dark and indistinct, suggesting an interior space. To the right, a small, ornate vessel, possibly a chalice or reliquary, is visible. The overall impression is one of piety and contemplation.",
