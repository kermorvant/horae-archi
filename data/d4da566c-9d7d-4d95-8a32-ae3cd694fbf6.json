    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a saint or prophet, kneeling with hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. Behind this figure is a stylized tree. In the upper right, a divine figure, possibly God the Father or a prophet, is depicted within a cloud-like form, also looking down. Below and to the right of the praying figure, a group of smaller figures, possibly representing a congregation or disciples, are gathered. The overall setting appears to be outdoors, with a rocky or uneven ground and sparse vegetation. The scene is framed by an arched border, typical of manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of divine revelation or intercession, possibly a vision or a prayer being answered. The praying figure could be a prophet receiving divine inspiration or a saint interceding. The presence of the divine figure above and the gathered smaller figures below suggests a connection between the heavenly and earthly realms, or a moment of communal spiritual experience.",
