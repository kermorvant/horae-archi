    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in conversation, with one, dressed in blue, reaching out to touch the hands of the other, who is clad in a pink robe and white veil. The figures are positioned in an outdoor setting with a wooden fence and some foliage to the left, and buildings to the right. The architecture includes a pink building with visible windows and a grey stone structure with a large arched opening. The overall impression is one of a tender encounter between two individuals.",
