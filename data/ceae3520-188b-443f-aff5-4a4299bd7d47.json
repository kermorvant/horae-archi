    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, wavy blonde hair, adorned with a green and red patterned headband, is depicted. She wears a red beaded necklace and a richly colored garment with gold, pink, and green accents, layered over a white sleeve. Her right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or speech, while her left hand holds a cylindrical object decorated with red and white geometric patterns. The background features a muted blue-green wall with a repeating pattern of stylized red motifs, and a golden initial 'O' in the upper right corner. The overall impression is one of devotional contemplation or a saintly representation.",
