    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman, likely Saint Anne, seated and holding a book or psalter, with an open book and a closed book on a round table beside her. To her right, a younger woman, possibly the Virgin Mary, approaches with a gesture of reverence or inquiry. Behind Saint Anne is a structure resembling a hearth or a small building with a chimney. The background is rendered as a draped fabric or tapestry, suggesting an indoor setting. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
