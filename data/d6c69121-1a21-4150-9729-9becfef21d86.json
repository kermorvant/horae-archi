    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child, also with a halo. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a red garment. Joseph, with a red hat and beard, walks beside the donkey, leaning on a staff and carrying a bundle on his back. They are traversing a hilly, green landscape with sparse trees. In the background, a windmill stands on a hill, and a small figure is visible on a distant path. Above the scene, within an arched frame decorated with gold and blue patterns, a bearded figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted with a radiant halo, emerging from blue clouds.",
