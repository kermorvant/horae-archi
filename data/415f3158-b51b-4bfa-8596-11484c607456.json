    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with rolling green hills, a winding river, and a walled city in the background. In the foreground, three figures are present: a woman in blue and pink, seated and cradling a lamb; a man in a blue tunic and pink hose, holding a shepherd's crook and looking upwards; and another figure, also in pink, holding a crook and gazing skyward. Above them, an angel with wings and a halo, clad in orange, flies on a white scroll, seemingly descending from the sky. Sheep are scattered across the hillsides, and a dark-colored dog rests near the seated woman. The overall impression is one of a peaceful, idyllic rural setting, possibly representing a biblical narrative or a devotional scene.",
