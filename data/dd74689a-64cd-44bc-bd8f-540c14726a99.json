    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded king, wearing a crown and regal attire, is depicted from the chest up. He holds a bunch of grapes in his left hand and gestures with his right hand, palms facing outwards in a gesture of blessing or supplication. The figure is framed by architectural elements suggesting a niche or a decorative architectural surround, with a textured background. The scene is likely a devotional image, possibly representing a king in prayer or a symbolic representation of royalty and abundance.",
