    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, in an orange gown and blue mantle, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies on a blue cloth. Rays of golden light descend from above, symbolizing divine intervention. To the left, Saint Joseph, with hands clasped in prayer, looks down at the scene. Several cherubic angels, some with wings and halos, are also present, some kneeling in adoration and others looking towards the divine light. Behind them, an arched opening reveals a landscape with buildings and a distant city. The architecture is characterized by brick walls, arched openings, and a wooden roof structure. A window with a plant is visible in the background on the right.",
