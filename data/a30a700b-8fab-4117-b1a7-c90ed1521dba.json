The Virgin Mary is dressed in a blue robe and has a golden halo. The Christ Child, depicted as a naked infant with a halo, is held between the two women. The older woman, likely Saint Anne, is kneeling and wearing a blue-grey habit and a white veil. Both women are seated or kneeling on a red carpeted surface, against a backdrop of a red curtain and grey walls. The overall setting suggests a devotional or domestic interior.",
