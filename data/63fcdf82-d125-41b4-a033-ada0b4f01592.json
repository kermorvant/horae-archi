    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve stand naked, each holding a fig leaf to cover themselves. A serpent, depicted with human-like wings and a woman's upper body, coils around a tree, offering an apple to Eve. The background features a body of water and a distant castle, suggesting a pastoral landscape. This illustration represents the moment of temptation and the subsequent sin that led to humanity's expulsion from paradise.",
