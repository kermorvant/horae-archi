    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a scribe or scholar, engrossed in writing at a desk. The figure is seated and draped in a blue robe with gold embellishments, leaning over a manuscript. The desk is ornate, with compartments and books. Behind the scribe, a complex architectural structure is visible, featuring pointed arches, columns, and red-tiled vaulted ceilings, suggesting a Gothic style. Above and to the right, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted with a halo and rays of light emanating from him, gesturing with his hand. The background is a deep blue, patterned with gold rays and stylized foliage. The overall impression is one of divine inspiration or revelation occurring within an architectural setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the inspiration of a prophet or evangelist, possibly St. John the Evangelist, receiving divine revelation. The presence of God the Father above, the act of writing, and the architectural setting evoke the moment of divine dictation or vision.",
