    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by a halo, stands in a grassy landscape. She is dressed in a blue patterned surcoat over a red gown, both adorned with gold trim and pearls. She holds an open golden vessel, possibly an ointment jar, in her hands. In the background, a rocky cliff face is depicted with several small buildings nestled into its side, suggesting a monastic or hermitic settlement. Further in the distance, rolling hills and more buildings are visible under a pale blue sky.",
