    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a ritualistic circumcision of a child, likely representing the Presentation of Christ in the Temple or a similar Old Testament event. Three figures are present: one holding the child, another preparing to perform the circumcision with a knife, and a third observing. The child lies on a draped table, with a golden halo indicating divinity. The setting appears to be an interior space with a red, star-patterned tapestry behind the figures and a checkered floor. Architectural elements include an arched opening to the left, suggesting an adjacent room or exterior, and a column supporting an overhead structure. The overall atmosphere is solemn and ceremonial.",
