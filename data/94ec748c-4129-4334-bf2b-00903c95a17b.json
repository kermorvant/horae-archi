    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a decorative, quatrefoil frame. On the left, a person in a white monastic habit with a cowl kneels, gesturing with their right hand and looking towards the other figure. Before them is an open book resting on a green cloth. On the right, a bearded man, also in monastic attire, stands holding an open book in his left hand and a staff in his right. He is surrounded by flames, suggesting martyrdom or divine trial. The background is a blue grid pattern with gold accents, and above the kneeling figure is an orange, conical object. The overall setting appears to be a stylized, possibly metaphysical space, indicated by the lack of conventional architecture and the symbolic elements.",
