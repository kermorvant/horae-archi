    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession of figures in a hilly, outdoor landscape. In the foreground, a young woman with a halo holds a staff and looks to the right. To her left, a bearded man, also with a halo, kneels and holds a staff. Behind him, another bearded man peers over a hill. To the right of the woman, an elderly bearded man with a halo looks upwards and holds a staff. The figures appear to be part of a religious procession or pilgrimage, suggested by their halos and staffs, and the landscape setting. Above the scene, a decorative banner displays Latin text, possibly from a psalm or liturgical chant, which reads 'annuntiaabit laudem tuam' (will announce your praise).",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a procession of saints or holy figures, possibly related to a psalm or devotional text that speaks of praise and proclamation. The text 'annuntiaabit laudem tuam' directly supports this interpretation, suggesting a theme of divine praise.",
