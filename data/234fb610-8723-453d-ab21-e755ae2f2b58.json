    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, stands to the right, dressed in a red robe and a blue mantle adorned with gold trim. He holds his hands in a gesture of blessing or prayer. To the left, three unclothed figures, likely martyrs, are depicted within a wooden tub or vat, their hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, an arched opening reveals a glimpse of a landscape with blue hills and green foliage. The background behind the bishop is a red tapestry decorated with gold stars and asterisks. The scene appears to depict a saintly figure interacting with those undergoing martyrdom or purification.",
