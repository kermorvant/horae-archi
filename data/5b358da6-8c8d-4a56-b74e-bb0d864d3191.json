    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a dramatic moment in a celestial setting. At the top, a bearded figure, likely God, is shown with a halo, raising his hand and holding a golden orb, with rays of light emanating from him. Below, three figures are engaged in a struggle. One figure, dressed in pink, holds a sword aloft, seemingly about to strike another figure who is kneeling and being touched on the head. Two other figures, one in brown and another in blue, appear to be restraining or assisting in the action. The background is a deep blue sky filled with golden clouds. In the foreground, on a wooden platform, are two golden vessels: a chalice and a pitcher. The overall composition suggests a divine intervention or judgment.",
