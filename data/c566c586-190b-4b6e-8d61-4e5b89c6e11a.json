    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony or blessing. A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and ornate blue cope, holds a red book and raises his hand in a gesture of blessing or instruction. He is accompanied by another figure, likely a saint or apostle, also with a halo, wearing a green robe and holding a red book. In the foreground, three men in blue robes kneel, their hands clasped in prayer or supplication. Above, a hand emerges from a golden disc, pointing downwards, suggesting divine intervention or approval. The background is a rich red tapestry with gold patterns, and the ground is depicted as green with stylized vegetation.",
