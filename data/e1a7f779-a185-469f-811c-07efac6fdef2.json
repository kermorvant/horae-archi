    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men are depicted in profile, seated and looking upwards. They are dressed in simple robes, with their arms crossed over their chests. The figures are rendered in a stylized, linear fashion, typical of woodcut illustrations. The scene appears to be set outdoors, suggested by the absence of any architectural elements and the open space implied by the composition. The men's upward gaze and clasped hands suggest a moment of prayer, contemplation, or anticipation, possibly within a devotional context.",
