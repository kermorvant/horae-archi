    "scene_description_enriched": "A central figure, likely Christ, is seated on a throne-like structure. He has a halo with red rays and is wearing a blue robe over a red garment. Two figures attend to him: one on the left, kneeling and holding a horn to Christ's ear, and another on the right, also kneeling and holding a whip-like object. The background is a vibrant blue, with the throne rendered in gold and red stripes. The scene appears to be a symbolic representation rather than a literal depiction of a specific architectural setting.",
