    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint or a noblewoman, stands holding an open book in her hands. She wears a golden robe and a headdress. To her left, a smaller figure of a man with a beard and a blue and yellow cap is depicted kneeling or seated. The background features a red tapestry with gold motifs and a dark, possibly wooden, architectural element above. The scene appears to be set within an interior space, suggested by the tapestry and the implied enclosure.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a devotional or hagiographic subject, possibly a saint known for her piety and learning, as indicated by the open book. The presence of a supplicant figure suggests a moment of prayer or petition.",
