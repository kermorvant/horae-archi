    "scene_description_enriched": "Two nude children, likely representing Adam and Eve before the Fall, are depicted in a lush, green landscape filled with foliage and small flowers. The child on the left, with reddish-blonde hair, holds a round, brown object, possibly a fruit or a representation of the forbidden fruit. The child on the right, with blonde hair, looks towards the viewer. Bare trees with thin branches are visible in the background against a blue sky. The scene evokes a sense of innocence and the natural world before the introduction of sin.",
