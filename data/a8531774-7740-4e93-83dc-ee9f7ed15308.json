    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Last Judgment. Christ, with wounds visible on his chest and hands, sits enthroned on a globe, surrounded by a rainbow and a richly patterned red background. Two angels with trumpets are positioned above him. Below, on a green ground, figures emerge from the earth, some in prayer, others reaching upwards. To the left, a kneeling figure in a blue robe, likely the Virgin Mary, looks up at Christ. To the right, a bearded man in a golden robe, possibly a saint or a supplicant, also kneels in prayer. The overall composition suggests a divine judgment where souls are being resurrected and judged.",
