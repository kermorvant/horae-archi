    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue mantle, cradles the Christ Child. Before them kneels a figure in a dark robe, possibly representing a king or a devout observer. To the left, a young boy in white attire holds a chalice and a green disc. To the right, two figures, one in a red robe and blue hood, and another in a patterned robe and hat, approach. The background features a golden tapestry and an open architectural structure with visible wooden beams and a blue sky beyond. A small, ornate vessel sits on the ground in the foreground.",
