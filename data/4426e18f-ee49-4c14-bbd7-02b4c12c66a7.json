    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary seated and reading from an open book placed on a lectern. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a grey tunic. Facing her, the Angel Gabriel kneels, gesturing towards her with his right hand and holding a golden staff topped with a fleur-de-lis. The angel has blue wings and wears a golden tunic and a red cloak. Above and behind them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The figures are framed by an architectural structure with decorative elements, suggesting an interior space, possibly a room or a loggia, with a background of grey vertical panels.",
