    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in an outdoor setting under a starry, blue sky. In the center, a person kneels with hands clasped in prayer, wearing a blue robe adorned with gold trim and a golden headband. To the left, another figure in a reddish-brown tunic and gold-trimmed leggings raises a fist and holds something white in their other hand. To the right, a third figure, wearing a dark tunic and a red hat, raises a chalice-like object and holds a white object. Golden streaks descend from the sky, suggesting divine intervention or a celestial event. The ground is depicted as green with some texture.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a miracle or a divine event, possibly related to a saint or a biblical narrative where divine light or intervention is depicted. The kneeling figure in prayer suggests supplication or receiving a divine blessing. The figures on either side might be witnesses or participants in the event. The golden streaks from the sky are a common iconographic element for divine light or grace.",
