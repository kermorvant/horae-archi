    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, dressed in a richly decorated golden robe with a white and gold patterned collar and a pale blue sash, kneels on a textured yellow ground. His hands are raised in supplication, and his gaze is directed upwards. To his right, a harp-like musical instrument lies on the ground, along with a blue, pointed cap adorned with gold dots and a staff. In the background, a brick wall separates the foreground from a body of water, beyond which lies a complex of buildings with varied rooflines and towers, rendered in shades of pink and grey. Above the buildings, a divine figure with a long white beard and flowing hair, wearing a red garment, appears within a golden halo or cloud formation against a blue sky.",
