    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a jeweled crown and a bishop's miter, indicating he is a high-ranking religious figure, possibly a king or a saintly bishop. He holds a globus cruciger (orb and cross) in his left hand, symbolizing dominion over the world. His right hand is raised, possibly in blessing or teaching. He is surrounded by four eight-pointed stars, set against a plain background. The figure's attire includes a richly decorated collar and a cape. The overall impression is one of authority and divine representation.",
