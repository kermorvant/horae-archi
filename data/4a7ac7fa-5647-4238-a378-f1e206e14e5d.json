    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the Virgin Mary cradling the body of Jesus in her lap. Several figures surround them, appearing to mourn. To the left, a man with a beard and head covering supports Christ's legs. To the right, a woman with a veil and a man with a beard and head covering are also present. The figures are enclosed within an architectural frame that suggests a niche or a stylized archway, with decorative elements at the top. The overall composition is somber and evokes a sense of grief and reverence.",
