    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the body of Christ, bearing wounds from crucifixion, laid in a sarcophagus. He is supported by several mourners. On the left, a man in a blue robe and a distinctive red and yellow conical hat looks down at Christ. Beside him, a woman in a red robe with her arms crossed grieves. To the right of Christ, the Virgin Mary, clad in blue, cradles Christ's head and wipes away a tear. Another woman, also in blue, leans in to comfort her. On the far right, a man in a yellow robe and a white and red headdress looks towards Christ. In the background, a stylized cityscape with towers and spires is visible, set against a green, grassy landscape.",
