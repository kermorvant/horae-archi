    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within an architectural setting that suggests a stable or humble dwelling. The Virgin Mary, adorned with a golden halo, tenderly holds the Christ Child, who is also haloed. One of the Magi, kneeling and wearing a red robe, presents a golden chalice to the infant. Two other Magi, crowned and richly dressed in green and blue respectively, stand behind, holding their gifts. An older man with a white beard, possibly Joseph or a prophet, is seated to the left, observing the scene. The background features a blue sky with a star, and a simple wooden structure with draped fabric suggests the enclosure.",
