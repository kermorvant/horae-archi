    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flight into Egypt, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her halo and blue mantle, carrying the Christ Child on a donkey. She is guided by a man, likely Joseph, who holds the donkey's reins. The figures are set against a landscape with rolling hills, rocky outcrops, and a body of water. In the background, a city with towers and buildings is visible, suggesting their destination or origin. To the right, a solitary figure stands on a pedestal, possibly representing a pagan idol being overthrown by the Holy Family's arrival, a common iconographic motif in this narrative. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
