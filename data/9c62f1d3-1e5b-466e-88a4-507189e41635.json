    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, crowned and with a halo, is depicted nursing the Christ Child. She wears a red gown and a blue mantle. The child, wrapped in a white cloth, is seated on a green, gold-patterned cushion held by the Virgin. They are positioned in what appears to be an interior space with a dark, textured background, possibly a wall or drapery, and a window or opening revealing architectural elements with Gothic tracery windows. The scene evokes a tender moment of maternal care and divine nourishment.",
