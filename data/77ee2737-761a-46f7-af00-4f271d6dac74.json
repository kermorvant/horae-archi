    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely a saint, stands in a landscape. He has a beard and long hair, and is dressed in a tunic and a dark cloak. He holds an open book in his left hand and a T-shaped object, possibly a carpenter's square or a symbol of martyrdom, in his right. The background depicts rolling hills, scattered trees, and in the distance, a cluster of buildings including a church with a tower. The sky is filled with dark, stylized clouds. The overall scene suggests a devotional image of a saint in a pastoral setting, possibly representing Saint Jude Thaddeus, known for his association with carpentry and his martyrdom.",
