    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, likely Christ, stands centrally, depicted with a halo and long, flowing hair and beard. He wears a golden tunic beneath a rich red mantle. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing, while his left hand holds a lyre, and above it, a cross. The background is a blue sky with hints of clouds, and a green landscape with some indistinct dark forms. The figure is presented in a devotional manner, suggesting a representation of Christ as the Psalmist or a symbolic figure of divine music and salvation.",
