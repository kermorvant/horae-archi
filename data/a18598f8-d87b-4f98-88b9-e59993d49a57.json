    "scene_description_enriched": "Two men are depicted in a field, engaged in agricultural labor. The man on the left, wearing a dark cap and tunic, is bent over, using a tool that appears to be a hoe or spade to work the soil. The man on the right, in a lighter tunic, is also kneeling and seems to be tending to the plants. The setting is a field with dry stalks or stubble, suggesting a harvest or post-harvest activity. The scene is framed by a decorative border of gold vines and blue and red floral elements.",
