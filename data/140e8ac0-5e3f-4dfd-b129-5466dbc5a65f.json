    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child across a body of water. Saint Christopher, a large bearded man, is shown wading through the water, holding a tall staff for support. He wears a blue tunic and a red cloak. The Christ Child, with a halo and a cross, is seated on Saint Christopher's shoulders, holding a globe. The background features a turbulent blue sky with golden rays, suggesting divine presence, and a distant, indistinct cityscape with towers. Rocky outcrops frame the scene on either side, and the water is rendered with blue and white strokes.",
