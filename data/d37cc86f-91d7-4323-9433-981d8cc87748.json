    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel, depicted with golden wings and a halo, descends from a radiant blue sky, holding a golden scroll inscribed with Latin text. Below, in a pastoral landscape dotted with sheep, a shepherd in a red tunic plays a bagpipe, looking upwards. Two other shepherds, one in yellow and green, the other in a purple cloak, also gaze towards the angel, one pointing. A dog lies at the feet of the bagpipe player. In the background, a fortified city or castle is visible on a rocky outcrop. The scene likely depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a pivotal moment in the Nativity narrative.",
