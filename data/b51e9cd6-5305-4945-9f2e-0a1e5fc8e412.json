    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross in the center. To his left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, kneels with her hands clasped in sorrow. To his right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, stands with his hands outstretched in a gesture of grief or supplication. The figures are set against a blue sky and a rocky, uneven ground. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, gilded architectural border, suggesting it is an illustration within a manuscript.",
