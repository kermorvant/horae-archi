    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable structure. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and white veil, kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Beside her, a figure in a red robe, likely Saint Joseph, leans towards the Christ Child lying on the ground. An ox and a donkey are visible behind them. The background features a green, hilly landscape with trees. Rays of light emanate from the upper part of the image, suggesting divine presence. The overall composition is framed by an arched border with floral motifs.",
