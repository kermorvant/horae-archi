    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a bishop, stands within a decorative initial 'B'. The figure wears a white mitre, a blue cope over a red garment, and a white alb. They hold a crozier in their right hand and raise their left hand in a gesture of blessing. The background features a wall of blue bricks and a patterned tapestry above. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. The scene is framed by the ornate red and gold initial 'B', suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
