    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an indoor setting with a patterned background. In the foreground, two figures are engaged in an action, one on the left wearing a tunic and hose, and another on the right in a robe. Between them, a scroll or banner is held aloft by a figure from above, possibly an angel, with the inscription \"AMEN\" visible. To the right, another figure, possibly a dog, is present, and below, there are representations of animals, possibly sheep or lambs. The overall impression is one of a narrative scene, possibly religious or allegorical, with symbolic elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of the inscription \"AMEN\" and the depiction of animals, potentially lambs, along with figures in what could be religious attire, suggests a scene related to prayer, devotion, or a biblical narrative. Without further context or clearer iconography, a precise interpretation is difficult, but it likely relates to a devotional practice or a moment from scripture.",
