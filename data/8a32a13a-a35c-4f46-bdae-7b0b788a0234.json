    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women, both with golden halos, engaged in an embrace or greeting. The woman on the right wears a deep blue robe adorned with gold patterns and a white veil. Her halo is radiant. The woman on the left is dressed in a vibrant orange-red robe and a white head covering. They are positioned in a grassy area, with a textured, checkered background of gold, blue, and red squares behind them. To the right, a stylized, light-colored form, possibly representing a hill or a cloud, is visible. The overall impression is one of tenderness and spiritual significance, likely representing a biblical encounter.",
