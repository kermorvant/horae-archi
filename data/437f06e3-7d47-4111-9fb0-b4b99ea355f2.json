    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue, presents the Christ Child to an elderly man, likely Simeon, who is dressed in a golden robe. To the left of Mary stands a man in a pink robe, possibly Joseph, holding two doves. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by pink colonnades and arches, with a gold patterned background. On the right side, a woman in a white veil gestures, and a chalice and a book are visible on a surface, suggesting the ritualistic context of the event. The floor is decorated with a black and white checkered pattern.",
