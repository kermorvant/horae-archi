    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, dressed in a red robe and a green turban-like hat, stands behind a table covered with a yellow cloth. He holds a sword in his right hand, pointing it towards a circular medallion on the table. The medallion depicts a figure, likely Christ, with arms outstretched, surrounded by stars and what appear to be wounds. The background features a blue starry sky and glimpses of a landscape through architectural openings. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting an indoor setting with views to the outside.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a devotional image related to Christ's Passion or the wounds of Christ, possibly within a context of prayer or contemplation. The man holding the sword could represent a figure of authority or a devotee engaging with the sacred image.",
