    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an ornate architectural setting. A priest, adorned in a red chasuble with gold embellishments and a blue shield bearing a crest, stands on a raised wooden platform, holding a white host aloft. He is surrounded by a congregation of four individuals, two kneeling and two standing, all with their hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a patterned wall of blue and gold diamonds is visible, framed by pink architectural elements and white columns. An altar is present, featuring an open book, a chalice, and a crucifix. The overall impression is one of solemn devotion and liturgical observance.",
