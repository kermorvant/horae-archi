    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a nude woman with long, flowing red hair bathing in a body of water. She wears a pearl necklace and a bracelet. In the background, a king wearing a crown and a blue mantle, accompanied by another figure, leans out of an arched window of a multi-story building. Behind this structure, a larger, more complex building with arched windows and a red-tiled roof is visible, set against a landscape of rolling hills and trees under a blue sky with clouds. The overall scene is framed by ornate golden architectural elements.",
