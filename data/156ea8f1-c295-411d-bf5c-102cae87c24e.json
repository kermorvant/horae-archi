    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, crowned and holding a book, standing to the left and facing Elizabeth. An angel, with large wings and a halo, stands between them, gesturing towards Elizabeth. Elizabeth, an older woman with a head covering, is shown holding a baby, while another child stands beside her. The figures are set against a red, patterned background within a decorative frame. The overall composition suggests a religious narrative, likely the meeting of Mary and Elizabeth after the Annunciation, a pivotal moment in Christian theology.",
