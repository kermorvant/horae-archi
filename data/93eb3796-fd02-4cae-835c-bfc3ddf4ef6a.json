    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a beard and a cap is depicted in profile, looking upwards and to the right. He is wearing a tunic with decorative buttons and a belt. His left arm is bent, and his index finger is raised, suggesting he is speaking or making a point. The background is filled with a dotted pattern, and the scene is framed by architectural elements that suggest an interior space. The figure's gesture and contemplative gaze might allude to a prophet or a wise figure engaged in contemplation or discourse.",
