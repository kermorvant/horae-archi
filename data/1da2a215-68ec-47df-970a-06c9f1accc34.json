    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a profile view of a woman with long, flowing hair, wearing a garment with a fur collar. Her hands are clasped in front of her. The scene is framed by decorative borders, suggesting it is an illustration within a manuscript. The style is reminiscent of early woodcuts or engravings, with bold outlines and hatching for shading. No specific architectural elements or setting are clearly visible beyond the decorative framing.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a devotional figure, possibly a saint or a noblewoman, within the context of a Book of Hours. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific scene interpretation is not possible. However, the posture of clasped hands often signifies prayer or contemplation.",
