    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Catherine of Alexandria, identifiable by her halo, palm frond of martyrdom, and the book she holds. She is dressed in a royal blue gown adorned with fleur-de-lis and a red mantle lined with ermine. Her head is crowned, and a golden halo surrounds her. To her left, a broken wheel, a symbol of her martyrdom, lies on the ground next to a sleeping figure wearing a crown, likely representing Emperor Maxentius. The background is a verdant landscape with rolling hills and distant trees, under a blue sky with a radiant sun. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
