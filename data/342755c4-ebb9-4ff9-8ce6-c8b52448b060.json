    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two shepherds in a pastoral landscape. One shepherd, standing and wearing an orange robe and blue hood, leans on a staff and looks upwards. The other shepherd, kneeling and dressed in blue, plays a bagpipe. A flock of sheep and a dog are gathered around them. In the background, a stylized, rocky hill dominates the landscape, with a distant village and rolling hills under a cloudy sky. The overall impression is one of rural life and possibly a religious or devotional moment, perhaps related to the Annunciation to the Shepherds.",
