    "scene_description_enriched": "Four women are depicted in close proximity, their faces turned towards each other in conversation or contemplation. The woman on the far left wears a headdress that frames her face and a belted garment. The two central women are also veiled, with one touching the other's arm. The woman on the far right is also veiled and appears to be gesturing with her hands, which are clasped together. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching to suggest form and drapery. No architectural elements or specific setting are visible, suggesting a focus on the figures and their interaction.",
