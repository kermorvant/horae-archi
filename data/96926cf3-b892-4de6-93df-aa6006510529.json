    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned woman, adorned with a necklace, sits on the left, with a serpent coiled around her. Before her is a multi-headed creature, possibly a hydra, with several animalistic heads. She extends her hand towards a man wearing a helmet or elaborate headdress, who is holding a vessel. To the right, a group of men, some bearded and others with caps, observe the scene. The overall composition suggests a symbolic or allegorical representation rather than a literal event.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely an allegory or a depiction from a non-biblical text, possibly representing vice or a pagan deity being overcome or confronted. The crowned woman with the serpent could symbolize a powerful, perhaps negative, entity, while the multi-headed creature might represent chaos or multiple sins. The men observing could be witnesses or figures representing humanity.",
