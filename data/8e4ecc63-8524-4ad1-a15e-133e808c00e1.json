    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identifiable by his halo and the eagle, his traditional symbol, which is shown carrying a small inkwell in its beak. The saint is kneeling on a rocky outcrop beside a body of water, holding a quill and a scroll, seemingly in the act of writing or dictating. He is dressed in a white tunic and a reddish-orange cloak. In the background, a winding path leads up to a fortified castle on a hill, with another smaller building visible in the distance. The sky is a bright blue, with rays of sunlight emanating from the upper right corner. The overall setting is a landscape with trees and rolling hills, suggesting an outdoor environment.",
