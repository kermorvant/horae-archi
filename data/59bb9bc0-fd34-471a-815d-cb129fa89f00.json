    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross, his body pale and draped in a white loincloth. A wound is visible on his side, and blood drips from his feet. To the right of Christ, the Christ Child, also with a halo, reaches out towards him. The background is a richly patterned mosaic of gold, blue, and red squares, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting. The base of the cross rests on a rocky outcrop, with sparse green foliage at the bottom of the image.",
