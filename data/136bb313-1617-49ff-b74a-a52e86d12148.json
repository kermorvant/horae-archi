He is bathed in a golden light emanating from above, surrounded by a multitude of winged cherubs and fiery seraphim against a blue, cloudy sky. Below, two angels flank a royal coat of arms featuring three fleur-de-lis on a blue shield, surmounted by a crown. Banners with Latin inscriptions surround the coat of arms, including \"REGIS MATRIS & SORORIS\" and \"TER MARIVM NOBILE VNVE EST DESIDERIVM\". The lower portion of the image shows a green, grassy landscape.",
