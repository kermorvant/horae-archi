    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a circular frame. On the left, a man with a beard and short hair, wearing a tunic, is shown with his hands clasped in prayer or supplication. He is positioned beneath a stylized tree with bare branches. On the right, a bearded figure with long hair, possibly an elder or prophet, stands with his arms outstretched, palms facing upwards, in a gesture of speaking or blessing. He is depicted with a halo or radiating light around his head. The background is filled with a dense pattern of dots, suggesting a starry sky or a divine presence. The overall composition evokes a spiritual encounter or a moment of divine revelation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of divine communication or prophecy, possibly depicting a prophet receiving a vision or a divine message. The figure on the right with the halo and outstretched arms could represent God or a divine messenger, while the figure on the left represents a mortal receiving the message. The barren tree might symbolize a spiritual barrenness or a place of spiritual significance. Without further context, a specific biblical event is difficult to pinpoint, but it aligns with themes of prophecy and divine revelation common in religious art.",
