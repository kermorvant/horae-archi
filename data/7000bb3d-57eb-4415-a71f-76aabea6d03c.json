    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable structure. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies swaddled on a blue cloth in a manger. To the right, Saint Joseph kneels, holding a circular object and a staff, his gaze directed towards the infant. The stable is constructed of wooden beams and has a thatched roof. Behind the figures, a woven wattle fence is visible, and beyond that, a green landscape under a blue sky. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with foliate motifs.",
