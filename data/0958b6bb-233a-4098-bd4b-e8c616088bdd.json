    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel kneeling before the Virgin Mary, who is seated on a throne. The angel, with large white wings and a pink robe, holds a scroll with the inscription \"Ave gratia plena Dominus tecum.\" The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe and golden halo, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, looking towards the angel. Above them, a divine light emanates from a golden background filled with stars. In the lower right corner, a bearded man in a red robe and green head covering is depicted, also holding a scroll. The architectural setting is suggested by ornate columns, arches, and decorative elements, creating a sense of a sacred, possibly heavenly, space. The floor is tiled with a black and white geometric pattern.",
