    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a memento mori, a skull rendered in a realistic, albeit stylized, manner. The skull is depicted within a circular frame, bordered by a pink ribbon and set against a blue background. Inscriptions are visible on the forehead and within the eye sockets of the skull. The lower portion of the skull rests on a green, undulating landscape, suggesting it is placed outdoors or on the earth. The overall composition is framed by decorative elements, including gold leaf and blue and pink flourishes, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
