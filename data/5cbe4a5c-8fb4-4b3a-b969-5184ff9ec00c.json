    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king seated on a throne, holding a sword and gesturing with his other hand. He wears a blue robe adorned with gold patterns and a green, leafy crown. Around him are several figures, including a knight in golden armor to his left, and other individuals in blue robes and caps. In the foreground, a naked infant lies on the floor. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the presence of a doorway or archway and the implied enclosure.",
