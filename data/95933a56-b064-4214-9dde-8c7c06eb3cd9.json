    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a representation of a saint or a symbolic figure, stands holding a miniature architectural structure resembling a crib or a small building with a railing. The figure wears a jeweled headdress and ornate clothing, including a belt with a floral clasp. The background is filled with stars, suggesting a celestial or symbolic setting. The figure's left hand points towards the viewer, while the right hand supports the architectural model. The overall style is that of a woodcut illustration, common in medieval manuscripts.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a saint or a symbolic figure associated with a specific devotional practice or a biblical event. The architectural model could symbolize a church, a heavenly Jerusalem, or a place of worship. The stars in the background reinforce a celestial or spiritual context. Without further iconographic clues, a precise interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of faith, devotion, and perhaps the founding or protection of a religious institution.",
