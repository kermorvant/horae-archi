    "scene_description_enriched": "Two winged figures, possibly putti or angels, are depicted holding a coat of arms. The figure on the left has its wings spread, while the figure on the right has its wings folded. Both figures are nude and appear to be supporting a large banner that encircles a shield. The shield is divided into sections, with one side featuring a zig-zag pattern and the other side showing horizontal stripes. The banner itself contains inscriptions, with \"VALLANT\" visible on the top curve and \"RIENS IMPOSIBLE\" on the bottom curve. The figures stand on a tiled surface, and the background is dark and indistinct, suggesting an outdoor or perhaps a stylized setting. The overall composition is heraldic and devotional, likely representing a family crest or a symbolic representation of divine power.",
