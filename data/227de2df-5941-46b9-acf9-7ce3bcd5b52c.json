    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, holds the Christ Child on her lap. Behind her, Saint Joseph stands with a staff. Three Magi, identified by their crowns and rich attire, approach the Virgin and Child. The first Magus, kneeling, offers a golden chalice. The second Magus, in green, holds a similar vessel, and the third, in blue, carries a golden dish. They are accompanied by a retinue of figures in the background. The setting appears to be a humble dwelling, suggested by the draped red fabric and the dark, tiled roof of a simple structure visible behind the figures. A star shines in the blue sky above.",
