    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men engaged in conversation or debate, possibly within an architectural setting suggested by an arched structure overhead adorned with decorative elements. The central figure on the right, with a long beard and wearing a hat, gestures with his hands, while other figures, some in armor or elaborate clothing, are positioned around him. The style is illustrative and appears to be a woodcut or engraving from a medieval manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a specific, readily identifiable biblical or devotional event. It appears to be a secular or historical scene, possibly illustrating a council, a legal proceeding, or a philosophical discussion among notable figures.",
