    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two shepherds and a flock of sheep in a pastoral landscape. One shepherd, on the left, plays a bagpipe, looking upwards with a pensive expression. The other shepherd, on the right, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, also gazing upwards. Above them, a blue angel descends from a golden halo, holding a scroll inscribed with \"GLORIA IN ALTIS\". In the background, rolling green hills are dotted with trees and a winding river, leading to a distant castle on a hilltop. The overall scene evokes a sense of divine revelation in a humble, rural setting.",
