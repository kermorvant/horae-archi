    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, depicted in profile, wears a richly decorated tunic with circular motifs and a headdress. He is gesturing with his right hand, holding a staff or scepter, while his left hand is raised towards his face. The background features architectural elements, including what appears to be a column and decorative tracery, suggesting an indoor or perhaps a stylized architectural setting. The overall style is that of a woodcut or engraving, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a biblical or historical figure, possibly a king or prophet, given the regal attire and gesture of contemplation or pronouncement. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific scene interpretation is not possible, but it evokes themes of authority, wisdom, or prophecy.",
