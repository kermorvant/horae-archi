    "scene_description_enriched": "In a bustling urban setting depicted with numerous towers and buildings, a man in a red tunic and white apron wields a large mallet, poised to strike a boar. Beside him, a woman in a blue gown and white apron holds a ladle over a pot, seemingly preparing to cook or process the animal. The scene unfolds outdoors with a green wall separating the foreground activity from the cityscape in the background. This depiction likely represents a scene of daily life, possibly related to butchery or food preparation within a medieval town.",
