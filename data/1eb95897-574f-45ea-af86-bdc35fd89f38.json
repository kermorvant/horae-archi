The Holy Spirit is represented by a dove descending from above. God the Father is seated on a throne-like structure, draped in a red and gold robe, with a blue mantle. The background is filled with golden rays emanating from behind the figures, and swirling blue clouds. The crucified Christ is shown with wounds and a loincloth, his arms outstretched on the cross.",
