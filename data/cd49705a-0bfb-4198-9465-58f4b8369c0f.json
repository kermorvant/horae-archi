    "scene_description_enriched": "Two women, identified as the Virgin Mary and Saint Elizabeth by their halos and devotional context, clasp hands in a tender gesture. The Virgin Mary, on the left, wears a blue mantle over a dark blue dress. Saint Elizabeth, on the right, is depicted with a golden-orange veil over a blue dress, and a red mantle. They are positioned in a lush, green landscape with rolling hills, trees, and large rocks. In the background, a castle with towers and crenellations is visible on a rocky outcrop. Rays of golden light descend from the upper left, suggesting divine presence or blessing. The scene evokes a sense of quiet intimacy and spiritual connection.",
