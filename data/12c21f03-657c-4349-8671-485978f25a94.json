    "scene_description_enriched": "A small, brown bird with a slightly open beak is perched on a thin branch. The bird is depicted in profile, facing left. Behind the bird, stylized green foliage emerges from a blue background. The entire scene is enclosed within a circular frame decorated with colorful, jewel-like ornaments and gold filigree. This image likely represents a naturalistic detail or a symbolic element within a larger devotional context, possibly related to the beauty of creation or a specific allegorical meaning associated with birds in medieval art.",
