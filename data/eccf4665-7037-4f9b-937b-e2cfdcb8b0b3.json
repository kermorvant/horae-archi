    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a richly decorated architectural setting, likely a church interior, suggested by the Gothic tracery and pinnacles. On the left, a woman in a blue robe, crowned and with a halo, kneels with her arms crossed over her chest. On the right, a figure, possibly Christ, also with a halo, is seated and holds a globe in his left hand, while gesturing with his right. The background features elaborate, vertical architectural elements resembling a screen or reredos, with niches containing figures, and a central blue panel with celestial imagery. The overall impression is one of solemnity and divine encounter.",
