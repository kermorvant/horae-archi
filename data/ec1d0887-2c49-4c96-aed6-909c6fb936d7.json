    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel kneeling on the left, holding a golden staff and extending his left arm upwards. He is dressed in a white robe and has large golden wings. He is addressing the Virgin Mary, who is kneeling on the right, her arms crossed over her chest, wearing a golden dress and a blue mantle. A book lies open on a red cushion before her. Behind Mary, a red curtain hangs from a canopy. In the background, a landscape with hills, trees, and buildings is visible under a blue sky. Rays of golden light descend from a divine figure at the top left, illuminating the scene and a dove representing the Holy Spirit.",
