    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, identified as a bishop by his mitre and crozier, stands in a verdant landscape. He is clad in a white alb, a green chasuble, and an orange cope adorned with blue trim and gold embroidery. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing, while his left hand holds a golden crozier. The background features a decorative pattern of gold motifs on a red ground, suggesting a stylized, perhaps heavenly, setting. The lower portion of the image depicts a green grassy area with stylized yellow plants.",
