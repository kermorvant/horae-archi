She is adorned in a blue mantle over a purple garment, both trimmed with gold. The angels, with vibrantly colored wings (green, purple, red, and white), are positioned around her, some reaching towards her. The background is a radiant gold, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting, with clouds depicted at the bottom. The overall composition evokes a sense of celestial reverence and the Assumption or Coronation of the Virgin.",
