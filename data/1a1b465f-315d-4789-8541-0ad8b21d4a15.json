    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable, indicated by the thatched roof and wooden structure. The Virgin Mary, in a blue and gold robe, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies on a blue cloth radiating golden light. To the right, Saint Joseph, dressed in a golden robe and blue mantle, kneels and holds a lit candle, his gaze directed downwards. Two angels, one in white and the other in red, stand behind them, with hands clasped in prayer. In the background, a dark, silhouetted donkey is visible within the stable. Beyond the stable, architectural elements of a city or castle are depicted, with stone walls and towers under a blue sky dotted with golden stars. The overall scene is framed by an ornate, gilded border with foliate motifs.",
