    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family in an outdoor setting. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, sits on the ground, holding a sprig of greenery. Beside her stands the Christ Child, also in a blue robe, looking upwards and holding a similar sprig. In the background, a man in a red tunic and blue hose is reaching up to pick fruit from a tree. A donkey is visible to the right of the figures. The landscape is rendered with rolling green hills and a blue sky, suggesting a pastoral environment. The presence of the fruit-picking man and the donkey, along with the Virgin and Child, evokes the Flight into Egypt, where the family sought refuge and sustenance.",
