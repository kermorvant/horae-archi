    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint or holy person, is depicted seated and engrossed in reading a manuscript. The figure wears a dark cloak over a striped garment and a white wimple and cap. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the presence of architectural elements such as columns and arches, and a draped curtain behind the figure. To the right, an arched opening reveals a distant landscape with buildings. The overall impression is one of scholarly contemplation or religious devotion.",
