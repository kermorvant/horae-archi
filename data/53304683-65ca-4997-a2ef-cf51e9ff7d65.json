    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a crowned female figure standing in a grassy landscape. She wears a golden crown, a red cloak over a white garment adorned with black dots, and a blue undergarment. In her left hand, she holds a golden object shaped like a crescent moon with three white elements attached, possibly representing a torture instrument. Her right hand rests on the hilt of a sword. In the background, there are trees and distant buildings with spires. Rays of light emanate from the upper left corner, suggesting a divine presence or blessing. The figure's attributes, the crown, sword, and crescent, are indicative of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a martyr often depicted with these symbols.",
