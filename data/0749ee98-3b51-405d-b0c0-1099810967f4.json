    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male saint, identified by a halo, stands holding a book in his left arm and a sword in his right hand. He is dressed in a red tunic and a blue mantle lined with green. The scene is framed by architectural elements, suggesting an interior space looking out onto a landscape. The floor is tiled in a pink and white checkerboard pattern. The background depicts a green landscape with trees and a large rock formation under a blue sky. The saint's posture and attributes suggest he is a martyr, possibly Saint Paul, given the sword.",
