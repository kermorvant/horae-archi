    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. The Angel Gabriel, adorned in a red and gold robe, kneels and points towards the Virgin Mary, who is also kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer. A book lies open on a green cloth between them. Above, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light towards Mary. The background features architectural elements, including what appears to be a niche with a sculpted figure, and a canopy draped in red fabric over Mary. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern.",
