    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned man, seated on a throne-like chair, is depicted in profile, engaged in hammering. He holds two hammers, one raised above his head and another in his right hand, striking an object. Several anvil-like forms are visible in front of him, arranged in a line, suggesting a workshop or construction setting. The background is a textured gold, typical of manuscript illumination, with decorative elements framing the scene. The figure wears a pink robe and orange hose. The scene likely represents King David, known for his wisdom and association with building projects, possibly the Temple of Jerusalem, or a more general depiction of a craftsman at work.",
