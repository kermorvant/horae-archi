    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, likely King David, kneels in prayer with his hands outstretched towards a divine light emanating from the upper right. He is dressed in a rich blue robe adorned with gold fleur-de-lis. Before him lie a golden crown and a harp, symbols of his kingship and musical talent. The background depicts a dramatic landscape with towering, jagged mountains on the left, a dark, rocky formation in the center, and a large green, amorphous shape on the right, possibly representing a monstrous entity or a symbolic landscape. Rays of sunlight descend from a golden sun disc in the upper left, illuminating the scene and suggesting divine intervention or presence. The overall composition suggests a moment of spiritual crisis or divine revelation.",
