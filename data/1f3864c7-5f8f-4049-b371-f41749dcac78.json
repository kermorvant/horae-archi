    "scene_description_enriched": "A young man, wearing a white tunic and a red turban, sits within a large wooden barrel. His legs are visible, clad in patterned undergarments. He reaches out his hands. To his right, a figure in a red tunic and green hose, wearing a white headdress that resembles a veil or hood, also extends their hands towards the young man. The background depicts an interior architectural setting with a patterned wall and what appears to be a decorative frieze or tapestry. The scene likely depicts a moment of intervention or rescue, possibly related to a biblical narrative or a saint's legend, where a figure is being pulled from or placed into a container.",
