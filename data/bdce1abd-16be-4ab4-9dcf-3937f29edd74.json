    "scene_description_enriched": "A small, vibrantly colored bird, predominantly blue and orange with black accents on its wings and tail, is depicted within a diamond-shaped frame. The bird is shown in profile, facing left, with its head turned slightly upwards. The background within the frame is a pale yellow, and the frame itself is outlined in gold. The surrounding decorative border is a reddish-pink with intricate gold patterns. No architectural elements or human figures are present.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of a bird, especially a small, colorful one, in medieval manuscript illumination often carries symbolic meaning. Birds can represent the soul, divine messages, or the fleeting nature of life. In devotional contexts, they might symbolize freedom, hope, or the Holy Spirit. Without further context from the manuscript, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it likely serves as a decorative element with potential symbolic resonance.",
