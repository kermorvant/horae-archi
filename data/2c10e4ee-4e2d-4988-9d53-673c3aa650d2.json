    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A woman in a blue robe and white veil kneels before a stone pedestal, her hands outstretched. On the pedestal lies a swaddled infant, held by a bearded man in a gold and blue robe. Behind them, several figures are gathered: a man in a purple robe and red hat, a woman in a green robe holding a staff, another woman in a red robe, and a man in a purple robe holding a basket containing birds. The background features architectural elements, including a large window with tracery and a golden, ornate canopy above. The overall setting suggests an interior space within a religious building.",
