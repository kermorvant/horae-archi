    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures, one wearing a black hat and green tunic, the other a hooded yellow garment and red tunic, are in a wooden boat on wavy blue water. They are actively engaged in fishing, pulling a net filled with fish from the water. The scene is framed by decorative elements, including a stylized plant with brown leaves and blue and red foliate motifs at the top. This imagery likely alludes to the biblical account of the miraculous catch of fish, a common theme associated with the disciples of Christ.",
