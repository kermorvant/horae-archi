    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. Christ's body, marked with wounds and wearing a crown of thorns, is held by the Virgin Mary. Another woman, likely Mary Magdalene, supports his head. A fourth figure, possibly another mourner, stands to the right. The figures are rendered with somber expressions, conveying grief. The background is a simple, stylized landscape with a blue sky. The overall composition is intimate and emotionally charged, focusing on the sorrow of the mourners and the suffering of Christ.",
