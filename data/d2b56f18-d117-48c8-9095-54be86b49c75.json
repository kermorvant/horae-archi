    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, cloaked in a vibrant blue mantle, riding on a donkey. Beside her walks a man, possibly Saint Joseph, wearing a pink robe and a dark hat. They are traveling along a path through a green, grassy landscape dotted with trees. In the background, a stylized monument with a figure suspended from it stands against a pale blue sky, with a distant city skyline visible. The overall impression is one of a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or the Nativity, given the figures and the presence of a donkey.",
