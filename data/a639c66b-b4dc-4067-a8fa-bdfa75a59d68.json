    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated male figure, identified as Christ by his halo, writing on a scroll or manuscript. He is dressed in a red tunic and a blue mantle. To his left, kneeling, is a winged figure, likely an angel, wearing a red cloak over a white garment. The angel holds a dark object, possibly an inkwell, and looks towards Christ. The background features architectural elements, including a pink wall with two diamond-paned windows, and a blue vaulted structure with similar windows. A green patterned tapestry or wall covering is visible behind Christ. The floor is tiled with a green and black checkered pattern. The overall setting suggests an interior space, possibly a study or a room within a religious building, where sacred texts are being produced or dictated.",
