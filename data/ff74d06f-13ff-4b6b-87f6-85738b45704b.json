A man in a blue tunic and pink hose stands on a ladder, supporting Christ's body. Another man, also in a blue tunic and with a halo, reaches up to assist. To the left, three figures, two with halos and dressed in blue and pink robes, observe the scene. A man in an orange tunic and blue hose stands below, holding a hammer and chisel, seemingly having just removed nails from the cross.",
