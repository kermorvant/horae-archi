Christ is shown reaching out to the kneeling figure, who is clad in a simple white garment. Behind them, a group of men in varied attire, including one in a distinctive blue and red robe with a blue hat, observe the interaction. The background features a townscape with buildings, including a church with a blue tiled roof and a dome, and a fortified wall. The overall setting suggests an outdoor urban environment where a miraculous healing is taking place.",
