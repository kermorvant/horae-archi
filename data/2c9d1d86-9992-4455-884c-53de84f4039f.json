    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an interior space with an arched opening revealing an outdoor landscape. In the foreground, a young man in armor kneels before a seated king. The king, adorned in a blue robe and a white crown, gestures with his right hand. Behind the king, several figures stand, some wearing elaborate hats. The kneeling figure holds a staff. The outdoor scene visible through the arch shows two figures engaged in an activity, possibly hunting or farming, with a distant castle-like structure on a hill. The architectural elements suggest a royal or noble setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a moment from the Old Testament, possibly David before King Saul, or a similar narrative of a supplicant or messenger addressing royalty. The presence of a king and a kneeling figure suggests a scene of petition, judgment, or audience.",
