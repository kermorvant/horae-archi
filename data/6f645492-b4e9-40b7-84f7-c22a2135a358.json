    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Francis kneeling in prayer outdoors, with a halo around his head. He is wearing a brown Franciscan habit and his hands and feet show stigmata, indicated by red marks. He gazes upwards towards a celestial vision of a winged, angelic figure with a crown, emanating from a red, flower-like form. Red threads connect the figure to Saint Francis's hands and feet. To the left, a small, grey building with a pointed roof and a circular window is visible, with another robed figure seated in front of it. A path leads towards the building. In the background, a lush green forest borders a body of water and distant mountains under a blue sky. A blue book with gold embellishments lies open on the ground near Saint Francis.",
