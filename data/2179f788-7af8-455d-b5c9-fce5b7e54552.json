    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic and dramatic event, possibly a judgment or a battle against monstrous forces. A central figure, a bearded man with a trident-like staff, rides a beast resembling a bull or a centaur, trampling over fallen figures. To the left, several individuals are shown in distress, with one figure raising their hands in supplication or despair. Above, clouds suggest a celestial or atmospheric setting. The overall impression is one of conflict and divine intervention or wrath.",
