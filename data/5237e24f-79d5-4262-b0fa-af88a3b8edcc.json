    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and cope, stands on a patterned floor, radiating divine light. He is depicted in the act of blessing or interceding for two nude figures, likely children, who are submerged in a large tub or vat. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element and decorative foliage borders, suggesting a sacred or devotional context. The bishop's gesture and the presence of the children in the tub are indicative of a miracle or a saintly intervention.",
