    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a trial or judgment. On the left, Jesus, wearing a purple robe and a crown of thorns, is presented by two guards. He has wounds on his forehead and is barefoot. To the right, a king, adorned in a blue robe with gold floral patterns and a distinctive green and white hat, sits on a throne. He is gesturing with his hand towards a man kneeling before him, offering a shallow dish. Behind the king, two figures in green and blue robes observe the proceedings. The setting appears to be an interior space with a richly decorated throne and a dark green background, suggesting a formal court.",
