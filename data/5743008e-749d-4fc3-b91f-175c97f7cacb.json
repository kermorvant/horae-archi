    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, possibly a prophet or patriarch, is depicted seated on a throne-like structure. He wears a blue robe, a distinctive hat with a radiating halo, and holds a staff in his left hand and a red book in his right. The background is a rich tapestry of gold and blue squares, with a decorative border framing the scene. The throne appears to be made of pink and red blocks, suggesting a built structure. The overall impression is one of solemnity and authority, likely representing a figure of religious significance.",
