    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a domestic interior, likely a bedroom, where a woman lies in a bed, appearing to be recovering from childbirth. She is attended by several women. One woman, dressed in green, is bathing a baby in a basin. Another woman, in a gold dress, stands by the bed, while a third woman, in a mustard-colored tunic, looks on. A table with a candlestick and a blue vase is visible near the bed. The overall impression is one of care and domesticity following a birth.",
