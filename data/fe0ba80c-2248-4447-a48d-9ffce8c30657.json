    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, cradles the lifeless body of Christ, whose wounds are visible. To the left, a figure, likely John the Evangelist, gazes at Christ with sorrow, his hands clasped. Behind them, a stylized city with towers and spires is depicted, set against a backdrop of rolling hills and a blue sky. A large golden cross dominates the upper portion of the image, with a small inscription at its apex. The foreground is a green landscape with sparse vegetation.",
