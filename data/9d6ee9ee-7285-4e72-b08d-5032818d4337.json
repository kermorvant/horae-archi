    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral procession or a vigil for the deceased. On the left, three figures in clerical robes, likely priests or monks, stand facing right. They wear black outer robes lined with gold and white undergarments. In the center, a fourth figure, also in clerical attire, gestures towards the right. On the right, a group of figures cloaked in black, with hoods obscuring their faces, stand in solemn attendance. In the foreground, a white shroud, presumably covering a body, lies on the ground. Behind the figures, a grand architectural structure with a large arched portal, adorned with gold detailing and topped with a cross, suggests a church or chapel entrance. The background shows a glimpse of trees and a blue sky, indicating an outdoor setting adjacent to the building.",
