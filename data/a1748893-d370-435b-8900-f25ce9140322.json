    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic maritime event with several figures struggling in turbulent waters. On the left, a bearded man with long hair is partially submerged, his arms raised. To his right, a woman with long hair and bare breasts is also in the water, her hands outstretched. Several fish-like creatures, some with sharp teeth, are visible in the waves, appearing to menace the figures. The overall impression is one of distress and danger at sea.",
