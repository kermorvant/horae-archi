    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the body of Christ, marked by wounds and a halo, being held by the Virgin Mary, who is dressed in a blue mantle and also has a halo. To the left, a bearded man in a blue robe and white turban, likely Joseph of Arimathea, supports Christ's head. To the right, a woman in a red and green garment, possibly Mary Magdalene, looks on with sorrow. Another figure, a man in a dark robe and white headdress, is partially visible on the far right. A kneeling figure in a red robe, with a halo, reaches up towards Christ's hand. The figures are positioned around a stone sarcophagus or bier. The background features a stylized landscape with rolling green hills, trees, and distant blue architectural forms suggesting a city or mountainous terrain. The overall composition conveys a somber and devotional atmosphere.",
