    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King David kneeling in prayer outdoors, looking upwards towards a divine vision. He is richly robed in blue and red, with a fur-lined mantle. Before him lies a harp, partially covered by a cloth, and a crown. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible, along with rolling hills and trees. Above, a divine apparition shows God the Father, crowned and holding a book, flanked by two angels. An angel with a sword stands atop a blue-domed building in the middle ground, seemingly overseeing the scene. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine revelation or intercession.",
