    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Matthew seated on a tiered structure, possibly a bench or a low altar, with his legs crossed and bare feet visible. He is dressed in flowing robes and has a halo, indicating his saintly status. Before him is a lectern supporting an open book with text that reads ': geandium matheum'. His left hand rests on the book, while his right hand is extended upwards. To the right, an angel, also with a halo, descends from a dark, leafy background, reaching towards Saint Matthew. The angel appears to be in the act of inspiration or dictation, suggesting the divine origin of Matthew's Gospel.",
