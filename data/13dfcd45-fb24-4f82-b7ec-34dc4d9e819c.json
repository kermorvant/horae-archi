    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a fantastical landscape with a large, reptilian creature with multiple legs and a long, segmented tail in the foreground, set against a backdrop of rolling green hills dotted with trees. In the middle ground, a body of water is populated by several sailing ships. In the background, a majestic castle with multiple towers and spires stands on a cliff overlooking the water, with other distant structures visible on a hill. The sky is a pale blue with scattered clouds, some highlighted with gold leaf. The overall impression is one of a mythical or allegorical setting, possibly representing a journey or a confrontation with a beast.",
