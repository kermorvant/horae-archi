    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, looking down at the Christ Child lying in a golden manger. To the left, Saint Joseph, with a grey beard and wearing a monastic-like robe, also kneels in prayer. Behind them, an angel with blue wings and a pink robe stands with hands clasped. In the background, a simple wooden stable structure is visible, with a thatched roof. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling hills and stylized trees under a blue sky from which golden rays of divine light emanate.",
