    "scene_description_enriched": "In a verdant meadow dotted with sheep and a watchful dog, several shepherds look upwards in awe. One shepherd, kneeling, gestures with his hand towards the sky. Another, standing with a crook, also gazes skyward. Behind them, a river flows, and beyond that, a walled city with numerous spires and towers rises. In the bright blue sky above, a golden angel with outstretched wings descends, its gaze directed towards the shepherds. This scene depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a pivotal moment in the Nativity narrative where angels announce the birth of Christ to humble shepherds.",
