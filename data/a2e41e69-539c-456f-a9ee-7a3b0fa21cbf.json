    "scene_description_enriched": "Two women are depicted in profile, facing each other. The woman on the left wears a brown robe cinched with a blue belt and a red headdress. The woman on the right wears a red dress with blue trim and a dark veil. Her hands are clasped in prayer. The background is a vibrant blue with scattered gold dots, suggesting a celestial or divine setting, with a faint, stylized representation of foliage or drapery between the figures. The scene likely depicts the Visitation, where Mary, pregnant with Christ, visits her cousin Elizabeth, who is also pregnant.",
