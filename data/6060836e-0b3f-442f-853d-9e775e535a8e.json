    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two distinct parts. On the left, a king with a crown and a long white beard leans out of a window in a brick tower, his head resting on his hand, appearing weary or contemplative. Below the tower, a body of water flows downwards. On the right, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, kneels before a lectern, reading a book. An angel, with wings outstretched and wearing a pink robe, hovers above and to the right of Mary, extending a ray of light towards her. The interior space on the right features a red, patterned tapestry and a tiled floor. The overall composition suggests a narrative, likely depicting a biblical event.",
