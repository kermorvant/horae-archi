    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The body of Christ, pale and marked with wounds, is held by the Virgin Mary, who is draped in a blue mantle. To the left, a figure in a red cloak, likely Saint John the Evangelist, supports Christ's arm. To the right, another woman, possibly Mary Magdalene, gently touches Christ's feet. Behind them, a wooden cross is visible, suggesting the setting of the crucifixion. The figures are rendered with solemn expressions, conveying grief and sorrow. The background is a simple landscape with rolling green hills and a pale blue sky.",
