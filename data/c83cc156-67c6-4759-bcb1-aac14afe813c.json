    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an oval frame, suggesting a miniature within a manuscript. In the center, a figure in green, wearing a white headdress, is embraced by another figure in red. To the left, a figure in blue holds a book. Several other figures, all with golden halos, surround the central group. The floor is tiled with a checkerboard pattern. The overall impression is one of a religious or devotional gathering, possibly representing a biblical event or a saintly encounter.",
