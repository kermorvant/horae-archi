    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude figure, possibly a woman, is depicted in a seated or reclining position, with her legs bent and her arms reaching out. She is positioned behind a textured surface that resembles a bed or a pile of fabric. To her left, foliage with large leaves and clusters of berries or grapes is visible. The background is filled with a dense pattern of small circles, suggesting a textured or natural setting. The overall composition is framed by a decorative border with geometric patterns.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely an allegorical representation or a depiction from classical mythology, rather than a biblical or devotional scene typically found in Books of Hours. The nudity and the surrounding foliage might allude to themes of nature, fertility, or perhaps a specific mythological figure. Without further context or clearer iconographic elements, a precise interpretation is difficult.",
