    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures are depicted in a naturalistic setting, possibly a garden or forest, suggested by the foliage and the presence of what appear to be animals or mythical creatures at the bottom. The central figure, wearing a cap, stands slightly forward and to the left, engaged in conversation with the figure to his right. The figure on the right, also in conversation, gestures with their hands. A third figure is partially visible behind the central figure, wearing a hood. The scene is framed by an arched element at the top, possibly representing a natural archway or architectural canopy, and the overall impression is one of a narrative scene unfolding outdoors.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a readily identifiable biblical, liturgical, or devotional event. It appears to be a genre scene or a narrative illustration from a secular text or a less common devotional theme.",
