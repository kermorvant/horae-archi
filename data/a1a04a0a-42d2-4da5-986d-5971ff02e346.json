    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, draped in a purple robe, carrying the cross. He is being assisted by a figure in a red tunic and helmet, who appears to be a soldier or guard, holding a whip or rod. Another figure, possibly Simon of Cyrene, is shown struggling to help carry the cross, his face contorted in effort. The background is a stylized landscape with hints of blue and green, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall composition emphasizes the burden and suffering of Christ.",
