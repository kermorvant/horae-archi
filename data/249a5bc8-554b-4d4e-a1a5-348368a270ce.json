    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a rocky, outdoor setting with a shepherd, identifiable by his staff and sheep, looking upwards with his hand raised. To the left, three figures are shown: a woman with a floral headdress, another woman with clasped hands, and a child partially obscured. Above them, a winged, blue angelic figure hovers in a golden sky. The overall composition suggests a divine revelation or visitation occurring in a pastoral landscape.",
