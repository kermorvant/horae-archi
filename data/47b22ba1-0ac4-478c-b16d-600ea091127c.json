    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with wings and a halo, kneels and presents a scroll to the Virgin Mary on the right. The scroll bears the inscription \"Ave Maria, plena gratia\". The Virgin Mary, also with a halo, stands with her hands raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance, holding an open book. Above and to the left, a bearded figure, likely God the Father or a prophet, is depicted in prayer. The background is filled with ornate, swirling foliage, suggesting a decorative rather than a specific architectural setting.",
