The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle over a pinkish garment, cradles the infant. The Christ Child is depicted as a small, nude figure. To the left, a woman in a red robe over a yellow tunic holds a small object, possibly a flower or fruit. To the right, another woman in a red robe stands, with the inscription \"SAL MAR\" visible on her garment. The figures are set against a backdrop of a red curtain and wooden panels, suggesting an interior space. Green foliage is visible at the bottom, hinting at an outdoor element or a decorative border.",
