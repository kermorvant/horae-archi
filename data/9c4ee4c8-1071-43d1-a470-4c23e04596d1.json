    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher wading through water, carrying the Christ Child on his shoulders. Saint Christopher, a large, bearded man, is dressed in a blue tunic and red cloak, holding a tall staff. The Christ Child, depicted as a young boy with a halo, sits on his shoulders, holding a globe and raising one hand in blessing. To the left, an older man with a beard, possibly a hermit or a traveler, is partially visible, looking towards Saint Christopher. The background shows a blue sky and a distant, indistinct landscape with a building. The overall impression is one of a perilous journey across water, guided by faith.",
