    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, likely a scribe or scholar, is depicted seated on a red cushion, engrossed in writing. He wears a purple robe over a green tunic and has bare feet. He holds an open book in his lap and is actively writing in it with a quill. Before him, on a stand, is another text, possibly a lectern, also with script. The scene is framed within an ornate, blue, and pink border with gold accents, suggesting it is an initial from a manuscript. The overall impression is one of scholarly devotion and the act of recording sacred texts.",
