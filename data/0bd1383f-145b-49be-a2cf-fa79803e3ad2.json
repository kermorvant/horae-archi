    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and bearing a large wooden cross on his shoulder, walking through a green landscape. He is dressed in a blue robe and is surrounded by a group of figures. To his left, the Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, looks down with sorrow. Behind her, other figures, some with halos, are present. To Christ's right, a soldier in red and armor pushes him forward. In the background, a fortified castle with towers and battlements is visible, suggesting the procession is moving towards or away from a city. The overall scene captures the solemnity and suffering of the Passion of Christ.",
