    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in conversation, set against a backdrop of stylized buildings. In the foreground, three individuals are prominent. The central figure, a man wearing a hat and a long robe with two buttons, holds an object in his hands. To his right, another figure, possibly a woman, gestures with her hands towards the central figure. To the left, a third figure, also in a long robe and head covering, looks away. Behind them, simplified architectural structures with windows and roofs are visible, suggesting an urban or domestic setting. The overall impression is one of social interaction within a built environment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a specific biblical or devotional event. It appears to be a genre scene illustrating everyday life or a secular narrative, possibly from a Book of Hours, but without a clear religious iconographic cue.",
