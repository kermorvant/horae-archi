    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an arched frame. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a halo, is seated and looking down, her hands clasped in prayer. She is dressed in a blue robe over an orange tunic and is positioned behind a wooden lectern displaying text. On the right, the Angel Gabriel, also with a halo and wings, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, facing the Virgin. A wavy, white line emanates from Gabriel towards Mary, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The background is a textured blue with green foliage, suggesting an outdoor setting, though the figures are framed by architectural elements.",
