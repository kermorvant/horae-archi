    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures are depicted in an outdoor setting with a background of trees and foliage. On the left, a figure in a red tunic and blue collar is seated, holding a staff. Two other figures stand before him, one in a purple tunic and the other in a yellow tunic. The figures appear to be engaged in conversation, with gestures suggesting dialogue. The scene is rendered with a flat perspective and vibrant colors typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a biblical narrative or a devotional episode. Given the presence of three figures and the pastoral setting, it could represent a moment from the life of Christ, such as the Adoration of the Shepherds, or a scene involving disciples or prophets. Without further iconographic clues, a definitive interpretation is challenging, but the interaction suggests a moment of teaching, revelation, or discussion.",
