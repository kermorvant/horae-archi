The Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue robe with gold stars, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies on a blue cloth. Saint Joseph, an elderly figure with a beard, leans on a staff, looking towards the child. A cow and a donkey are visible within the stable. Above, in a celestial realm, God the Father is depicted with a halo, flanked by two angels. In the background, a walled city with prominent towers and spires is visible, set against a rolling green landscape.",
