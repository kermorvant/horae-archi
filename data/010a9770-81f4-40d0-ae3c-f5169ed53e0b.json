    "scene_description_enriched": "The upper portion of the image depicts an astrological calendar with zodiac signs (Aquarius and Pisces) and celestial bodies, indicating the month of February. Below this, a winter landscape unfolds. In the foreground, a rustic shelter with a thatched roof houses several figures, one of whom is a woman in a blue dress. Nearby, sheep are sheltered in a woven enclosure, and crows peck at the snow. To the right, a tall, cylindrical brick structure, possibly a kiln or oven, stands beside a woman wrapped in a white cloak. In the middle ground, a man loads a donkey with bundles, while another man, dressed in blue, is engaged in an activity in a snowy wooded area. In the background, a village with a church steeple is visible amidst snow-covered hills. The scene represents the month of February, characterized by winter activities and the signs of the zodiac.",
