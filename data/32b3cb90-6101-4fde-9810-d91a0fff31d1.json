    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a distinctive bifurcated beard and a tonsure is depicted in profile, looking upwards with his hands clasped in prayer. He is richly attired in a gold robe with a pink brocade pattern, trimmed with fur and a decorative collar. Behind him, a dark curtain is visible, and to his right, a section of a wall adorned with heraldic banners featuring fleur-de-lis and crosses. Below the figure, a decorative band displays scrolls with inscriptions and a crown, suggesting a devotional or commemorative context. The overall impression is one of piety and status.",
