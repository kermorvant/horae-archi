    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded king, adorned with a golden crown and a flowing pink robe trimmed with gold, stands with his arms raised, looking upwards. To his right, a man with long, dark, unkempt hair and a beard, wearing a torn blue tunic, is chained and appears to be emerging from a stone structure. Behind him, several other figures are visible within an arched opening of the structure. Above and to the left, a haloed figure, possibly God or a prophet, is depicted in the clouds. The scene is set against a dark blue, patterned background, with a detailed stone castle-like structure dominating the right side of the image. The ground is rendered in green with some grey stone elements.",
