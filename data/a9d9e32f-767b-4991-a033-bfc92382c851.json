    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, kneels to the left, her hands extended in a gesture of reverence or welcome. To her right, Saint Joseph, also with a halo, is seated, his hands clasped in prayer and leaning on a staff. Between them, a radiant infant Christ lies in a manger, depicted with a halo and emanating light. Behind them, a thatched roof covers the stable, supported by wooden beams. In the background, a star shines brightly above a fortified building, possibly a castle or city wall, suggesting the setting is near a settlement. A figure, possibly a shepherd, is visible in the far left background.",
