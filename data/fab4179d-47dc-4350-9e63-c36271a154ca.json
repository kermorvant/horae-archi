    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, a female figure, likely representing the zodiac sign Libra, is depicted. She is dressed in a green robe and her hair is covered with a white headdress. The figure is shown in profile, leaning over a balance scale, holding a quill or stylus in her right hand and appearing to write or inscribe something. The scale has two bowls, one of which is slightly lower than the other, suggesting a state of weighing or judgment. The background within the circle is a mottled reddish-brown, and the outer border is a solid red.",
