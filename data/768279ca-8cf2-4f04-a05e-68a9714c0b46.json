    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, likely a monk or religious figure given his habit and hood, is seated at a table, holding a bowl and spoon, appearing to be eating. The table is covered with a cloth, and cutlery is visible. Behind him, a shelf holds a bottle and other items, set against a background of stippling that might represent a starry sky or a decorative pattern. The architectural setting includes what appears to be a window with tracery, suggesting an indoor, possibly monastic or domestic, environment.",
