    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated on a chair, engaged in spinning. She wears a blue robe and a white veil, with a golden halo around her head. Before her is a loom with white threads stretched taut, and she holds a spindle and a bundle of wool. To her left, a small, open chest contains various items. The background features a red tapestry with gold ornamentation and a grey stone wall with latticed windows above. The floor is a green and white checkered pattern. This scene likely represents the Virgin Mary's domestic life and her piety through the act of spinning, a common motif in devotional art.",
