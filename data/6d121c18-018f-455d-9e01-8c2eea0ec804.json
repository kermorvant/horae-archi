    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some asleep and others looking upwards in distress, are depicted in the lower part of the image. They are dressed in blue and red robes. Above them, a winged, dark creature with human-like legs descends from a starry blue sky against a richly patterned background of red, blue, and gold diamonds. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with a hint of green ground cover at the bottom. The presence of a table with a knife and a round object suggests a meal or a ritualistic setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the Fall of the Rebel Angels, where a winged figure, representing Lucifer or a demon, is cast out of heaven. The men below, possibly representing humanity or disciples, are shown in various states of reaction, perhaps witnessing this event or experiencing its spiritual consequences.",
