    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in full armor, kneeling with his hands clasped in prayer. He has a long beard and wears a helmet. Behind him, a blue cloak is draped. In the background, a group of soldiers and horses are visible approaching a fortified structure. The landscape is hilly with some trees. A harp lies on the ground in the foreground, and a red cap or crown rests on a white cloth. The text below the figure reads 'Vv Pfalm. mit. Ne reminiscaris'. This scene is interpreted as David in prayer, likely before a battle or during a time of tribulation, as indicated by the presence of soldiers and the psalm incipit 'Ne reminiscaris' (Do not remember).",
