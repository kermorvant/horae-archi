    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, a halo of golden rays emanating from his head. He is dressed in a red cloak over a blue tunic and holds a small green book in his left hand. He is walking outdoors on a path through a green landscape dotted with trees and rolling hills. In the background, a body of water is visible, with several towers and buildings suggesting a town or city. The overall impression is one of solemnity and spiritual burden.",
