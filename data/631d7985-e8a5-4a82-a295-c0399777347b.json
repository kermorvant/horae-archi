    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure in papal regalia, including a tiara and a red cope, is seated on a wooden chair, with hands clasped in prayer. A dove descends from above, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. Before the figure is an octagonal table with an open book on a lectern, two smaller books, and writing implements. To the right, a scribe in a blue robe and pink scarf sits on a wooden bench, diligently writing on a scroll. The scene is set within an interior space, suggested by a blue curtain behind the seated figure and a window with wooden shutters on the right wall. The overall atmosphere suggests a moment of divine inspiration or contemplation for the religious figure.",
