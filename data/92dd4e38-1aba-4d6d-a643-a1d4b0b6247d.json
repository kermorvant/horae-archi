    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some in monastic robes and others in secular attire, are gathered around a book held open by one of the men. The book is richly decorated with red and gold illumination. In the foreground, a woman in a pink gown sits on a stool, holding a mirror, while a man in a blue robe leans over a wooden surface, possibly a table or lectern, engaged in conversation. The background is a decorative tapestry of red, blue, and gold squares. The scene appears to depict a moment of scholarly or religious discussion and learning.",
