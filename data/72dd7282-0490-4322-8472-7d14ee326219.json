    "scene_description_enriched": "A skeletal figure, personifying Death, lunges towards a kneeling man. Death is depicted as a gaunt, emaciated skeleton with a menacing grin, wielding a club and draped in a white and pink cloth. The man, dressed in a richly decorated red and blue robe, recoils in fear, raising his hands in a gesture of supplication or defense. The scene takes place in an outdoor setting with a green grassy ground and a blue sky in the background, suggesting a moment of confrontation with mortality.",
