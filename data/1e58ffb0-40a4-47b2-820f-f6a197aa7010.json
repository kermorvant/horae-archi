    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with several figures. In the foreground, two figures are resting or praying on the ground, one with a halo. Behind them, a bearded man in an orange tunic and blue robe reclines, appearing to be asleep or contemplative. In the middle ground, a man with a halo kneels in prayer, his hands outstretched towards a wooden fence. Above him, an angel descends from clouds, holding a chalice. In the background, a city with tall buildings is visible, and to the right, a small architectural structure with figures inside. The overall scene is framed by an ornate golden arch.",
