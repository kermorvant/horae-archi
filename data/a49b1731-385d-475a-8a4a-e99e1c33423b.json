    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king kneels in prayer, his hands clasped, before a body of water with a walled city and numerous towers in the background. An angel, with large red wings and holding a sword, descends from the sky towards the king. A harp lies on the ground near the king. The scene is framed by an ornate, golden archway with decorative motifs. The overall impression is one of divine intervention or a significant spiritual moment for the king.",
