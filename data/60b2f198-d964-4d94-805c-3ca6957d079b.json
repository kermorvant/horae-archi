    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel, depicted with golden wings and a halo, descends from the sky, holding a scroll that reads \"Gloria in excelsis Deo\" (Glory to God in the highest). Below, in a pastoral landscape dotted with sheep, three shepherds are shown. One shepherd, with a long grey beard and wearing a blue robe and red hood, gestures upwards with his right hand. Another shepherd, in a red tunic and black hat, looks up with an astonished expression. A third figure, in a blue robe and green scarf, also looks upwards, shielding his eyes. In the background, a town with numerous towers and spires is visible, along with a river on which a boat sails. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
