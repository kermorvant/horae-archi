    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, identified as Christ by his halo, is seated on a gilded throne, gesturing with his right hand. He wears a red tunic and a blue mantle. Facing him, a woman, identified as the Virgin Mary by her halo and posture, kneels. She wears a blue mantle over a tan tunic and has her hands clasped. The scene takes place indoors, within a room that features architectural elements such as a window with tracery and a decorative red canopy. The floor is green and patterned. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene, likely depicting a moment of teaching or discourse between Christ and Mary.",
