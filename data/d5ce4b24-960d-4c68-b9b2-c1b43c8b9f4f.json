    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts several nude figures partially submerged in a green body of water, possibly a river or pool. Some figures are standing, others are kneeling or lying down, with their heads and torsos visible. One central figure with long hair raises her arms. The water is rendered with wavy lines, and dark horizontal elements suggest submerged objects or the edge of a bath. The background is a light blue sky, and a yellow and red border frames the composition. The scene likely represents the Baptism of Christ, with the figures being disciples or onlookers, or possibly a scene from the Old Testament or a hagiographical account involving water.",
