    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, with a halo, stands bound to a post, his body marked with wounds and blood. Two figures, one on either side, are shown striking him with scourges. A fourth figure kneels before Christ, seemingly in prayer or supplication. The background is a simple green ground and a grey wall with visible brickwork. The figures are rendered in a stylized medieval manner with gold accents on their clothing and halos.",
