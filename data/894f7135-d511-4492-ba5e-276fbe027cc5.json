    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation ceremony within a richly decorated architectural structure. A central altar-like structure, adorned with red and gold, holds the Christ Child, who is presented by the Virgin Mary. To the left, Joseph, dressed in pink, holds a basket. To the right, an elderly man in a green robe, likely Simeon, receives the child. Behind him stands a woman in blue, possibly Anna. The architectural setting features arches, columns, and a decorative roof, all set against a background of intricate gold scrollwork on a blue field. This scene likely represents the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, a significant event in the life of Jesus.",
