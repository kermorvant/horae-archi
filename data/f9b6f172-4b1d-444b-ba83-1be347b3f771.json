    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a burial or resurrection ritual taking place outdoors. Four figures are present: three in dark monastic habits, one of whom is praying with hands clasped, and another in a richly decorated blue and gold cope over a white alb, holding an open book and a small object. A fourth figure, dressed in a white monastic habit, stands holding a bucket. In the foreground, a body wrapped in a white shroud lies on the ground. Behind the figures, a brick wall is visible, with trees and foliage. A golden cross stands on a mound, and a red marker, possibly a grave marker, is also present. Rays of light emanate from a celestial source above, suggesting divine intervention or blessing. The overall scene evokes a moment of religious solemnity and spiritual significance, possibly related to the resurrection of the dead or a prayer for the departed.",
