    "scene_description_enriched": "A young, androgynous figure with curly blond hair and a halo stands in a natural setting, leaning against a tree trunk. They are dressed in a green tunic and a flowing red cloak. In their left hand, they hold an open book with a purple cover, adorned with gold lettering. Their right hand extends forward, holding a golden chalice from which a serpent emerges. At the figure's feet, a large bird, possibly an eagle, stands protectively. In the background, a crowd of people are depicted, some kneeling, around a central structure that appears to be a font or basin, suggesting a scene of baptism or a miracle. The overall impression is one of divine protection and miraculous power.",
