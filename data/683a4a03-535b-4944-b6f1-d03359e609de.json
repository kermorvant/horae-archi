    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts Saint John the Baptist, identifiable by his traditional iconography of a lamb and a staff with a banner, seated in a lush, green outdoor setting with trees. He is dressed in a fur garment over a blue and pink robe, and his gaze is directed towards the lamb. The lamb, a symbol of Christ, rests on a book, and a halo surrounds its head. Saint John also has a halo. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element with a decorative, patterned background, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
