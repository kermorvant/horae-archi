    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude figure, possibly representing Adam or Eve before the Fall, is seated on a textured surface, perhaps a rock or a rudimentary bench. The figure has long hair and is looking to the right. Behind the figure, foliage with clusters of berries, likely grapes, is visible, suggesting a natural setting. The figure's left hand rests on a draped object, possibly clothing or a piece of fabric, while the right hand is extended downwards. The overall scene evokes a sense of innocence and a connection to nature.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before the Fall, emphasizing their state of innocence and their connection to the natural world. The presence of grapes could allude to the Tree of Knowledge or the bounty of Eden.",
