    "scene_description_enriched": "A central figure, depicted as a muscular youth with long hair, stands triumphantly atop a golden, rocky structure, wielding a club raised high as if to strike. This figure appears to be battling or subduing a serpentine creature with a red tail, which coils around the base of the rock. Water cascades down from the rock and from two flanking sculptures of putti or cherubic figures, suggesting a fountain. The background is a vibrant blue, possibly representing the sky or water, with scattered gold flecks. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, golden archway with decorative elements.",
