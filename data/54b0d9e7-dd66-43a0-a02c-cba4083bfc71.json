    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, kneeling and holding a scroll, addressing the Virgin Mary on the right. The Virgin Mary, seated and holding an open book, looks towards the angel with a gesture of acceptance. Both figures are haloed. Behind them is a decorative screen with a geometric pattern of gold, blue, and red diamonds, surmounted by elaborate gold tracery. A column separates the two figures, and a scroll with Latin text unfurls from it. The setting appears to be an interior space with a green floor suggesting a garden or courtyard visible through an opening.",
