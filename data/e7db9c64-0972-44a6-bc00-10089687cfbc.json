    "scene_description_enriched": "A tormented, naked figure with skin appearing scorched and discolored is depicted amidst a rocky, infernal landscape. Flames, rendered in vibrant reds and golds, erupt from various points among the dark, jagged rocks, suggesting a scene of intense heat and suffering. The figure's face is contorted in anguish, with an open mouth and strained expression, and their arms are bound behind their back. The overall impression is one of punishment and despair within a hellish environment.",
