    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a man, seated in a landscape. He is looking upwards with his right hand raised, as if in prayer or supplication. He is dressed in a long robe and appears to be seated on the ground or a low surface. Behind him, a tree with foliage is visible, and in the distance, a fortified structure, possibly a castle or tower, is depicted against a hilly background. The entire scene is framed by an ornamental archway with decorative elements at the top. The style suggests a woodcut illustration, possibly from a devotional text.",
