    "scene_description_enriched": "A king, identifiable by his crown and scepter, presides over a scene involving several figures. To his left, a man in a cap and tunic stands. To his right, a woman with a veiled head and draped clothing is seated. In the foreground, a figure lies on the ground, possibly deceased or asleep, with a sword or staff extending over them. The background suggests an architectural setting with arched openings and decorative elements, possibly within a hall or chamber. The overall composition implies a scene of judgment, presentation, or a significant event involving royalty and other individuals.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely a depiction of a royal judgment or a significant event involving a king. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or devotional interpretation is difficult. However, the presence of a king, other figures, and a figure on the ground could allude to themes of justice, power, or even a narrative from secular history or legend.",
