    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and the wounds of crucifixion on his hands, feet, and side, reaching out to rescue a soul from hell. He is robed in pink and holds a cross staff. The soul, an elderly man with a beard, emerges from a fiery pit, his hands clasped in supplication. Behind him, other souls are visible, some engulfed in flames. To the right, a monstrous, multi-eyed demon looms, representing the forces of hell. The background is a stylized green landscape, suggesting the earthly realm from which Christ is descending to the underworld.",
