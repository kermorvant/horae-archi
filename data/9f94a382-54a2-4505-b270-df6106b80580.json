    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a prophet or saint, is depicted in a seated, contemplative pose, leaning forward with eyes closed and head bowed. They are draped in a blue mantle over a red garment, and their arms are wrapped around a scroll inscribed with text. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an archway, with golden decorative elements suggesting a divine or sacred context. Behind the figure, a textured, reddish-brown background is visible, possibly representing a wall or rock face, and a patch of green, suggesting foliage or ground cover. The overall impression is one of deep spiritual introspection or divine revelation.",
