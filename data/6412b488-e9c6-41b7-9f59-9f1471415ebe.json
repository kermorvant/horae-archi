    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a beard and long hair, dressed in dark robes, seated and engaged in writing or drawing on a piece of parchment. He is positioned in the foreground, with his head bowed in concentration. To his left, a lion-like creature is seated. Behind the man, an architectural structure is visible, featuring fluted columns supporting arches. Within one of these arched spaces, a relief sculpture depicts a group of figures kneeling before a central, elevated figure, possibly representing a divine or saintly visitation. Above this relief, a solitary standing figure is depicted within an arch, perhaps a saint or prophet.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents Saint Jerome, a prominent Church Father known for his scholarly work, including the translation of the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate). The lion is a common attribute of Saint Jerome, often depicted as having had a thorn removed from its paw by the saint. The relief sculpture in the background could allude to a biblical event or a moment of divine inspiration related to his writings.",
