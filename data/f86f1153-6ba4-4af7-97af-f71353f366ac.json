Saint Elizabeth is shown with her hand on the Virgin Mary's abdomen, a gesture signifying the pregnancy of both women. They are in an outdoor setting with rolling hills, a river, and a walled city with spires and towers in the background. To the left, there is a building with an arched entrance, suggesting a domestic or monastic structure.",
