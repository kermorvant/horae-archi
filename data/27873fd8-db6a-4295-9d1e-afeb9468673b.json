    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded monk, identified by his habit and halo, stands in a green landscape. He holds a red book in his left hand and a staff in his right. At his feet, a wild boar is depicted, and in the background, a river with a boat and distant buildings are visible. The scene is framed by a large, decorative letter 'B'. The monk's presence and the boar suggest an iconographic representation of Saint Anthony Abbot, known for his temptations by demons often depicted as animals.",
