    "scene_description_enriched": "A gathering of figures, predominantly men, are depicted kneeling or standing, with their hands clasped in prayer or raised towards the heavens. The central figure, a woman in a blue mantle, also has her hands in prayer. The figures are dressed in flowing robes of blue, red, and brown, with gold accents highlighting the folds of the fabric. The background is a plain, dark band, suggesting a celestial or spiritual setting rather than a specific earthly location. The scene is interpreted as the Pentecost, with the Virgin Mary and the Apostles awaiting the descent of the Holy Spirit.",
