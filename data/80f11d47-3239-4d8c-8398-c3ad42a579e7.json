The figures are dressed in medieval attire, with head coverings. Behind them, a stylized cityscape with towers and buildings is visible, framed by an arched structure. The foreground features a raised platform or altar-like structure with arched openings. The overall composition suggests a religious or devotional scene, possibly the Adoration of the Magi or a similar narrative involving the Virgin and Child.",
