    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine apparition. A central figure, likely Christ, stands on a cloud, radiating golden light and holding a red book. He is surrounded by a celestial background of red with golden stars and rays of light. Below him, several figures are shown in awe and supplication. Some are kneeling, looking upwards with hands clasped in prayer, while others are standing, gesturing towards the divine figure. The lower part of the image shows a green landscape with hints of yellow vegetation. Several trumpets are depicted emerging from the clouds below the central figure, suggesting a heavenly proclamation or judgment.",
