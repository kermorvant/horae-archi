    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Jerome, identifiable by his halo and scholarly attire, seated and writing. He is dressed in a golden tunic and a blue mantle, with a white beard and hair. He is shown at a lectern with an open book, holding a scroll. To his left, a winged, lion-like creature with pink wings and a halo sits on the floor, looking towards the viewer. The setting appears to be an interior space with tiled flooring, columns, and decorative architectural elements. A window on the left reveals a distant landscape. The overall impression is one of scholarly contemplation and divine inspiration, possibly representing the moment of Saint Jerome's translation of the Bible.",
