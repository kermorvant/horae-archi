    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures, likely laborers, are depicted in an outdoor setting, carrying scythes. The figure on the left wears a purple tunic with gold trim and a blue hat, while the figure on the right wears a blue tunic with gold trim and a red cap. Behind them, a simple, rustic building with a reddish-brown roof and a small window is visible. The ground is depicted as a path or field, with a stack of hay or straw to the left. The scene likely represents agricultural labor, possibly related to the harvest, which would be a common theme in Books of Hours associated with the liturgical calendar.",
