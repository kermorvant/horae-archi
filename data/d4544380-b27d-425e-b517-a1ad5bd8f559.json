    "scene_description_enriched": "A king, seated on a golden throne adorned with intricate patterns, gestures with his right hand while holding a scepter. He wears a jeweled crown and a purple robe over a patterned orange garment. Before him, soldiers in golden armor stand, one of whom holds a bloody infant. Another infant lies on the floor, also bloody. In the background, a stone wall suggests an interior setting, with a group of onlookers observing the scene. The overall depiction is of a brutal act of violence, likely the Massacre of the Innocents, ordered by a tyrannical ruler.",
