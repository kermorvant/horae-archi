    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Luke writing, seated on a raised platform within an interior space. He is dressed in a blue robe and has a halo, indicating his saintly status. Before him is a lectern with a manuscript. To his left, a winged ox, the symbol of Saint Luke, lies on the floor. The room features a large window overlooking a landscape with trees, hills, and buildings, suggesting a pastoral setting outside. The interior architecture includes columns, arches, and a vaulted ceiling decorated with stars. A rich tapestry with fleur-de-lis motifs hangs behind the saint. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern. The overall impression is one of scholarly contemplation and divine inspiration.",
