    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel kneeling on the left, presenting a lily to the Virgin Mary, who is seated on the right. Gabriel is depicted with large, colorful wings and is dressed in a white robe. Mary, with a halo, is shown with her hands raised in a gesture of acceptance or surprise, and she is looking down at a book. Behind Gabriel, an arched opening reveals a landscape with hills and a building, under a sky where a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a radiant sun. The figures are situated within an architectural setting characterized by large columns and arches, suggesting an interior space that opens to an exterior view.",
