    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by several figures. Christ, with a golden halo, is shown from the chest up, bearing a large wooden cross. To his left are two women, one veiled and with a halo, and another with a halo. To Christ's right, three figures in armor, possibly soldiers, are depicted. The background is a simple blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figures are rendered in a stylized manner typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
