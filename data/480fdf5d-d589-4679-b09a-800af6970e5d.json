    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king seated on a throne, holding a sword. Before him, a soldier in armor is presenting a baby, also holding a sword, to the king. A woman kneels between them, her hands clasped in supplication. The background features a patterned tapestry, and the floor is tiled in a red and orange checkerboard pattern. This is a representation of the Judgment of Solomon, where the king is asked to decide which of two women is the true mother of a child, by threatening to divide the child in half with his sword.",
