To her left, a stable-like structure with a thatched roof and brick walls is visible. A star shines brightly above. Three Magi are present: one, dressed in blue and wearing a yellow crown, points towards the star and holds a golden vessel. Another, kneeling and clad in a pink robe, offers a gift. The third, a crowned figure in a blue robe adorned with floral motifs, holds a golden orb. The background features rolling green hills and a starry blue sky. The scene is set outdoors, with elements of a humble dwelling.",
