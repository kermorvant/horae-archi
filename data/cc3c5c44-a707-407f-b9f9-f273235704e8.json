    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an interior architectural space framed by a golden arch. On the left, an elderly man with a long white beard, wearing a blue robe and a dark head covering, sits on a bench, leaning on a staff. He is looking towards the right. In the center, a younger man, dressed in a green tunic and a red robe, kneels on one knee, holding a bow and arrow, looking upwards with an expression of surprise or anticipation. Behind him, a large window with tracery shows a glimpse of an outdoor scene with figures on a balcony. The interior features a red curtain on the left and columns supporting arches. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern. The overall impression is one of a narrative moment within a structured, possibly palatial or religious, setting.",
