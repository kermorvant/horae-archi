    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a female saint, identified by her halo and the cross she holds, within a fortified tower. She is dressed in a pink robe and has her hands clasped to her chest. A monstrous, dragon-like creature with fiery breath emerges from the base of the tower, seemingly attacking or threatening the saint. Above and to the right, a bust of a bearded figure, possibly God or an angel, is depicted in a blue cloud. The tower itself is rendered in a light yellow stone with crenellated battlements and arched openings. The surrounding decorative border features geometric patterns and floral motifs in red, blue, and gold.",
