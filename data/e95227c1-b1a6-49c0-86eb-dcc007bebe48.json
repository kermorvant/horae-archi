    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a crown, with his hands clasped in prayer. He is positioned within an architectural frame, suggested by the presence of decorative elements and what appears to be a column on the right. The style is reminiscent of woodcut illustrations, with heavy hatching for shading. The man's posture and attire suggest he is a figure of importance, possibly a king or a saint.",
