    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, a scene unfolds featuring three figures. On the left, a child, swaddled in white cloth, reclines in a boat-like vessel. Facing the child is a robed figure with a halo, raising one hand in a gesture of blessing or command, while the other hand is extended towards the child. Behind this central figure, another robed individual stands, also with a halo, their hands clasped. The background is a rich gold, speckled with tiny dots, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with distinct facial features and flowing robes.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a miracle or a significant event involving a saint and a child. The halos suggest sanctity. The gesture of the central figure could represent a blessing, healing, or a divine intervention. Without further iconographic clues, a specific event is difficult to pinpoint, but it falls within the realm of hagiography or devotional imagery.",
