    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with God the Father positioned behind him, supporting the cross. Christ is shown with a halo and a crown of thorns, his body emaciated and draped in a white loincloth. God the Father, also with a halo, wears a blue robe and a crown, and holds a tablet inscribed with 'IMRI'. The figures are set against a backdrop of patterned curtains and architectural elements, including what appear to be stained-glass windows. The foreground features a checkered floor and decorative architectural elements, suggesting a divine or celestial setting.",
