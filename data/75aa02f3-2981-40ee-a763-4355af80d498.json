    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a nude female figure emerging from water, with her body partially submerged. She is shown from the waist up, with her arms extended. Her hair is long and wavy. Behind her, foliage and a dotted pattern suggest a natural or stylized background. The figure appears to be in motion, possibly bathing or emerging from a body of water. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a scene from classical mythology or a secular context, rather than a biblical or devotional one, given the nudity and the lack of specific religious iconography. It could be a depiction of a nymph, a bather, or a figure associated with water deities.",
