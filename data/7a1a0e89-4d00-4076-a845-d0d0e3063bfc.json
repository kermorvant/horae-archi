    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic struggle in a natural setting with trees and clouds. A central figure, possibly a divine or heroic entity, is shown descending from the sky, with rays of light emanating from above. Below, several monstrous creatures, resembling lions with grotesque features and possibly a dragon-like head, are attacking or being attacked. One creature appears to be a lion with a human-like face, and another has a more bestial, roaring visage. The overall impression is one of conflict and divine intervention against monstrous forces.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a battle against demonic or chaotic forces, possibly referencing the triumph of good over evil, or a specific biblical narrative such as the binding of Satan or the victory of an archangel over demons. The divine light suggests heavenly intervention.",
