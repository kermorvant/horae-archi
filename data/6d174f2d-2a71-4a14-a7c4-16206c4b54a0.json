    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary kneeling before a lectern, her hands clasped in prayer or contemplation. An open book rests on a small stool beside her. To her left, a lectern holds another book. Above and to the right, the Angel Gabriel, clad in red and blue, descends from a richly patterned, tessellated sky, holding a scroll that unfurls with the inscription 'Ave Maria, plena dns tecum'. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers near Mary. The setting is indoors, suggested by the patterned wall and floor, with a vase of lilies on a checkered floor to the right.",
