    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures standing beneath a decorative arch. On the left, a bearded man with a hat clasps his hands in prayer. In the center, a woman with a veiled head and folded arms looks forward. To the right, another man, also wearing a hat, stands with his arms crossed. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior space, possibly a hall or a room within a building, with a dotted background that could represent a starry sky or a decorative tapestry. The overall composition suggests a devotional or narrative scene, possibly related to a biblical event or a saint's life, though specific identification is not possible from the visual cues alone.",
