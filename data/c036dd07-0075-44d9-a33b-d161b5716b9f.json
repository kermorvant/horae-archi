The man on the left wears a grey tunic, trousers, and boots, and carries a staff and a stone in his raised hand. The man on the right wears a red tunic, trousers, and boots, and also carries a staff, with his hand raised to his head. Their clothing appears worn, suggesting they are travelers or engaged in manual labor. The scene is likely a depiction of David and Goliath, with David preparing to throw the stone at Goliath.",
