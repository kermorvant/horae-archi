    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit, with the Virgin Mary at the center, surrounded by a group of figures, likely the Apostles, all with hands clasped in prayer. Above them, a radiant dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from a golden light. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that suggests an interior space, possibly a room or a chapel, with arched openings visible in the background. Two kneeling figures, one in black and white habit and the other in a red robe, are positioned in the foreground, also in prayer. A coat of arms is displayed between them. The overall atmosphere is one of devotion and divine inspiration.",
