    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue robe, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child, with a golden halo, is looking upwards. Three Magi are present: one kneels before Mary and the Child, offering a golden vessel; another stands behind him, also holding a golden vessel and pointing upwards; and a third, older man with a blue hood, stands to the right, with his hand to his forehead. The figures are framed by an architectural element, possibly a loggia or a decorative archway, with golden ornamentation. In the background, there is a dark, rough structure and a hint of greenery and a blue sky with a golden starburst.",
