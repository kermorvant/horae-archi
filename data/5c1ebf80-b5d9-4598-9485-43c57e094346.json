    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity, with God the Father seated centrally, wearing a papal tiara and a long grey beard, holding the crucified Christ. Christ is shown in his crucifixion pose, with his arms outstretched on the cross. A white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers to the left of God the Father. Two winged figures, likely angels, flank God the Father, one on each side. The figures are set against a blue background, with a rich canopy draped above them, supported by decorative columns. The overall composition is framed by an ornate border with gold and blue decorative elements.",
