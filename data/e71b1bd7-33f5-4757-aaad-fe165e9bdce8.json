    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures, likely soldiers or attendants, is depicted. They are shown from the waist up, with their faces turned to the side. The figures are dressed in tunics and some are holding staffs or spears. Behind them, vertical elements that resemble architectural supports or banners are visible. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with a ground line indicated at the bottom. The exact religious or biblical event is not clearly identifiable from the visual cues alone, but the presence of multiple figures in procession could suggest a narrative scene from the Passion of Christ or a saint's life.",
