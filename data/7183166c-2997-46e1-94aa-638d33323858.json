    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men gathered in what appears to be a courtyard or open area in front of a building with arched windows and a tower. In the foreground, two central figures are engaged in conversation, one in a blue robe and the other in a golden robe, both holding scrolls with text. Surrounding them are other men, some in turbans and elaborate hats, and others in more common attire. To the left, a richly decorated red textile with golden sunburst patterns is visible, possibly a tapestry or banner. In the background, a city with spires and towers is nestled among rolling hills under a blue sky. The overall impression is one of a significant event or meeting taking place within a structured, possibly urban, environment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scrolls held by the central figures and the presence of multiple individuals suggest a scene of dialogue, negotiation, or perhaps a religious or legal proceeding. Without specific iconography or context from the surrounding text, a precise interpretation is difficult. However, the presence of figures in varied attire, including some with what might be interpreted as religious or scholarly headwear, and the architectural setting, points towards a narrative scene from the Bible or a hagiographic account.",
