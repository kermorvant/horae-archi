    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint George, clad in armor and a red cape, mounted on a white horse. He is shown in the act of slaying a dragon, though the dragon itself is not explicitly visible. Instead, two fallen figures, presumably representing defeated enemies or the dragon's victims, lie beneath the horse's hooves. The background features a stylized representation of buildings, possibly a town or city, with towers and roofs. The overall composition suggests a triumphant victory, likely attributed to the saint's divine intervention.",
