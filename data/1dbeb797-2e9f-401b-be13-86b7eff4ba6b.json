    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, an angel, identified by wings and a halo, kneels and presents a scroll to the Virgin Mary, who is seated on the right. The angel is dressed in a pink robe and has hands clasped in prayer. The Virgin Mary, also with a halo, wears a blue robe and holds an open book in her lap, with her hands also in a gesture of prayer or contemplation. The background features red drapery and architectural elements, including arches and columns, suggesting an interior space. Above the main figures, a smaller scene shows a bearded figure holding a sphere.",
