    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and the cross she holds, stands with her hands clasped in prayer. She is depicted in the foreground, facing a fearsome dragon that lies before her, its mouth open and red tongue extended. The saint wears a golden dress and a crimson cloak adorned with gold patterns. The dragon is dark brown with yellow spots and sharp claws. Behind the saint, a lush green landscape unfolds, dotted with trees and rolling hills. In the middle ground, a river or body of water is visible with several sailing ships. Further in the background, a fortified castle with multiple towers and spires dominates the scene, set against a backdrop of blue mountains. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
