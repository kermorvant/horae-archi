    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint, stands in profile, her gaze directed downwards and to the right. She wears a long, flowing white garment with elaborate pleating at the hem, and a dark cloak draped over her shoulders. To her left, a small, pale pink tower with arched openings and a domed roof rises. In the background, a stylized cityscape with spires is depicted in shades of blue. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
