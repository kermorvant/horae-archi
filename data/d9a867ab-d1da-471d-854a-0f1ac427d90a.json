    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a saint or prophet, kneels on a checkered floor, wearing a blue robe adorned with gold flecks over a red tunic. He holds an open book, writing with a quill. Behind him, a desk with books and writing implements is visible, along with architectural elements suggesting an interior space, including arched structures and a window. To his right, a winged lion, a common symbol of St. Mark, rests. The scene is likely an illustration of a Gospel writer or a prophet inspired to write.",
