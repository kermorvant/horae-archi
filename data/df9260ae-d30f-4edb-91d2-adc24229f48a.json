    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Jacob's dream, with Jacob lying on the ground in the foreground, asleep. Above him, a ladder extends into a starry, red sky, with golden clouds. An angel ascends the ladder, reaching towards a figure at the top who is likely God, depicted with a halo and holding a book. In the middle ground, two figures embrace, one with red wings, suggesting an angel, and the other in a blue robe. Another figure in a blue robe stands to the right, observing the scene. A white horse is also visible on the right side of the image. The overall setting is a dreamscape, with the earthly realm represented by the green ground and the celestial realm by the red, starry sky.",
