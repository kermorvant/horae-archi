    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with blonde hair, wearing a blue robe adorned with gold trim, stands in an arched doorway, raising her hand as if in greeting or farewell. To her left, another figure, also in a blue robe, leans out of a window in a brick building, their hand raised. To the right, a man in a similar blue robe, with red boots, walks away, his hands clasped in prayer or supplication. The background is a richly patterned tapestry or mosaic of small squares in red, blue, and gold. The architecture suggests a domestic setting with a prominent building featuring a timber-framed upper story and a brick lower story with arched openings.",
