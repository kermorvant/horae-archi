    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed women in a verdant, rolling landscape dotted with trees and winding paths. The woman on the left, dressed in a vibrant blue robe, stands with her hands clasped. The woman on the right, wearing a blue veil, an orange tunic, and a green overskirt, gestures towards the first woman with her right hand, while her left hand appears to be holding a book or scroll. In the background, a city with numerous buildings, spires, and towers is visible, nestled amongst rolling hills. The overall impression is one of a pastoral setting leading to an urban center, with a focus on the interaction between the two figures.",
