    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by the Virgin Mary and two other figures. Christ, barefoot and robed, struggles under the weight of a large wooden cross. To his left, the Virgin Mary, also barefoot and veiled, looks on with sorrow, her hand touching her face. To Christ's right, two men, one in a conical hat and holding a palm frond, and another in a pointed hat, appear to be part of the procession, possibly soldiers or onlookers. The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, emphasizing the emotional weight of the moment.",
