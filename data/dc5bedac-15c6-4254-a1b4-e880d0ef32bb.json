Elizabeth is holding a red object, possibly a book or a gift, towards Mary. They are positioned in a verdant outdoor setting with stylized trees and small flowers. Behind them, to the right, is a brick building with a stone arched doorway leading to an interior with a checkered floor and stairs. In the background, a large castle with towers and crenellations is visible.",
