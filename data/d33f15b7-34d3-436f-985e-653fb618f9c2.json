    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three emaciated, nude figures in a barren landscape under a blue sky. The figure on the left, facing away from the viewer, is draped with a white cloth and appears to be carrying a large, spade-like object over its shoulder. Two other figures stand to the right, also nude and gaunt, with one reaching out to touch the other. Their skeletal features and distressed expressions suggest suffering or death. The background features rolling hills with sparse vegetation and a few trees, indicative of an outdoor setting.",
