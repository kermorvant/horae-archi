    "scene_description_enriched": "In a rocky, outdoor setting, Christ kneels in prayer, looking upwards towards a chalice bathed in divine light descending from above. His hands are clasped in supplication. In the foreground, three disciples sleep: Peter rests his head on his hand, while two others, one with a red halo and the other with a golden halo, also appear to be asleep. The landscape is barren and rocky, with sparse vegetation and a distant castle on a hill. The scene depicts the Agony in the Garden, a moment of intense prayer and suffering for Christ before his arrest.",
