    "scene_description_enriched": "A person, likely a monk or religious figure due to their habit and hood, is seated at a table, engaged in eating or preparing to eat. The table is covered with a cloth and set with a bowl, a spoon, and a knife. Behind the figure, a jug or pitcher is visible on a shelf or surface, and above, a decorative canopy or ceiling element, possibly representing grapes or foliage, is depicted. The architectural setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the presence of a table and the implied enclosure.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a monastic meal or a devotional representation of simple sustenance, common in religious contexts. The figure's attire suggests a religious order, and the act of eating is a fundamental human activity often imbued with spiritual significance in medieval art, representing temperance or the fulfillment of basic needs within a spiritual life.",
