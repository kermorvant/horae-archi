    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two female figures, likely the Virgin Mary and Saint Anne, seated and engaged with a book. The elder figure, possibly Saint Anne, wears a white veil and a red mantle over a blue garment, and holds an open book on her lap, her hands resting on its pages. Beside her, a younger figure, likely the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue gown, looks towards the book. Both figures have golden halos, indicating their saintly status. The background is a plain green fabric with gold decorative elements, suggesting an interior setting. The overall composition is devotional, focusing on the figures and their interaction with the sacred text.",
