    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, veiled in blue and adorned with a golden halo, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child in her arms. Saint Joseph, an elderly man with a white beard, walks beside them, holding a staff and wearing a hooded cloak. In the background, rolling green hills are dotted with trees, and on a distant hill, a fortified castle is visible. Below the figures, a decorative border frames a band of text with illuminated initials and a scroll, suggesting this is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
