    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a figure, likely a king or a noble, shown in profile, looking upwards and to the left. The figure has a beard and wears a crown and a draped garment. The background is filled with a dense pattern of small dots, suggesting a textured or perhaps celestial setting. To the right and left of the figure, architectural elements resembling columns or pilasters are visible, framing the scene. Above, there is a decorative arch or canopy structure. The overall impression is one of reverence or supplication.",
