    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely God the Father, with a long beard and flowing hair, enthroned on a decorated chair. He is draped in robes and holds a book or tablet on his lap, which is adorned with multiple eyes. To his left, a winged figure, possibly an angel or a cherub, is shown embracing the seated figure's arm. Above them, seven stylized flames or lamps are depicted, suggesting divine presence or inspiration. The overall setting is abstract and symbolic, with no discernible architectural elements beyond the throne.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents God the Father, possibly in a moment of divine contemplation or revelation. The multiple eyes on the book/tablet could symbolize omniscience or divine vision. The seven flames are often associated with the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit or the seven eyes of God mentioned in the Book of Revelation. The embracing figure might represent a divine messenger or a soul in communion with God.",
