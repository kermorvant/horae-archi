    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, dressed in a white tunic, yellow undergarment, white hose, and dark shoes, walks across a field, sowing seeds. He wears a straw hat and has a beard. His left arm is bent, holding a basket of seeds, while his right arm is extended, scattering seeds onto the tilled earth. A tree with green foliage stands to the left of the scene, against a vibrant blue sky dotted with golden clouds. The ground is depicted as ploughed furrows, with small green shoots emerging in places. The scene likely represents the Parable of the Sower, a teaching of Jesus about the different ways people receive the word of God.",
