    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body emaciated and bleeding. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, stands with her hands clasped, her face etched with sorrow, accompanied by another woman. To the right, a soldier in a purple tunic and a distinctive helmet, holding a spear, gestures towards the cross. Behind him, other figures, including a young man in an orange tunic, are visible, along with a banner bearing a heraldic device. The setting is an outdoor landscape with a rocky hill and a pale blue sky, suggesting the event takes place on Golgotha. The inscription 'INRI' is visible on the cross.",
