    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral landscape, two shepherds are startled by a winged figure descending from the sky. The figure, clad in a golden robe and with large wings, appears to be an angel. One shepherd, kneeling with hands raised in awe or fear, wears a blue tunic with an orange hood and brown boots. The other shepherd, seated and looking upwards with a similar expression of surprise, is dressed in a green tunic and purple robe. A flock of sheep is gathered between them. In the background, a town or castle with towers and walls is visible, nestled amongst rolling hills and trees. The scene depicts a moment of divine revelation to humble shepherds.",
