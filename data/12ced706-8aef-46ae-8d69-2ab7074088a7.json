    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely female given the long hair and attire, is depicted in profile, facing right. She wears a red tunic over a blue garment, a green belt with gold clasps, and a white and red headdress. Her left hand points forward, while her right hand holds a scepter-like object with decorative elements. The background is a starry blue sky, suggesting an outdoor or celestial setting. The figure's posture and the object she holds are not definitively identifiable as a specific biblical or devotional scene without further context.",
