    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, kneels in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies naked on the green ground. Behind Mary is a simple wooden stable structure with a thatched roof. To the right, a bearded figure in a pink robe and green turban, likely Joseph, is shown with his hands raised in a gesture of awe or blessing. The background features a grassy landscape with scattered flowers and trees, and a rocky hill on the right. A radiant sun with rays emanates from the top of the sky, symbolizing divine presence.",
