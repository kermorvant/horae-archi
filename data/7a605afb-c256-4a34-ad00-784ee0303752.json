    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered under an architectural arch. On the right, a figure with a halo, presumably Christ, is shown in profile, gesturing with his right hand. He is surrounded by other figures, some of whom are looking towards him. In the foreground on the left, a kneeling figure is visible. In the background, rudimentary architectural elements suggest a building or cityscape. The overall composition suggests a religious narrative, likely a moment of teaching or discourse.",
