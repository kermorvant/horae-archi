    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures, one above the other, framed by decorative borders. The upper figure, a bearded man wearing a hat and a richly patterned robe, is shown from the waist up, with his left hand gesturing. Below him, another bearded man, also wearing a hat and a patterned garment, is depicted from the chest up, with his hands clasped in prayer or contemplation. A star is visible to the left of this lower figure. The overall style suggests a woodcut illustration, possibly from a devotional text.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of a star and the contemplative posture of the lower figure, along with the rich attire of both figures, could suggest a scene related to the Magi or a prophetic vision. Without further context, a definitive interpretation is difficult, but it likely relates to a biblical narrative or devotional theme.",
