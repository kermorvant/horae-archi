    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two men engaged in agricultural labor in a rural landscape. The foreground shows a man on the left digging with a shovel and another man on the right using a hoe. Both are dressed in medieval attire, with blue tunics adorned with gold patterns, red caps, and patterned stockings. The background features a hilly terrain with bare trees, suggesting a colder season, and a distant village with houses. A body of water with a small boat is also visible. The overall impression is one of seasonal work and rural life.",
