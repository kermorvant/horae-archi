    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a brown cross, likely representing the True Cross or the Crucifixion, set against a vibrant blue background dotted with golden stars. Above the cross, a white plaque bears the inscription \"I N R A\" (likely an abbreviation for Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum, \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\"). The cross is rooted in a green, grassy ground, with some darker foliage and grey rocky elements at the base. The overall impression is one of solemnity and religious significance, possibly alluding to Christ's sacrifice and the celestial realm.",
