    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ritual. In the background, Christ, with a halo and crown of thorns, stands in a stone basin, his body marked with wounds. Above him, various instruments of the Passion are displayed against a starry blue background, including a hammer, tongs, a spear, and a scourge. To the left, a column supports a bundle of reeds and a sword. In the foreground, a priest in ornate vestments holds a chalice with a host, raising it towards Christ in prayer. He is flanked by two other figures, one in a red robe and the other in monastic attire. A ladder leans against the structure behind Christ, suggesting his placement or descent. The overall setting appears to be a symbolic representation of the Mass or a devotional scene related to the Passion.",
