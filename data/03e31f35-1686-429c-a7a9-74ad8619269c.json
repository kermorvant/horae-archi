    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bearded man, identified as Saint Bartholomew, standing within an arched architectural frame. He wears a red tunic and a blue mantle, both trimmed with gold. In his left hand, he holds a book with musical notation, and in his right, a long staff. Behind him, a vaulted ceiling is visible, and to his left, a window looks out onto a landscape with trees and a blue vase on a ledge. The overall setting suggests an interior space with an opening to the exterior.",
