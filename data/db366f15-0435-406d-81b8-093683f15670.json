    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures engaged in agricultural labor outdoors under a starry blue sky. The figure on the left, dressed in a vibrant orange tunic and green mantle, is actively digging with a shovel. This figure wears a red cap, white stockings, and black shoes. The figure on the right, clad in a muted green garment and a pinkish cap, is bent over, seemingly planting seeds or tending to the ground with their hand. The landscape is rendered with green hills and scattered yellow flowers, suggesting a cultivated field. The overall impression is one of diligent work in the fields.",
