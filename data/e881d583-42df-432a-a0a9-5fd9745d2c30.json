    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a saint, dressed in a red hat and red robes with gold trim, is depicted reading a book. The figure has a halo, indicating sanctity. To the right of the figure, a small, furry creature, possibly a monkey or a demon, is reaching up towards the book. The scene is framed by an ornate border of foliage and birds, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript. The background appears to be an architectural interior, with a golden, ornate structure behind the figure and a blue, curtain-like element to the left.",
