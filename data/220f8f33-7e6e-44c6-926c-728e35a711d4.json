    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central seated figure, likely Christ, wearing a golden robe and a blue hat, pointing with one hand and holding a scroll or book in the other. To his left stands a figure in a red robe and blue hat, with a blue, monstrous head behind him. To Christ's right stands a figure in a grey and purple robe, also wearing a blue hat, with a red, demonic figure behind him. The background is a textured red, suggesting a divine or symbolic space, with hints of architectural elements like a patterned floor and vertical lines that might represent drapery or a simple wall.",
