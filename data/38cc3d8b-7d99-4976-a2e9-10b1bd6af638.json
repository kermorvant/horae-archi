    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely Saint Jerome, stands in a room with patterned walls and architectural elements. He wears a red robe over a blue and purple tunic and holds a green book. To his left, a lion with bared teeth and claws is depicted. The inscription above the figure reads 'RHEE AWIS FI FLOTS PAIR RIE OISIMEI OGERO'. The scene appears to be set indoors, within a space that suggests an architectural interior.",
