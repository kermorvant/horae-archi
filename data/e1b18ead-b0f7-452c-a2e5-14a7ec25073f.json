    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, bound to a column, is shown covered in blood, with wounds visible on his body. Two tormentors are actively scourging him. The figure on the left, dressed in a red and blue tunic, holds a bundle of rods and appears to be spitting. The figure on the right, wearing a white tunic and red hose, wields a whip with barbed ends. The setting is an interior space with a tiled floor and a large column supporting a circular window with tracery. The overall impression is one of intense suffering and brutality.",
