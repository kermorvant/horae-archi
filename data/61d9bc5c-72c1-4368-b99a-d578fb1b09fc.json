    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a book, with the Virgin Mary at the center, her hands clasped in prayer. To her left, a male figure with a halo and a crown-like headdress also prays. To her right, another figure, possibly a woman, with a halo, also prays. Behind them, several other figures with halos are visible, their faces turned towards the center. Above them, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from a dark, radiating sky. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting suggested by an archway and decorative border, with a tiled floor beneath them. This scene represents the Descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and the Virgin Mary, an event known as Pentecost.",
