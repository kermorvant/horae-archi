    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey through a rocky, hilly landscape under a pale blue sky with scattered clouds. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and red tunic, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child. Joseph, in a tan cloak and red hat, walks beside the donkey, holding a staff. The figures are framed by an architectural archway with decorative columns and capitals, suggesting a transition from a structured space to the open road. The overall impression is one of humble travel and divine protection.",
