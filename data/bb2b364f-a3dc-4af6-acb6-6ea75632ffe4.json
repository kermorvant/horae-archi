    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely a king or ruler, wearing a crown and elaborate robes, positioned within an architectural niche. To the right, a group of figures, some appearing distressed or in conflict, are shown. One figure, possibly a soldier or guard, is in the foreground, holding or interacting with other individuals. The background features a decorative tapestry or wall hanging with a repeating geometric pattern. The overall composition suggests a narrative event involving authority and possibly violence or subjugation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely a depiction of a historical or biblical event involving a ruler and his subjects, possibly illustrating a moment of judgment, conflict, or the consequences of a ruler's actions. Without further context or clearer iconography, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it could relate to themes of justice, power, or suffering.",
