    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary seated on the right, dressed in a blue robe, and the Angel Gabriel kneeling on the left, clad in a pink garment. The Angel holds a scroll with Latin text, and both figures are positioned near a lectern with an open book. Behind the Virgin Mary is a red canopy bed, and in the background, architectural elements suggest a church interior with statues in niches. The overall setting is indoors, within a richly decorated space.",
