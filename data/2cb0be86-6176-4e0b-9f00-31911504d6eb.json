    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures walking along a path in a rural landscape. On the left, a woman carries a basket of eggs on her head and another basket in her hand. She wears a red gown over a blue skirt and a white head covering. Beside her, a man carries a large basket on his back and wears a blue tunic and red cap. To the right, a third figure, possibly a man, stands holding a staff and wearing a red tunic and blue hose. In the background, a building with a thatched roof and a fortified structure with arched openings are visible, set against a backdrop of blue mountains. The overall impression is one of daily life and travel in a medieval setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a biblical or devotional narrative, possibly depicting travelers or pilgrims. Without specific iconographic clues, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact event. However, the presence of baskets and the journey motif could allude to themes of sustenance, labor, or spiritual pilgrimage.",
