    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude female figure, possibly representing a personification or a biblical character, is depicted seated. She has long, flowing hair and is shown with her left arm bent, holding a vessel or jug. Her right arm is extended, and she appears to be pouring liquid from another vessel into a basin or trough. The background features foliage, possibly grapes, and a textured surface behind her, suggesting a natural or domestic setting. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a personification of a virtue or a specific biblical narrative. Given the pouring of liquid, it could relate to a scene of charity, purification, or a specific event involving water. Without further context or identifying attributes, a precise interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of sustenance or ritual.",
