    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross in the center, surrounded by a lush green landscape with trees. To the left, a bearded man with a halo kneels in prayer, wearing a white robe and appearing to be in distress. Behind him, a lion-like creature is depicted. In the background, a building with a blue roof and a tower is visible, suggesting a religious or monastic setting. Another figure, possibly a mourner, is partially visible kneeling in the lower right corner, draped in a red garment. The overall atmosphere is one of solemnity and devotion.",
