    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man with reddish-brown hair, wearing a purple cloak over a blue garment, stands in a landscape. He holds a long staff and has his hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. Behind him, a lush green hillside is dotted with trees and a path. In the distance, a complex of buildings with spires and towers is visible, suggesting a town or castle. Rays of golden light emanate from the upper right corner, illuminating the scene.",
