    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a tent interior where a wounded man lies on a bed, his chest bleeding. Two women are attending to him. One woman, dressed in red and yellow, holds a severed head, possibly of the man's assailant, while the other woman, in blue, appears to be tending to the wounded man. A sword lies on the ground next to the bed. Outside the tent, a landscape unfolds with numerous other tents, suggesting a camp or encampment. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible.",
