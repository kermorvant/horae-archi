Saint Christopher, a bearded man with a halo, wears a red cloak over a blue tunic and holds a staff. The Christ Child, also with a halo and radiating golden rays, points upwards with his right hand. They are in a body of water, with rocky formations on either side. A solitary tree stands to the left. The background is a rich red with intricate gold scrollwork, suggesting a divine or elevated setting. The border of the illumination is composed of gold, blue, and red bands.",
