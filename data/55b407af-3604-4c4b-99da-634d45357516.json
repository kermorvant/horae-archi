    "scene_description_enriched": "Two crowned figures, likely a king and queen, are seated on a bench. The figure on the left, dressed in pink, has their hands clasped near their face, possibly in prayer or contemplation. The figure on the right, in a blue robe adorned with gold fleur-de-lis patterns, holds a golden object, perhaps a crown or a reliquary, in their lap. They are positioned within a decorative architectural frame featuring a trefoil arch and a background of gold and blue diamond patterns. The scene is framed by a border with intricate geometric and foliate motifs. The overall impression is one of royal dignity and possibly a devotional or ceremonial moment.",
