    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered indoors, beneath a vaulted ceiling supported by columns. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from above. The figures, dressed in medieval attire, appear to be listening or praying, with some gesturing. The architectural setting suggests a religious or significant communal space, possibly a church or a hall, with ornate columns and a sense of solemnity. The presence of the dove strongly indicates a Pentecostal event.",
