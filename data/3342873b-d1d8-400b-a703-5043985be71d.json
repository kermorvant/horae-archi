    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered under a dark, beamed canopy, suggesting an interior or sheltered outdoor space. On the left, a haloed woman, likely the Virgin Mary, holds a swaddled infant, the Christ Child, who is reaching out. To their right, a kneeling figure, possibly a donor or saint, holds a chalice. Behind them, two figures stand, one with a crown and a raised finger, possibly a king or prophet, and another woman holding a chalice. The background is indistinct, with hints of architectural elements or a stylized landscape. The overall composition suggests a devotional scene, possibly related to the Nativity or a saint's life, with an emphasis on veneration and the presentation of offerings.",
