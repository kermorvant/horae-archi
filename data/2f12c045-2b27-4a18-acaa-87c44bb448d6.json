    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some with beards and wearing blue and brown robes, are gathered around a tree with green foliage against a starry blue background. Some men reach towards the tree's branches, while others are shown bending down towards a grassy, undulating ground with white, cloud-like forms. The scene appears to depict a moment of gathering or observation related to the tree and the ground below.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Gathering of Manna, a biblical event from the Book of Exodus where God provided manna, a food, for the Israelites in the desert. The tree might symbolize the divine source of sustenance, and the white forms on the ground could represent the manna itself, being collected by the people.",
