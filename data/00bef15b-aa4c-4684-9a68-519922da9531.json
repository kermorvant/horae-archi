    "scene_description_enriched": "A stylized tree with abundant green foliage and orange-centered blossoms stands on a grassy mound against a blue, star-filled sky. Two heraldic shields are attached to the tree's trunk: a red shield on the left depicts a nude male figure with a beard, holding a shield and a club, seemingly in combat with a snake coiled around his arm; a black shield on the right contains a seated white cat. The scene is framed by a golden border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a genealogical or heraldic tree, possibly illustrating the lineage or alliances of a noble family. The figures on the shields are symbolic. The male figure with the snake could represent a saint, a mythological hero, or a family crest. The cat is also a common heraldic symbol. The overall composition suggests a symbolic representation rather than a narrative biblical or devotional scene.",
