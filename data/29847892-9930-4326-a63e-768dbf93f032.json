    "scene_description_enriched": "A grand architectural setting features a prominent, multi-tiered structure with arches and ornate detailing, suggesting a palace or temple. A crowd of people gathers, some looking up towards a raised platform where a bishop, adorned in ceremonial robes and a mitre, is being presented with a book by attendants. Below, a regal woman in a blue gown, holding a basket with doves, stands on a wide staircase, facing the viewer. Other figures, including children and men in various attire, are also present, some ascending the stairs. The scene is set against a backdrop of elaborate buildings with towers and windows, under a blue sky with clouds.",
