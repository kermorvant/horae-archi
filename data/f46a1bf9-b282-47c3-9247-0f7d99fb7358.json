She is dressed in a blue mantle over a patterned garment and wears a green veil. The throne is ornate, with a high back and a green canopy draped around it. To the right, a bearded man in a red robe kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. The setting appears to be an interior space with stone walls and large windows revealing a landscape outside. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with foliage and birds.",
