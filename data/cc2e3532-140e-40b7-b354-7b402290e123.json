    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted seated within an architectural niche. She wears a golden gown and a blue mantle, with a white headdress. Her head is bowed, and her eyes are closed in contemplation. In her right hand, she holds a wreath of thorns, a symbol of Christ's Passion. The architectural setting features columns with sculpted figures in niches, and a decorative arch behind her. The background suggests an outdoor setting with a blue sky and a distant structure. The overall scene evokes a sense of sorrowful piety and reflection on Christ's sacrifice.",
