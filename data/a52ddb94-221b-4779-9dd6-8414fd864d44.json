    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and cloaked in blue, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Child reaches out towards a golden chalice presented by one of the three Magi, who are kneeling and offering gifts. The Magi are richly dressed, one wearing a crown and a green cloak, another a red cloak, and the third, who is kneeling, wears a blue garment and a yellow cloak. Behind them, a figure in a red cloak and blue tunic holds a candle. The background features dark, rough-hewn architecture with arched openings and a starry night sky with a radiant star above. The overall setting suggests a humble dwelling or stable.",
