    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a martyrdom, likely of a saint, set in an outdoor landscape. A central figure, wearing a red robe and white undergarment, kneels with hands clasped in prayer. This figure has a halo and appears to be bleeding from the head, with drops of blood visible on the face and robe. Two other figures, dressed in yellow and blue tunics respectively, are shown in the act of stoning the kneeling figure. The figure on the left, in yellow, raises a stone above their head, while the figure on the right, in blue, also prepares to throw a stone. The background features rolling green hills, scattered trees, and distant architectural structures resembling castles or towers. The overall impression is one of violence and religious persecution.",
