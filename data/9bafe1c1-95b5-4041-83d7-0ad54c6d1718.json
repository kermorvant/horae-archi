    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with his body rendered in a pale, emaciated state, bleeding from wounds. He is affixed to a wooden cross. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, accompanied by two other figures, likely John the Evangelist and another woman, all with halos. A figure in a golden robe kneels at the base of the cross, also with a halo. To the right, a group of soldiers and onlookers are present, some on horseback. One soldier, wearing a helmet and armor, points towards the cross. In the background, a city with numerous buildings, including towers and walls, is visible, situated on a body of water with boats. The sky is a vibrant blue, with golden rays emanating from above the cross, suggesting divine light. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, gilded border with floral motifs.",
