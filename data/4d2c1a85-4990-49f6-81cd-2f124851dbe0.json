    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition from the Cross. Christ's body, wrapped in a white shroud, is being lowered from the cross by two figures. One figure, wearing a pink tunic, stands on a ladder leaning against the cross, holding Christ's legs. Another figure, in a brown robe and dark hat, supports Christ's torso. Below, a bearded man in a red robe kneels, reaching up to assist. To the left, the Virgin Mary, with a halo, kneels in prayer, her hands clasped. The background features a green, hilly landscape with stylized trees and a distant city skyline with spires. The overall scene is rendered in a flat, stylized manner typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
