    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, depicted with a beard and wearing a hat, an orange tunic, and boots, is shown scattering seeds on a golden, striped ground. He carries a white sack over his shoulder and a dark pouch at his waist. The scene is framed by an ornate, quatrefoil-shaped border with a red background decorated with a repeating gold pattern of stylized leaves and diamonds. The overall setting appears to be an agricultural field, suggested by the act of sowing and the striped ground representing furrows.",
