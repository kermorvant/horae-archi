    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man and a woman holding hands, with two children standing beside them. The background is a rich blue, adorned with golden floral motifs and radiating lines suggesting divine light or a starry sky. The man, bearded and wearing a blue tunic and a golden cloak, extends his right hand towards the woman. The woman, dressed in a pink gown, turns her head to look at him. The two children, one in a blue tunic and the other in a tan garment, stand close to the woman. The figures are set against a green, grassy ground. The overall impression is one of a sacred or significant union, possibly a betrothal or marriage, under a celestial blessing.",
