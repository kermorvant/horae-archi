    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ, wearing a crown of thorns and with wounds visible, is being lowered. He is supported by an older man with a beard, likely Joseph of Arimathea, who cradles his body. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, leans her head against Christ's arm, her face conveying sorrow, accompanied by another figure, possibly John the Evangelist. On the right, a man in a green tunic and red hood ascends a wooden ladder, assisting in the removal of Christ. The background is a rich tapestry of gold squares interspersed with blue and red, suggesting a divine or symbolic setting rather than a literal architectural space. The ground is depicted as green.",
