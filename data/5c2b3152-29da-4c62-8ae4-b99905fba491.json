    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures are depicted in conversation. The central figure, dressed in a long robe and a hat, is looking towards the right. The figure on the right, also in a robe and head covering, appears to be speaking to the central figure, gesturing with their hands. The figure on the left, in a hooded robe, is looking away and raising one hand. Behind the figures, architectural elements suggest a city or town setting with buildings and arched structures. The scene is framed by decorative architectural motifs at the top.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is not clearly identifiable as a specific biblical or devotional event. It appears to depict a secular conversation or a scene from daily life within a medieval urban context.",
