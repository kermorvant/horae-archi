    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures on horseback approaching a fourth figure standing in a field. The three riders are dressed in medieval attire, with two of them wearing hats. The horses are adorned with decorative trappings. The standing figure, clad in a simple white tunic, is gesturing upwards with an object in their raised hand, appearing to be in distress or supplication. The background shows a landscape with hills and a fence-like structure. The entire scene is framed by ornate architectural borders, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a moment from the life of a saint or a biblical narrative where a person is seeking divine intervention or is being tested. The gesture of the standing figure and the presence of riders could suggest a plea for help, a miraculous event, or a moment of judgment.",
