    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony or service taking place within an architectural setting. In the foreground, several figures in black monastic habits are seated, reading from books. In the middle ground, a table is set with a green and pink cloth, adorned with gold patterns and what appear to be candles. Behind this, a raised bed or altar is visible, draped with blue curtains and topped with a golden structure resembling a reliquary or tabernacle, flanked by crosses. Several figures in clerical attire, including one holding a censer, are attending to this area. Above, angels are depicted, and a rainbow-like arch frames the upper part of the scene, suggesting a divine or heavenly presence. The overall impression is one of solemn ritual and devotion.",
