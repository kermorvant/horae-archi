    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony, likely the Circumcision of Christ, within an interior setting. A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and robes, holds the Christ Child, who is presented on a white cloth draped over a table. A man in a green tunic and a distinctive hat stands behind the table, gesturing with his finger as if speaking or explaining. To the right, a woman in a blue headdress and grey dress holds a basket, and another woman, possibly the Virgin Mary, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. A tall candle burns brightly beside the figures. The background features draped red and blue fabrics, suggesting a domestic or ceremonial space, with a glimpse of a window with diamond-shaped panes. The entire scene is framed by an elaborate border of green, gold, and red elements, with letters visible on the gold scrolls.",
