    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, crowned and with hands clasped in prayer, surrounded by a host of blue-robed figures, likely angels, who flank her on either side. A radiant golden light emanates from behind her, suggesting divine presence or glory. The figures are rendered in a stylized, somewhat flat manner typical of medieval illumination. The overall impression is one of reverence and celestial celebration, likely representing the Assumption or Coronation of the Virgin.",
