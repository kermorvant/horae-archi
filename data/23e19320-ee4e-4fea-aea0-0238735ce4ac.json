    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine vision. At the top, God the Father, enthroned and haloed, holds the crucified Christ. Below them, a radiant emanation descends, illuminating a group of figures. On the left, two men in elaborate turbans and robes are looking upwards, one kneeling. On the right, a woman in a pink robe and a man in a blue robe also gaze skyward. In the background, a rocky landscape transitions to a city with spires and towers. An open book lies on the ground near the kneeling figures. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
