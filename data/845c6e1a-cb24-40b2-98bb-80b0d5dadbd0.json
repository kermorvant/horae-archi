    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed male figures within an architectural setting. The figure on the left, dressed in an orange robe and a green mantle, holds a large key. The figure on the right, wearing a red robe over a black garment, holds a staff topped with a cross or orb. The background features a light blue wall with a brick pattern and a decorative blue tapestry with gold foliage. The scene is framed by an illuminated initial 'D'. This imagery likely represents Saint Peter, identifiable by the keys of heaven, receiving authority or a symbolic object from another saint or biblical figure.",
