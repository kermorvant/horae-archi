    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Circumcision of Christ, with the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus over a golden basin. Joseph, an older man with grey hair, is shown performing the ritual with a knife. Two women attend, one with a white headdress and a golden garment, and another in a red robe. A man in a red robe stands behind Joseph, and another figure in a golden robe is visible on the right. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by arches and columns, with a glimpse of an outdoor landscape through an opening. The floor is tiled, and the overall scene is richly decorated with gold accents.",
