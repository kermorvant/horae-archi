    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures within a circular frame. On the left, a figure with long hair and a beard, possibly female given the exposed breast, holds a smaller figure or object. To the right, two figures, also with long hair and beards, are positioned behind the central figure. The background is filled with stippling, suggesting a celestial or abstract setting. The figures are rendered in a stylized, woodcut-like manner, with emphasis on drapery and facial features. The overall impression is one of an allegorical or symbolic representation rather than a narrative biblical event.",
