    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession carries a deceased, crowned figure on a richly decorated bier through a landscape. The bier is draped with a dark cloth adorned with gold floral motifs, and the deceased wears a crown and regal attire. Several figures in long, flowing robes, some with hoods, bear the bier and walk alongside. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires, including a prominent church with a rose window, is depicted against a blue sky with distant mountains. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded border, suggesting a manuscript illumination.",
