    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Coronation of the Virgin Mary, a significant event in Christian iconography. Christ, seated on a throne and wearing a crown and green mantle, places a crown upon the head of the Virgin Mary, who is kneeling before him. She is adorned with a blue robe and has a halo. Above them, in a celestial realm indicated by a golden, star-filled sky, God the Father blesses the scene, holding a golden orb. Angels surround the central figures, some playing trumpets with flags bearing crosses, others looking on with reverence. The figures are set against a backdrop of a grey, brick-like wall, suggesting an architectural interior, though the upper portion opens to a divine sky. The floor is decorated with a green and gold diamond pattern.",
