    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border with stylized vegetal motifs and what appear to be animalistic or monstrous heads. The central portion features intertwined forms that suggest movement and organic growth, possibly representing vines or foliage. On either side, there are profiles of heads with distinct facial features, including eyes and mouths, framed by what could be hair or headdresses. The overall impression is one of a decorative frieze, likely intended to frame text or an image within a manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image appears to be a decorative border, possibly a historiated initial or a marginalia, rather than a scene with a specific religious or biblical narrative. Its function is likely ornamental and to enhance the visual appeal of the manuscript page.",
