    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts four figures in what appears to be a domestic or workshop setting, framed by ornate golden architectural elements. In the foreground, a person in a blue tunic and white apron, wearing a red cap, holds a long-handled tool with a round object (possibly dough or a loaf) at the end, seemingly preparing to place it into an oven. A small animal, resembling a piglet or a cat, is visible near their feet. Behind this figure, another person in a green tunic and blue hose looks upwards. To the right, a woman in a blue dress and green sleeves, wearing a white headdress, holds a round object, possibly a tray of eggs or small loaves. Another woman in a red and blue garment carries a similar tray on her head. The background shows architectural structures with arches and columns, suggesting an interior space with ovens or hearths.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a domestic activity, possibly the preparation of bread or other baked goods. The presence of a piglet could allude to the sustenance provided by such activities or a broader theme of domestic economy. Without further context or specific iconography, a precise religious or biblical interpretation is difficult, but it could be related to themes of daily life, sustenance, or the provision of food.",
