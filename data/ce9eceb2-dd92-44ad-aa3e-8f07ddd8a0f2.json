    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and with hands clasped in prayer, kneels before the Christ Child, who lies on the ground. A cow and a donkey are present, with the donkey's head visible behind Mary. Several figures surround the child: a man holding a lantern, a woman in an orange garment with hands clasped, and another woman in a green robe reaching towards the child. A small dog stands near Mary. Above, a wooden structure with visible beams and rafters suggests the stable's roof, and a starry blue sky with a crescent moon and birds is visible through an opening. The scene is framed by an arched border with floral motifs.",
