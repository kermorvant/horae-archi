    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bishop in prayer before an altar, with a young acolyte peeking from behind a green curtain. To the right, a depiction of souls in purgatory, some reaching up with clasped hands, are being pulled from the water by an angel. Above them, a figure, possibly God, blesses the scene. A demonic figure is visible in the upper right corner, near the souls in torment. The architectural setting includes vaulted ceilings and columns, suggesting a church interior, with a contrasting open, blue sky on the right side where the souls are being rescued.",
