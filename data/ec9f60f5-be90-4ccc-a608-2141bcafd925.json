    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in a mitre and chasuble, stands holding a crozier. He is depicted with a halo and raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing. To the left, three small figures, possibly children, are shown in a tub, their hands clasped in prayer. The background features a decorative, sunburst-like motif in gold on a red ground, set against a blue sky. The floor is tiled in a green and black checkerboard pattern. This scene likely depicts Saint Nicholas of Myra, known for his miracles, including the resurrection of three boys who were murdered and dismembered.",
