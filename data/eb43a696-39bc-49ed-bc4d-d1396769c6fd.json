    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely a saint or devotional figure, stands before a curtained backdrop adorned with stars. She wears a dark cloak lined with fur or ermine, draped over a lighter garment. Her right hand is placed over her heart, while her left hand holds a chalice containing a heart, from which a flame or blood emanates. To her left, a lectern displays an open book with text. The foreground features a patterned floor. The overall scene suggests a moment of spiritual contemplation or martyrdom, possibly representing Saint Agnes or another virgin martyr, given the iconography of the heart and chalice.",
