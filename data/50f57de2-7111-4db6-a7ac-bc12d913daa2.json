    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in ornate vestments including a mitre and cope, stands centrally, holding a crozier and raising his right hand in blessing. He is surrounded by a group of cherubic, naked figures who are looking up at him with clasped hands in prayer. The scene is set within an architectural interior, suggested by columns and walls, with a hint of a patterned floor.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene depicts a bishop in the act of blessing, likely representing a saint or a figure of spiritual authority. The presence of the naked, praying figures suggests a scene of intercession or a representation of souls seeking divine favor or salvation through the bishop's intercession.",
