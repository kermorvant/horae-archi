    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross at the center. To the left, a bearded man in dark robes holds a chalice. Below him, another figure kneels before an open book. To the right of the cross, a woman in a wimple and dark robes kneels with clasped hands before an open book, and behind her stands a figure wearing a mitre, suggesting a bishop or high-ranking cleric. The background is dark and indistinct, with a suggestion of a rocky or hilly landscape behind the figures.",
