    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a close-up of a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, with a golden halo around her head. She is wearing a blue mantle over a white garment and her hands are clasped in prayer. Her expression is somber, with downcast eyes and a slightly parted mouth. Behind her, a red drapery with gold ornamentation is visible, suggesting an interior setting, possibly a devotional space. The scene is rendered in a typical medieval manuscript style with bold outlines and vibrant colors.",
