    "scene_description_enriched": "A male saint, identified by his halo, stands within an arched frame adorned with foliate motifs. He is depicted in profile, looking towards the right, holding a book in his left hand and a processional cross in his right. He wears a red cloak over a green garment and blue hose. Behind him, a richly patterned blue and gold textile serves as a backdrop. To the right, an open window reveals a landscape with trees, suggesting an outdoor setting beyond the immediate interior. The architectural elements visible include a wooden ceiling with visible beams and a stone structure framing the window.",
