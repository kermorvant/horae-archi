    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, predominantly men with beards and wearing varied headwear, are gathered in an interior space. At the center, a figure seated on a throne-like structure, also bearded and wearing a hat, holds a staff. The figures are dressed in long robes. The architectural setting appears to be a hall or chamber, with patterned flooring and a backdrop of what could be decorative screens or walls with arched motifs at the top. The scene suggests a formal gathering or a moment of judgment or deliberation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a biblical or historical event involving a figure of authority presiding over a council or assembly. Without specific iconographic clues, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact event, but it could represent a scene from the Old Testament, such as a king holding court, or a council of elders.",
