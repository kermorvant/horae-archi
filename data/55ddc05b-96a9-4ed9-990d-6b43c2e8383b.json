    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures looking upwards towards a figure ascending into a sky filled with blue clouds accented with gold. The ascending figure's feet are visible, clad in purple robes. Below, a man with a grey beard and a purple robe, hands clasped in prayer, gazes upward. To his left, a woman in a blue mantle and white veil also prays with clasped hands, looking skyward. Behind her, another woman in a pink mantle and white veil looks up with a similar expression. To the right of the bearded man, a young person with brown hair and a red and gold garment looks upwards. The ground beneath them is a green expanse with red and gold flecks, suggesting a grassy field. The scene is framed by architectural elements on the left and right, appearing as decorative columns or pilasters with gold detailing.",
