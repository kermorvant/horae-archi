    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures are depicted in prayer, with their hands clasped together and their gazes directed upwards. The central figure wears a blue tunic and a cap, while the figure to their right is clad in a white robe with a brown hood, and the figure to their left wears a brown garment. The figures appear to be in an indoor setting, possibly a church or chapel, suggested by the solemnity of their posture and the context of a Book of Hours.",
