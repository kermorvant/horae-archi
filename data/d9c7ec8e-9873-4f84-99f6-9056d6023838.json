On the left, a female figure, likely the Virgin Mary, wears a pale pink robe and an orange undergarment, her hands clasped in prayer. She is crowned and looks towards the male figure. On the right, a male figure, likely Christ, is depicted with a beard, wearing a blue robe and also crowned. He holds a globe in his left hand and gestures with his right. The background is gold, suggesting a divine or important context. The figures are framed by an illuminated initial 'D' with decorative elements.",
