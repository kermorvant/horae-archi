    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a wooden stable structure. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer, gazing downwards. Beside her stands an older man, likely Saint Joseph, also with hands in prayer and a halo. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies in a manger, also with a halo. To the left, a donkey and an ox are visible, their heads turned towards the manger. Behind them, a group of figures, possibly shepherds or soldiers, are looking into the stable from behind a wooden barrier. A star shines brightly in the upper left corner, illuminating the scene. The architectural elements are rudimentary, suggesting a humble setting for the birth of Christ.",
