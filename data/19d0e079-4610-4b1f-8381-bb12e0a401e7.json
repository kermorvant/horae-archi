    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, depicted with a halo and long, light brown hair, is shown from the chest up. He wears a pink outer garment over a green tunic. His left hand holds a golden chalice, which appears to contain a small bird or dragon-like creature. His right hand is raised, with fingers extended, as if in the act of blessing or pouring. The background is a vibrant blue, adorned with gold decorative script and a gold halo around the figure's head. The scene is framed by a golden architectural element, suggesting an archway or niche.",
