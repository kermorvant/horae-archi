    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a group of individuals, likely men, with flowing hair and wearing draped garments. The central figure on the left is looking upwards with a somber expression, his arms crossed. To his right, another figure is shown with hands clasped in prayer, also looking upwards. A third figure is partially visible to the right of the praying individual, also with a serious countenance. The style is that of a woodcut, with bold outlines and hatching to suggest form and shadow. No architectural elements or specific setting are discernible, suggesting a focus on the figures and their emotional state.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of prayer or supplication, possibly depicting individuals mourning or seeking divine intervention. The upward gaze and clasped hands are strong indicators of religious devotion or distress.",
