    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of people gathered indoors, looking upwards with hands clasped in prayer. In the foreground, an elderly man with a long beard and a woman in a dark headdress are prominent. Behind them, a crowd of individuals, both men and women, are visible, their faces turned towards the upper right. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light emanating from it. The setting appears to be within a building with architectural elements such as columns and a patterned ceiling. A book lies open on a decorated table in the foreground. This scene is interpreted as the Descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and Mary, also known as Pentecost.",
