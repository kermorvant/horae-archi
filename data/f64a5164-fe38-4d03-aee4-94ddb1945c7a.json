    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, predominantly men, with one central female figure in a vibrant blue mantle adorned with gold. The figures are gathered, many with hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. Behind them, a dark, architectural structure with gold detailing is visible. Above, a blue cloud formation is depicted, from which rays of light descend, and a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, is shown. The central female figure, likely the Virgin Mary, is kneeling, her face turned upwards in devotion. The overall atmosphere suggests a moment of divine revelation or spiritual communion.",
