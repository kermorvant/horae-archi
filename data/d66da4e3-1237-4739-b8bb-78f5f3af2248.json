    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, stands frontally with a slight turn of the head to the right. The figure is clad in flowing robes and holds a small bird in a chalice-like vessel in their left hand, while their right hand is raised slightly. The background is a decorative pattern of diamonds with smaller diamond shapes within, rendered in dark blue and white. The lower portion of the scene features a tessellated pattern of black and white triangles. The overall presentation suggests a devotional image rather than a narrative scene.",
