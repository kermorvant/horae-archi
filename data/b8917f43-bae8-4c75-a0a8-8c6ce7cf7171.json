    "scene_description_enriched": "Two cherubic figures, rendered in a pale, fleshy tone, flank a heraldic shield. The shield is quartered, with two sections depicting a rampant lion and two sections featuring a castellated tower. The background is a deep blue, densely speckled with gold dots, suggesting a celestial or decorative setting. Above the shield, a dark, disc-like object is suspended by a thick, dark rope, with colorful, feathery appendages extending from behind it. The overall composition is ornate and symbolic, likely representing a coat of arms.",
