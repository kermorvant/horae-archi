    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, draped in a white veil and wimple, gazes downwards with a somber expression. She holds up a white cloth, revealing the face of Christ, depicted with a halo of golden rays emanating from his head. Christ's face is rendered with detailed features, including long, dark, curly hair and a beard. The scene is framed by an architectural element, possibly an arch, on the left, and a stone wall with a crenellated top in the background. Beyond the wall, a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a building with a tower is visible under a pale blue sky. The lower part of the image shows the lower garments of the woman and the feet of a figure kneeling on the ground, suggesting a devotional act.",
