    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her blue robe and halo, touching her pregnant belly. She is accompanied by an older man, likely Saint Joseph, with a long grey beard and a red cloak, leaning on a staff. To her right, Saint Elizabeth, also with a halo and wearing a purple habit, gently touches the Virgin Mary's arm. Behind them, a hilly landscape is dotted with trees, and in the background, a walled city with towers and buildings is visible. The sky is a deep blue with scattered gold stars.",
