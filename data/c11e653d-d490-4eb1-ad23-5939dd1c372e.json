    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large red wings and a halo, enters through an opening in a brick wall, holding a scroll with the inscription \"AVE MARIA\". Rays of golden light emanate from the dove of the Holy Spirit descending from a blue sky. In the center, a vase with lilies stands on a tiled floor. On the right, the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, is seated on a red cushioned chair, her hands clasped in prayer, facing the angel. She is dressed in a pink robe and a blue mantle. Behind her, a green curtain hangs, and a wooden piece of furniture is visible.",
