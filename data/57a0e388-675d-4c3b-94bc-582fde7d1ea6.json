    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely Saint Jerome, is depicted seated on a throne-like chair, wearing a red robe and a wide-brimmed red hat, and reading from an open book placed on a lectern. A halo surrounds the figure's head, indicating sainthood. To the right of the figure, a lion lies on the floor. The scene is set within an architectural space with blue vaulted ceilings and brick walls. An arched opening reveals an outdoor landscape with trees and a path. The floor is decorated with a checkered pattern of blue and light blue squares. The overall scene suggests a scholarly or devotional setting, possibly representing Saint Jerome in his study, a common depiction in medieval art.",
