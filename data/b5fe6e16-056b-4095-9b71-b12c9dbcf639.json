    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowd of people gathers around a circular, multi-tiered structure with arched openings. Within one of these openings, a figure dressed in blue, with hands clasped in prayer, stands amidst flames. Another figure, dressed in a golden robe, appears to be tending the fire with a stick, while others in the crowd look on with varied expressions, some carrying logs. The scene is set outdoors under a blue sky, with a decorative border framing the top left and a stylized depiction of a figure in red on the top right. The architecture is a prominent, reddish-brown structure with a domed roof, featuring decorative circular motifs and vertical elements resembling crenellations or small windows.",
