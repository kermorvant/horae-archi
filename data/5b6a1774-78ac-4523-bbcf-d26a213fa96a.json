    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a fortified city or castle with multiple towers and crenellated walls. Figures are visible on the battlements, some looking out. One tower features a projecting window structure with a gabled roof. The architecture is rendered in a detailed, somewhat stylized manner, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination. The overall impression is one of a defensive structure, possibly representing a city under siege or a significant stronghold.",
