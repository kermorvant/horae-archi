    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures attending to a third figure lying down. The figure on the left, wearing armor and a helmet, appears to be lifting or supporting the central figure. The figure on the right, also wearing a helmet, is leaning over the central figure, possibly attending to them. The central figure is lying on what appears to be a bed or a stretcher, with their head visible. The background is dark and textured, with vertical lines suggesting drapery or a tent-like structure. The overall impression is one of care or perhaps a somber event.",
