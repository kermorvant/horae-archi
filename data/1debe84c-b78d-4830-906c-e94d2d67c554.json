She is shown in a seated or kneeling posture, draped in flowing robes. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a decorative or symbolic space. Above her, an arched architectural element frames the scene, possibly representing a canopy or a stylized architectural setting. The figure's long, wavy hair and serene expression contribute to a devotional atmosphere.",
