    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures are depicted in a devotional scene. In the foreground, two elderly men with beards are prominent. The man on the left wears a golden robe and a blue mantle, holding an open book with musical notation and a large key. He looks upwards with an expression of devotion. The man on the right wears a grey robe and a green mantle, holding a red-bound book. He also looks upwards. Between them and behind them, a younger figure in a red tunic holds a golden chalice and gestures with one hand. Several other figures, mostly with dark hair, are visible in the background, their faces turned upwards. The background is a rich blue with gold floral motifs, suggesting a heavenly or sacred space. The scene is framed by architectural elements on the sides, appearing as columns or pilasters with gold ornamentation.",
