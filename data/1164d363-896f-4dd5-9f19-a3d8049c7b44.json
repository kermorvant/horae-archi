    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, stands on the left, gesturing with his right hand. He wears a blue cope over white vestments. Facing him on the right, a man kneels with his hands clasped in prayer, dressed in a brown tunic and red hose. The scene is set in an outdoor landscape with stylized trees and a pale sky. The bishop's halo suggests his sanctity, and the kneeling man's posture indicates supplication or devotion.",
