    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, crowned and seated, holding the Christ Child on her lap. She is adorned in a blue mantle over an orange robe. Two winged figures, likely angels, flank the central figures. The angel on the left plays a lute, while the angel on the right plays a wind instrument. A white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers above. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that appears to be a domed or vaulted chamber, suggested by the curved walls and decorative frieze. A red canopy hangs above the Virgin and Child. The ground is rendered as a patterned surface with blue, cloud-like forms at the bottom. The overall impression is one of celestial celebration and divine presence.",
