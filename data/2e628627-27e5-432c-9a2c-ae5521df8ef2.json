    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation ceremony, likely the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A robed figure, possibly a priest or high-ranking official, stands behind a table covered with a white cloth, his hands resting on it. He wears a jeweled mitre and ornate robes. To his right, a woman in a blue mantle, identified as the Virgin Mary, holds the Christ Child. Behind her, several figures are present, including a woman with a white head covering and a man in a red tunic. To the right of the Virgin, a young woman in a red dress and green underskirt carries a basket containing two doves, a common offering in the Temple. The background suggests an interior space with a large green curtain and a window with diamond-shaped panes. The floor is tiled.",
