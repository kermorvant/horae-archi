    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man, possibly a king or noble, kneeling in prayer with his hands clasped. He wears a crown and a richly decorated cloak. Above him, a figure, likely Christ, holds a globe surmounted by a cross, symbolizing dominion over the world. The figures are set against a backdrop of architectural elements, including towers and what appear to be buildings with pointed roofs, suggesting an urban or ecclesiastical setting. The overall composition evokes a scene of supplication and divine authority.",
