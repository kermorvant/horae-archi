    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in the foreground, gesturing with his right hand. He wears a red cope over a white alb. To the left, a kneeling figure in a white habit, likely a nun or devout woman, prays with clasped hands. The background depicts a pastoral landscape with rolling green hills, scattered trees, and a distant city with towers and walls under a pale blue sky. The scene likely represents a bishop offering a blessing or intercession to a supplicant.",
