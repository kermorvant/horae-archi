    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed figures, likely saints or martyrs, stand facing forward. They are adorned in elaborate robes, one white with a pattern of black ermine-like markings and the other a patterned fabric. Both figures hold palm fronds, symbols of martyrdom, and books. The background features a decorative, grid-like pattern within an arched frame, suggesting an interior setting or a symbolic representation of a sacred space. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern. The figures' poses and attributes suggest a devotional context, possibly representing saints honored in a Book of Hours.",
