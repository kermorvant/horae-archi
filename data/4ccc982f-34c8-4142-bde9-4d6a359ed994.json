    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures, identified as Saint Peter and Saint Paul, stand within an architectural setting that opens to a landscape. Saint Peter, on the left, wears a papal tiara and vestments, holding a large key and an open book. Saint Paul, on the right, is depicted with a sword and a red cloak over a blue tunic. They are positioned between two large columns, with a glimpse of a house and rolling hills in the background. The scene is framed by an ornamental border typical of Books of Hours.",
