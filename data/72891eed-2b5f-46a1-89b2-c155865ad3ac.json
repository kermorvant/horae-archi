    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ bound and scourged, a representation of the Passion. He is shown with a halo, wearing a crown of thorns, and his torso is bare, revealing wounds and marks of flagellation. His hands are bound in front of him. To his left, a column with a rope tied around it suggests the place of his torment. To his right, a pillar topped with a handle and a whip-like object further emphasizes the instruments of his suffering. The background is simple, with horizontal lines suggesting a wooden structure or platform.",
