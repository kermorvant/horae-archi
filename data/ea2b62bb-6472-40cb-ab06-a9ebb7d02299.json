    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of an elderly man with a long, flowing beard and mustache, wearing a distinctive hat with a pointed crown and a decorative element on top. He is dressed in layered garments, possibly indicating a person of status. His left hand is raised, with fingers extended, as if gesturing or in contemplation. The background is abstract, with heavy hatching suggesting drapery or a curtain, and a curved element that might be part of a larger structure or a symbolic representation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is likely a representation of a prophet or a wise elder, possibly from the Old Testament, given the beard and contemplative pose. Without further context or accompanying text, a specific biblical or devotional interpretation is difficult to ascertain. However, the figure's attire and demeanor suggest wisdom and authority.",
