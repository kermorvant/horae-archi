    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, including the Virgin Mary, kneeling and looking upwards. Behind her, a crowd of men, some with beards and halos, are also looking up. Rays of golden light descend from above, illuminating the scene and converging on the figures. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is visible at the top right, emitting these rays. In the foreground, to the right, a table covered with a red and gold cloth holds an open book. The figures are positioned within an architectural space suggested by a dark, patterned background and a vaulted ceiling indicated by the arched frame of the illumination. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern.",
