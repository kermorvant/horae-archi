    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a woman, is depicted from the chest up, holding a leafy wreath in her left hand. She wears an elaborate headdress with decorative elements and a veil. Her clothing includes a high-necked garment with a scalloped collar and a belted tunic. Her right hand is extended, pointing forward, and she appears to be looking to her left. The style is that of a woodcut illustration, with bold lines and minimal shading. The background is indistinct, suggesting an outdoor or undefined setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's pose and the wreath suggest a symbolic representation, possibly of victory, martyrdom, or a specific saint or allegorical figure. Without further context or identifying attributes, a precise interpretation is difficult. However, the gesture of pointing and the wreath are common iconographic elements.",
