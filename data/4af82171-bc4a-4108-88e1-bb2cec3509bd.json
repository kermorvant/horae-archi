    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, with his disciples Peter, James, and John sleeping nearby. Jesus, in a blue robe, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. The disciples are shown slumped in sleep, one with his head resting on his hand. In the background, a wooden fence encloses a courtyard with a gate, beyond which lies a city with towers and spires. Above, in a celestial sphere, God the Father is depicted, holding a globe and extending a hand, with a chalice on a rocky outcrop in the foreground. The overall scene is set in an outdoor environment with architectural elements in the distance.",
