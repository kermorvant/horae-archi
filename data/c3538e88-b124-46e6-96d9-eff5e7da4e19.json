    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a naked soul, chained and surrounded by demons, in a landscape of rocky outcrops and flames. The soul is reaching out, seemingly in distress or accusation, towards the demons who torment it. One demon, red and horned, holds a staff and points at the soul. Another, blue and with multiple faces, looms behind. A yellow demon crouches to the right. Above, in a radiant halo, a bearded man holds the Christ Child, symbolizing divine intervention or judgment. The overall impression is one of torment and the struggle for salvation.",
