    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble dwelling, framed by an arched border. A nude Christ Child lies on the ground, bathed in a divine light emanating from above. To the left, the Virgin Mary, veiled and with hands clasped in prayer, gazes down at her son. Behind her, Saint Joseph, with a beard and staff, also looks towards the child. To the right, a kneeling figure, possibly a shepherd or a donor, with hands pressed together in devotion, observes the scene. The background suggests a stable or a simple room, with a manger and animals visible through an opening, and a starry sky above.",
