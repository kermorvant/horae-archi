    "scene_description_enriched": "Two crowned female figures stand facing each other. The figure on the left wears a long blue gown with gold trim and holds a processional cross on a staff. A golden chain extends from her waist to a small, yellow dog at her feet. The figure on the right wears a blue mantle over a richly patterned gold and red gown, and holds a black object, possibly a book or a reliquary, with a white feather protruding from it. Both figures have golden halos and elaborate hairstyles. Behind them, a patterned tapestry or drapery is visible, suggesting an indoor setting. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
