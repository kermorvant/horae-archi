    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a landscape setting. On the left, a bearded man wearing a crown and a blue robe with gold embroidery, identified as 'David', is shown adjusting his crown. Beside him are two other men, also crowned and richly dressed. To the right, a winged female figure, partially draped in white cloth, stands before an open doorway of a building. The banner above reads 'Liberum arbitrium', meaning 'Free will'. The building appears to be a small, stylized structure with a blue facade and a visible interior with a framed object. The overall scene suggests a allegorical representation of choice or free will, possibly related to a biblical narrative or moral lesson.",
