    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic gathering of figures, with an angel prominently positioned in the upper center, its wings spread and arms raised. Below the angel, a dense crowd of people, many with beards and wearing crowns or elaborate headwear, are shown with expressions of awe or distress. Some figures are praying with clasped hands. The background is filled with radiating lines suggesting divine light or a celestial event, and stylized representations of winged creatures or cherubim are visible at the top. The overall impression is one of a dramatic, possibly apocalyptic, event.",
