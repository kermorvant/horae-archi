    "scene_description_enriched": "A divine figure, depicted as an elderly man with a long grey beard and wearing a royal blue crown and a red robe adorned with gold, sits on a throne. He holds another crown in his left hand and raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing or authority. Before him kneels a figure, likely the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe with gold detailing, her head bowed and hands clasped in prayer or supplication. The scene is illuminated by golden rays emanating from behind the seated figure, set against a blue and white arched background, suggesting a celestial or divine setting. The overall impression is one of divine revelation or judgment.",
