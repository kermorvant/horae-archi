    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a rocky, outdoor landscape, with some sparse vegetation and trees in the background. The central action involves several men struggling to carry a large wooden cross. Christ, identifiable by his halo, is shown bearing the cross, with a man in a blue robe assisting him. To the left, the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, looks on with sorrow, accompanied by other figures. To the right, a man in a pink tunic carries a basket filled with what appear to be nails or thorns. The surrounding figures, some in military attire with helmets and weapons, and others in more civilian clothing, appear to be a mix of tormentors and onlookers. The overall atmosphere is one of suffering and religious solemnity.",
