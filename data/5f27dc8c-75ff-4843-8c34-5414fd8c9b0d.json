Both are dressed in medieval attire. Behind them, stylized architectural elements suggest a town or city setting with buildings and arches. To the left and right, framed figures are visible within architectural niches. The figure on the left is a woman with a headdress and a halo, while the figure on the right is a man wearing a cap and a cloak, also with a halo. The overall composition is divided into distinct panels by decorative borders.",
