    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures, two of whom are prominently featured. The figure on the right is an elderly man with a long white beard, wearing a white robe and a tall, ornate headdress. He is gesturing with his right hand. To his left, a woman with a veiled head and a dark garment is looking towards the viewer, her expression somber. Behind her, a third figure, likely a man, is partially visible, wearing a dark cap and attire. The background is a plain, dark color, suggesting an indoor or perhaps a metaphysical setting, with no discernible architectural elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "While the specific event is not definitively identifiable without more context, the presence of an elderly, robed figure with a headdress, possibly a priest or a significant religious or civic leader, along with a veiled woman, could suggest a scene from the Old Testament, a saint's life, or a devotional narrative involving figures of authority and piety.",
