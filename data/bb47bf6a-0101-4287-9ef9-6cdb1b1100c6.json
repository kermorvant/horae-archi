    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary tenderly holding the Christ Child. Mary, draped in a vibrant blue mantle with gold trim, gazes down at the infant. The Christ Child, depicted as a nude infant, is held securely in her arms, wrapped partially in white cloth. A golden background, characteristic of divine or heavenly settings, surrounds the figures. The composition is framed by an arched border, suggesting it is an illumination within a manuscript.",
