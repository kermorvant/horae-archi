    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an outdoor pastoral setting with two shepherds and a flying angel. One shepherd, kneeling, looks upwards with hands raised in awe. The other shepherd stands, also looking up, with one arm extended. Between them, a flock of sheep grazes. Above, an angel descends, holding a glowing, serpentine light in its hands, directed towards the shepherds. The landscape is dotted with trees and large, upright stones, suggesting a somewhat wild or ancient terrain. The overall composition is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
