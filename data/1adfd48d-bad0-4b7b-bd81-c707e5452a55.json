To her right, an angel, identifiable by its wings and halo, kneels and gestures with its right hand, its index finger raised. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that includes a large, draped canopy behind the Virgin and an arched structure with decorative elements above. The background suggests an interior space with a window-like opening.",
