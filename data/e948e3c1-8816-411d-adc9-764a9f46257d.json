Another Magus stands behind him, also holding a gift, and a third Magus, depicted with darker skin, stands to the right, presenting his offering. The figures are positioned within a partially enclosed architectural setting, with brick walls and doorways visible. A star shines in the blue sky above, indicating the guiding star of Bethlehem.
