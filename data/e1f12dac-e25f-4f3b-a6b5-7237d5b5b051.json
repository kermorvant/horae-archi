    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two men in a landscape setting. One man stands with a staff, wearing a hat and tunic, while the other kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. Above them, an angel is depicted within a crescent-shaped band inscribed with the Latin phrase \"Gloria in excelsis Deo\" (Glory to God in the highest). The background suggests a hilly terrain with some vegetation. The overall composition evokes a religious narrative, likely the Annunciation to the Shepherds.",
