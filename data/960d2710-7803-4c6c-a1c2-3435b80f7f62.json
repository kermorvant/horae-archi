    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, clad in a purple robe, gesturing with his hands towards a man lying in an open wooden coffin. The man, partially covered by white cloth, is kneeling with his hands clasped in prayer. A crowd of onlookers, some with expressions of astonishment and others with veiled faces, surround Christ. The setting appears to be an interior space with arched openings revealing a landscape beyond. The architecture features decorative arches and columns, with a tiled floor.",
