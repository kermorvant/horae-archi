    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded elder, dressed in a vibrant blue robe with gold trim, stands and points with his right hand towards a golden dragon suspended from a wooden cross-like structure. The dragon is depicted in profile, with its mouth open and its tail curled. Below the elder, two bearded men in brown robes are shown kneeling and looking upwards, their hands clasped in prayer or supplication. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of small red, blue, and white squares with gold accents. Green undulating ground is visible at the bottom, from which white, ribbon-like elements emerge.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the Expulsion of the Dragon, a common motif in Christian iconography, often associated with the triumph of faith over evil or heresy. The elder figure could represent a saint or prophet, possibly Moses raising the serpent in the wilderness (Numbers 21:4-9), which was a prefiguration of Christ's crucifixion and victory over sin and death. The kneeling figures represent believers or supplicants witnessing this divine intervention.",
