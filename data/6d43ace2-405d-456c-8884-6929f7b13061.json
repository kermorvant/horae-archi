    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned man kneeling in prayer in a landscape setting. He wears a red mantle over a blue tunic and a golden crown. His hands are clasped in supplication. Above him, within a blue arched frame, a figure identified as God the Father, with a halo, holds a globe and raises his hand in blessing. He is surrounded by six winged figures, likely angels, depicted in yellow and orange robes. The landscape features a winding river, green hills, and trees. A harp-like object lies on the ground in the foreground. The entire scene is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs and gold accents.",
