    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an arched architectural frame adorned with foliate motifs. On the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe and with hands clasped in prayer, is shown kneeling before a lectern. Behind her, a rich red and gold patterned curtain hangs. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, in a pink robe and with golden wings, kneels and holds a green book. He is shown speaking, with a scroll unfurling from his mouth containing the Latin text 'Ave gratia plena Dominus tecum'. Above Gabriel, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends. A small statue of a standing male figure is visible in a niche above the lectern. In the background, a stylized representation of a building with arched windows is depicted.",
