    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identifiable by his halo and the act of writing in a book, seated on a rocky island. To his left, a bird, likely an eagle, stands attentively. To his right, a black demon is shown attempting to tempt him with a scroll or document, while also being bound by a chain. The background features a river flowing through a landscape dotted with rocky outcrops and lush greenery. In the distance, a city with towers and walls is visible, and boats navigate the river. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, gilded architectural border with foliate motifs.",
