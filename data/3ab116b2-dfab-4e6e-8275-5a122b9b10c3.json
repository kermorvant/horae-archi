    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. Three crowned figures, presumably the Magi, are present. One kneels before a seated Virgin Mary, who cradles the Christ Child. The Virgin Mary is dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold patterns, and the Christ Child is also depicted with a halo. The kneeling figure, dressed in pink, offers a golden chalice. Another figure, a king in a green robe, stands behind the kneeling figure, looking towards the Virgin and Child. A third king, dressed in blue and holding a similar golden chalice, stands to the left. The background is highly decorative, featuring a blue and gold diamond pattern and architectural elements suggesting a stylized interior or canopy.",
