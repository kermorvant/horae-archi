    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine figure, likely God the Father, seated on a throne. He is adorned with a triple crown and a golden robe, and has a long white beard. He points upwards with his right hand, while a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, perches on his left shoulder. The Christ Child sits on his lap, looking upwards. The figures are set against a background of radiant golden light, bordered by blue clouds. Below them, a rainbow arcs over a stylized landscape with buildings. This imagery represents the Holy Trinity, with God the Father, the Holy Spirit (dove), and the Son (Christ Child) depicted together.",
