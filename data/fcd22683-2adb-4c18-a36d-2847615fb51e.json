    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, who is reaching out towards an angel. To the left, a woman in a nun's habit stands, possibly representing Saint Anne or another devout figure. The figures are situated within an interior space, suggested by the tiled floor and the brick wall with a diamond-paned window. A red curtain hangs on the left, and a patterned green textile is visible behind it. An arched opening on the right reveals a landscape with rolling hills and distant fortified buildings. The overall composition suggests a devotional scene, likely depicting a moment of divine visitation or a presentation of the Christ Child.",
