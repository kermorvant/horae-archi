    "scene_description_enriched": "Three identical figures of Christ, each with a halo and dressed in a pink tunic and blue mantle, are seated behind a table. Each figure holds an open book and gestures with one hand. Between them on the table are three chalices. The background features ornate architectural elements with gold leaf, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting. The figures' repetition and the presence of chalices likely allude to the Last Supper and the Eucharist.",
