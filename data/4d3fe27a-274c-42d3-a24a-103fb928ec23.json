    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a Lamb of God standing on a mound, from which a stream flows into a chalice. The Lamb is radiant, suggesting divine presence. Below, a figure, likely John the Baptist, is shown with a halo, holding a vessel and looking towards the Lamb. In the lower left, a group of figures, possibly disciples or onlookers, are partially visible. The background is abstract, with stylized clouds and possibly celestial elements, suggesting a spiritual rather than earthly setting. The overall composition evokes a scene of spiritual significance, likely related to the Eucharist or the sacrifice of Christ.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) is a powerful symbol in Christian iconography, representing Jesus Christ as the sacrificial lamb who takes away the sins of the world. The stream flowing into the chalice alludes to the Eucharist, where Christ's blood is symbolically consumed. The presence of John the Baptist is common in scenes related to Christ's ministry and sacrifice, as he famously proclaimed Jesus as the Lamb of God. The radiant aura around the lamb signifies its divine nature.",
