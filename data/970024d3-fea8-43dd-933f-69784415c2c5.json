    "scene_description_enriched": "A monstrous, grey-skinned demon with clawed feet and a staff stands on a grassy ground, facing a group of men. The demon is depicted in profile, its body hunched and its face turned towards the men. The men, dressed in medieval attire, appear to be recoiling or observing the demon with apprehension. The background behind the demon is a richly patterned tapestry or wall, composed of small squares of red, blue, and gold. The scene is framed by a decorative border, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
