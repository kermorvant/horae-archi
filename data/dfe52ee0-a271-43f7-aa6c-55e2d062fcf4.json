    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts several vignettes. On the left, two figures embrace, wearing caps and cloaks. Above them, a figure in a hooded garment holds a large, curved blade. In the upper right, text in Gothic script is visible. Below the text, a scene shows several figures, one with a beard and wearing a crown, engaged in what appears to be a struggle or conflict, possibly involving a large object being carried. At the bottom, several naked figures are depicted in various poses, some interacting with each other, and others in a more chaotic arrangement, with floral elements present.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The text and imagery suggest a devotional context, likely related to penitential psalms or a contemplation of sin and divine judgment. The figures in the lower scenes could represent humanity in its fallen state, struggling with earthly desires or facing consequences. The upper scene with the crowned figure might allude to a biblical narrative or a representation of earthly power. The overall theme appears to be a reflection on human frailty and the need for divine mercy.",
