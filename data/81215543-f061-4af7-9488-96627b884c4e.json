    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a large wooden ship sailing on a wavy sea under a blue sky with golden rays emanating from above. The ship has a prominent mast with sails, and a multi-tiered structure. Several figures are visible within the ship's structure. In the lower deck, a group of people, including women and men, are looking outwards. In the upper section, there are openings through which white, cloud-like forms are visible, possibly representing animals or divine presence. A bearded man with a red garment and a woman in a blue garment are positioned in the upper right part of the ship's interior. The overall impression is of a journey or a significant event taking place at sea.",
