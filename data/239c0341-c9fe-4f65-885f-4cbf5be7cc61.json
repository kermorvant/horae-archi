    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel, clad in golden armor and a blue tunic adorned with golden fleur-de-lis, engaged in combat with a dark, demonic creature. Saint Michael, with large white wings and a halo, wields a sword raised high in his right hand, while his left hand holds a spear or lance that he is thrusting into the mouth of the demon. The demon is depicted as a grotesque, bat-winged figure with sharp teeth and claws. The background features rolling green hills under a blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The entire scene is framed by a decorative golden border, hinting at its placement within a manuscript.",
