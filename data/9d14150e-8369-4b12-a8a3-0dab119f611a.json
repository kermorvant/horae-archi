    "scene_description_enriched": "A single figure, depicted as a male saint, stands against a blue background adorned with gold fleur-de-lis. He wears a white alb and a red chasuble with gold trim, indicative of liturgical vestments. A gold collar encircles his neck, and a circular clasp fastens the chasuble at the chest. He holds a palm frond, a symbol of martyrdom, in his left hand, and in his right hand, he clutches a small, dark object, possibly representing stones or relics, associated with his martyrdom. His head is bowed, and blood is depicted trickling down his forehead and face, suggesting he has suffered a violent death. The ground beneath him is a vibrant green, rendered with gold lines suggesting grass or a stylized landscape.",
