    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. A woman in a blue mantle, likely the Virgin Mary, presents the infant Christ to an elderly man, possibly Simeon, who holds the child. Behind the Virgin Mary stands a woman in a white veil and green garment, with hands clasped in prayer, perhaps representing Anna or another devout figure. Two other men, one in a red robe and black hood holding a torch, and another in a yellow cap, are also present. The figures are positioned within a grand architectural setting characterized by stone walls, columns, and arched doorways, suggesting a temple or church interior. A decorative emblem is visible above an arched window in the background.",
