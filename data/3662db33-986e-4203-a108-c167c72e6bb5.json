    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identifiable by his halo and the presence of his traditional symbol, the eagle, which is shown holding a lantern in its beak. John is seated outdoors, dressed in a blue tunic and a red mantle, and is shown writing on a scroll. The background features a lush green landscape with rolling hills, a body of water, and a distant city with prominent spires and towers. The eagle stands to the left of John, looking towards him. The overall impression is one of scholarly contemplation and divine inspiration.",
