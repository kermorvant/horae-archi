    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, cradles the body of Christ, who is shown with wounds and a loincloth. To the right, a woman in a red cloak holds a cross, and another woman in a golden gown kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a group of women look on with solemn expressions. The figures are set against a backdrop of richly patterned textiles and architectural elements, including columns and arches, suggesting an interior or a structured setting. A small white dog lies on the floor in the foreground.",
