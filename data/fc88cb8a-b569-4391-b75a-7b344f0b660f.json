    "scene_description_enriched": "A man in a blue tunic and brown hose is depicted operating a large, spoked wheel mechanism. He is leaning forward, gripping a handle attached to a vertical wooden post that supports the wheel. The wheel itself has a wooden rim and spokes, with small, star-like motifs attached to its circumference. The man is positioned on a patch of green ground, rendered with stylized tufts of grass. The scene is bordered by decorative foliate motifs in green and pink, characteristic of manuscript illumination. The overall impression is of a figure engaged in manual labor, possibly related to agricultural or mechanical work, set against a stylized, non-specific background.",
