    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. In the foreground, a man with a halo, dressed in a blue robe, is embraced by another man wearing a green hat and an orange collar. Behind them, two guards in armor, one in blue and green, stand by an arched doorway. To the right, an older man in a blue robe and a turban gestures with his hand while seated, facing a figure partially obscured. The background shows a brick wall and a tiled roof with spires, under a starry blue sky. The scene is framed by a decorative border. This likely represents the Kiss of Judas, a moment from the Passion of Christ where Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus by identifying him with a kiss to the soldiers.",
