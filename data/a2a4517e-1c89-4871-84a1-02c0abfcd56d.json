    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an interior setting, suggested by the presence of architectural elements like a wall and possibly a doorway or archway in the background. In the foreground, three central figures are prominent. On the left, a woman with long hair and a headdress is shown, her hands clasped. To her right, a bearded man wearing a tall, ornate headdress, possibly a bishop's mitre, stands with his hands crossed over his chest. Between them, and slightly to the right, another figure, likely a man, is depicted with his hands clasped with the woman's. He wears a crown or coronet and a cloak adorned with circular motifs. Other figures are visible in the background, their faces partially obscured. The overall impression is one of a formal gathering, possibly a ceremony or a significant event involving these individuals.",
