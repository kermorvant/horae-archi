    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching towards a figure identified as Simeon, an elderly man in an orange robe wearing a crown. To the left, a woman in a yellow robe carries a basket containing three doves, likely an offering. Behind them stand two other figures, one with a beard and a blue cap, and another with a white headdress. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by a colonnade with pointed arches and blue vaulted ceilings, suggesting a sacred or ceremonial space. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern. A hanging lamp is suspended from the ceiling.",
