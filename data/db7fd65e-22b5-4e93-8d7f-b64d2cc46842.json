    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and headdress, is seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child swaddled in a brown and gold cloth. Saint Joseph, dressed in a blue tunic and a red cloak, stands beside them, looking towards the viewer. He wears a brown cap. In the background, a stylized landscape features rolling green hills, a tree, and a distant city with blue buildings and towers. A small, golden statue of a figure in a dynamic pose stands atop a column on a hill in the upper right. The overall impression is one of travel and perhaps a moment of rest during their journey.",
