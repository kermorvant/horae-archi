    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal figure, likely a king, wearing a crown and a richly decorated robe, holding a scepter. He is interacting with a woman who appears to be receiving something from him, possibly a ring or a crown. Two other figures, a young man in a red cap and a younger boy in a blue cap, are also present. The background suggests an interior architectural setting with a patterned wall and a canopy-like structure above. The overall composition suggests a scene of investiture or a significant royal exchange.",
