    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, visibly pregnant and wearing a blue mantle, being greeted by Saint Elizabeth, who is kneeling and wearing a blue habit and a dark veil. Another woman, possibly a servant or attendant, stands behind them to the left, carrying a small box. The figures are set against a backdrop of rolling green hills and a distant cityscape featuring towers and fortified buildings. To the right, a large, multi-story building with a prominent tiled roof and arched windows suggests a domestic or civic setting, with an arched doorway leading into it.",
