    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. To her right, a figure, likely Saint Joseph, also kneels, holding a candle and looking towards the infant Christ lying on the ground. Behind them, a bull and a donkey are visible in a manger, with a young boy looking out from behind the bull. The background shows a blue sky with golden rays descending, suggesting divine light, and green hills. The architectural elements are rudimentary, suggesting a humble setting for the birth of Christ.",
