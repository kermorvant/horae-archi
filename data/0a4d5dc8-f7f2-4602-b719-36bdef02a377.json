    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, is depicted seated on a stone bench, diligently writing on a scroll. The figure is dressed in a flowing robe and appears to be inspired or guided, as a bird, possibly an eagle, stands beside a lectern, also holding a scroll with text. The background is a dark, textured pattern, suggesting a non-specific or spiritual setting. The scene is likely an illustration of the Evangelist's writing, possibly the Book of Revelation.",
