    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identified by his halo and scholarly activity, writing on a scroll. He is seated and appears to be in deep thought. Beside him stands his symbol, an eagle, holding a lamp in its beak. The background is a complex landscape featuring a body of water with several ships, a town with a prominent tower, and rolling hills. The overall composition is framed by an ornamental border, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
