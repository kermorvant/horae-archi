He holds a sprig of white flowers and gestures towards the Virgin Mary, who is kneeling on the right, engrossed in reading a book. Above Gabriel, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The background features a blue, starry sky and a lush green tree on the left, while on the right, a richly decorated architectural structure, possibly a throne or a canopy, is visible. The figures are set against a backdrop that includes architectural elements and a red curtain.",
