    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, holds the Christ Child. Joseph, in a red cloak, stands behind her. To the right, a priest in ornate vestments receives the child, while another figure, possibly Simeon, looks on. Behind the figures, a patterned tapestry hangs, and in the background, architectural elements suggest an interior space with windows. The overall scene is framed by decorative borders typical of a Book of Hours.",
