He is depicted within a Gothic architectural frame. In the background, to the left, a cityscape with towers and buildings is visible, suggesting an urban setting. To the right, another architectural element, possibly a tower or a section of a building, is depicted. The scene is rendered with vibrant colors, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
