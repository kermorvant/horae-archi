    "scene_description_enriched": "Three bearded men are depicted. The central figure, kneeling, wears a hooded robe and clasps his hands in prayer. To his left, another man, also bearded and robed, looks upwards with a solemn expression. To the right of the kneeling figure, a third man, with a long beard and wearing a hooded robe, holds a rosary with a cross pendant, his hands also clasped in prayer. The figures are rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching to indicate drapery and form. No architectural elements or specific setting are visible, suggesting a focus on the devotional act.",
