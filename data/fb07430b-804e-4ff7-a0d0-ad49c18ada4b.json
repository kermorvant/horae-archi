    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Baptist, identifiable by his halo and characteristic attire. He stands in a rocky, outdoor landscape, wearing a rough, brown tunic that is split to reveal his legs. He holds a book in his left arm, upon which a small white lamb is perched. His right index finger points towards the lamb. The background features stylized rocks and a distant, hazy landscape with mountains under a blue sky. The overall impression is one of austerity and wilderness, befitting the saint's ascetic life.",
