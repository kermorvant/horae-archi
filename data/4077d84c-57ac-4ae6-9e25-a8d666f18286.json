    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a youthful figure, possibly a shepherd or a saint, standing in a natural setting with trees. The figure is draped in flowing garments and holds a staff or spear. To the left, a creature, perhaps a lamb or a dog, is partially visible, suggesting a pastoral or allegorical context. The overall style is sketch-like and somewhat indistinct, typical of preparatory drawings or early manuscript illuminations.",
