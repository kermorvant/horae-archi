    "scene_description_enriched": "Two men stand facing each other, engaged in conversation. The man on the left wears a tall, ornate hat with a floral emblem and a long robe adorned with concentric circles. His left hand is raised, gesturing, while his right hand holds a small object, possibly a cup. The man on the right wears a simpler, conical hat and a tunic with puffed sleeves. He holds a similar small object in his right hand. Behind them, architectural elements suggest a structured setting, with what appear to be towers or decorative facades flanking the figures. The overall scene is rendered in a woodcut style, with strong lines and hatching.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a specific biblical or devotional event. It appears to be a secular representation of two individuals, possibly nobles or merchants, in conversation.",
