    "scene_description_enriched": "A young man, identified by the inscription as Saint John the Evangelist, is depicted seated outdoors, with a halo and dressed in a blue tunic and an orange cloak. He is shown writing in an open book with a quill. To his right stands a griffin, a mythical creature, holding a black object in its beak. The background features a lush green landscape with trees, a body of water, and distant mountains under a bright, radiant sun. The scene is framed by ornate architectural elements on the right, including a column and an archway, suggesting a transition between the natural setting and a more structured, possibly divine, space.",
