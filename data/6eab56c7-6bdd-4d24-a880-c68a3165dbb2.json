    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with several figures and sheep. In the foreground, a man plays bagpipes, a woman in a pink dress sits with her hand raised, and a hooded figure stands with a stick. Two sheep are near the woman, and more sheep graze in the background. A man in a blue tunic and red cape dances or gestures with his arms raised. In the distance, a river flows past a rocky hill, and a walled city with towers and red-roofed buildings is visible. Above, an angel descends from a golden sky, holding a scroll with Latin text that reads 'Gloria in excelsis Deo' (Glory to God in the highest). The overall scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
