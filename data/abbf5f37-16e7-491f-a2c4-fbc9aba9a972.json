    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint or scholar, dressed in a red robe and a wide-brimmed red hat, is seated at a desk, reading from an open book. The desk is covered with a blue cloth adorned with gold patterns. On the desk are another open book, a lectern, and a candlestick with a lit candle. Behind the figure, shelves are stocked with books and vials. To the right of the desk, a lion is depicted lying down, with its mouth open. The scene takes place indoors, with a tiled floor and stone walls visible. The overall setting suggests a study or scriptorium, possibly within a religious or scholarly institution.",
