    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in the center, surrounded by the Apostles. The Holy Spirit is shown as a dove descending from a radiant sky, with tongues of fire emanating from it towards the figures below. The figures are all depicted with golden halos, indicating their sanctity. The background is a rich red, and the scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements. The figures are gathered in a somewhat confined space, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a room where the disciples were assembled.",
