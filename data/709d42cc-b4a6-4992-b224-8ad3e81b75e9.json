    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle over a red tunic, kneels in adoration beside the Christ Child lying in a manger. To the left, Saint Joseph, dressed in a red robe and blue scarf, looks on with hands clasped. A golden ox stands behind the manger, its head turned towards the viewer. The architectural setting is a simple stable with a thatched roof and rough stone walls, partially covered by greenery. The background shows a landscape with hills and a pale blue sky, framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
