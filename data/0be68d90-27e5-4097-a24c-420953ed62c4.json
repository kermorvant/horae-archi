    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, identified by the inscription \"mare.\", is depicted in a red robe and pink cap, seated on a stone bench. The figure is actively writing in a large open book placed on a wooden lectern. The setting appears to be an interior space with a blue, gold-patterned tapestry on the left and a pink-walled room on the right. An arched window reveals a glimpse of an outdoor landscape with trees. The overall scene suggests the act of scholarly or religious writing, possibly representing Saint Mark the Evangelist.",
