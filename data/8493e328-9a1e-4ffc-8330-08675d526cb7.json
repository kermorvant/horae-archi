    "scene_description_enriched": "In a lush, green landscape dotted with fruit-bearing trees, Christ stands with his eyes closed and a halo of golden rays around his head. He wears a dark blue robe adorned with gold patterns. His right hand is raised, with index finger extended, and his left hand is open, palm up. Around him, numerous birds populate the sky, trees, and ground. A body of water, teeming with fish and a large, dark creature resembling a whale or sea monster, is visible in the foreground. The scene depicts Christ's dominion over creation, specifically birds and fish, as described in the Genesis creation accounts and the Gospels.",
