    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a pastoral setting, surrounded by sheep and what appear to be dogs. One figure, seated and looking upwards, holds a staff and a bucket. The other figure, standing, points upwards with their index finger. Above them, an angel with outstretched wings descends, holding a scroll with Latin text. The overall composition is framed by decorative foliage and an arched border, suggesting a manuscript illumination. The presence of sheep and the angelic visitation strongly suggest a biblical scene, likely the Annunciation to the Shepherds.",
