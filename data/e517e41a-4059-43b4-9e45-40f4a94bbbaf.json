    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary enthroned, holding the Christ Child. She is crowned and seated on an ornate throne, draped in a blue mantle over a white garment. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is held in her arms. To the left, a kneeling woman in a red dress holds an open book. Above and behind the throne, two winged figures, likely angels, are depicted. One plays a harp, and the other plays a pipe. Two more angels are visible above the throne, holding a banner with Latin inscription. The throne is set on a circular platform with a patterned floor, suggesting an elevated or sacred space. The overall setting is rich and decorative, with architectural elements framing the central figures.",
