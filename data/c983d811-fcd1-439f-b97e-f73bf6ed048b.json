    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. In the foreground, a kneeling figure holds a shallow bowl. Behind this figure, a man with a long beard and a distinctive hat stands, looking towards the viewer. To his right, two other figures are visible, one wearing a cap and the other with a halo-like headdress. The background features stylized architectural elements, including arches and what appear to be crenellated walls or battlements, suggesting a fortified or urban environment. The overall impression is one of a gathering or a moment of presentation within a structured, possibly ceremonial, context.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a scene from the Old Testament, possibly King David in prayer or receiving a petition, given the presence of a kneeling figure presenting a bowl and the regal appearance of the bearded man. The architectural elements could symbolize a palace or a city, reinforcing the royal context.",
