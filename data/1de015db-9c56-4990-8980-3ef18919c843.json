    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures, likely monks or penitents, seated outdoors in a landscape setting. The figure on the left, with a beard and long hair, wears a golden-brown habit and white hose. The figure on the right, with a hood covering their head, wears a reddish-brown habit and white hose. Both figures have their hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a lush green landscape with trees and bushes unfolds, leading to a distant blue landscape with stylized hills and fortified structures. Above, a radiant divine light emanates from a blue celestial sphere, suggesting divine presence or intervention. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element, possibly representing a portal or a decorative border.",
