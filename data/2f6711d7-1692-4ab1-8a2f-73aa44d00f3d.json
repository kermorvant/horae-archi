    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king, depicted with a long beard and halo, sits on a richly adorned throne. He wears a blue robe with gold embellishments and a fur-lined mantle. In his right hand, he holds a sword, and in his left, an arrow. The throne is draped with red fabric, and behind him is a patterned tapestry. The scene is set against a gold background, with a verdant ground line dotted with small white flowers at the bottom. The overall impression is one of royal authority and possibly a depiction of a biblical or historical king.",
