    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, wavy hair and a distinctive headdress adorned with a floral motif and dangling tassels is depicted holding a harp. She wears a garment with a row of circular buttons down the front and decorative bands on the sleeves. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative tracery. Behind her, a simplified architectural structure with vertical elements and a horizontal beam is visible. The overall style suggests a medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a figure associated with music or the arts, possibly a representation of a muse or a saint known for musical talents, or simply a secular scene of entertainment. Without further context or accompanying text, a definitive religious interpretation is not possible, but the presence of a harp could allude to biblical figures like King David, known for his musical abilities.",
