    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in a blue robe lying on the ground, being dragged by a rope held by two other men. The man on the ground has a golden halo, suggesting he is a saint or a holy figure. The two men pulling the rope are dressed in red and blue tunics and wear turbans. Behind them, a building complex is visible, featuring a round tower with a conical roof and adjacent structures with pitched roofs. Another figure, possibly an authority figure, stands on a raised platform to the left, holding a staff and observing the scene. The overall setting appears to be outdoors, with a green, uneven ground surface.",
