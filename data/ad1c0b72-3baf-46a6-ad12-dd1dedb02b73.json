    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a partially enclosed structure. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child on her lap. Before them kneels an elderly man, presumably one of the Magi, offering a bowl. To the right, two other figures, also likely Magi, stand with attendants. One of the Magi wears a distinctive red and blue tunic and a tall, pointed hat, while the other is similarly attired. In the background, a rocky landscape is visible, leading to a distant cityscape with towers and red-tiled roofs. The architectural elements suggest a humble stable or shelter, with exposed wooden beams forming the roof structure and a rough stone wall.",
