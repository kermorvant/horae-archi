    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Jesus Christ, identifiable by his halo and gesture, interacting with a group of people. In the foreground, a man, possibly blind or infirm, is being attended to. He is partially undressed, draped in a white cloth, and looking upwards. Behind him, a figure in a red robe and a green hat kneels, also looking at the central figure. Jesus, in a grey robe, points towards the infirm man, while a crowd of onlookers, including women with veiled heads and men with halos, observe the event. The background features a loggia with classical columns and arches, through which a cityscape with buildings and hills is visible. The overall setting suggests a public or semi-public space within an architectural context.",
