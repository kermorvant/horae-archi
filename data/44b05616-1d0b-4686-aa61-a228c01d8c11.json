Two figures, dressed in red and blue tunics, are actively nailing his hands and feet with hammers. Behind Christ, a man in a golden robe with a blue hat and a long beard stands, gesturing with his hands. To his left, another figure in a green tunic holds a pole with an axe-like weapon. The setting is an outdoor landscape with a hilly terrain and a pale blue sky with some clouds. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
