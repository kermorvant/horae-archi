    "scene_description_enriched": "A red crayfish is depicted in profile, facing left, against a green ground. Above the ground, a blue sky is decorated with gold patterns, including what appear to be stylized nets and possibly leaves or feathers. The entire scene is contained within a circular frame with a black outline.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image appears to be an emblem or a decorative motif rather than a narrative scene from scripture or hagiography. The crayfish, a crustacean, could symbolize various concepts depending on the context of the manuscript, such as the zodiac sign Cancer, or perhaps represent a specific heraldic device or personal emblem. The decorative elements in the sky are abstract and do not clearly point to a specific religious event.",
