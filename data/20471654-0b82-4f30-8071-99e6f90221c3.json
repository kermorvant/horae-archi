    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The body of Christ, crowned with thorns and showing wounds, lies on a pink sarcophagus. He is supported by the Virgin Mary, who is veiled in blue and appears to be weeping, and another female figure in pink. To the left, a figure in red, possibly John the Evangelist, supports Christ's head. To the right, a bearded man in blue, likely Joseph of Arimathea, holds a cloth. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling green hills and distant blue mountains, suggesting an outdoor setting.",
