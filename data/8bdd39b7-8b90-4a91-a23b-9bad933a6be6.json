    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Eve, on the left, with long flowing hair, is reaching towards a tree laden with fruit. Adam, on the right, also with long hair, stands beside her, looking towards her. A serpent, entwined around the tree, appears to be offering fruit to Eve. The background features stylized foliage and architectural elements suggesting a structured, perhaps divine, setting. This scene represents the Fall of Man, a pivotal moment in Christian theology.",
