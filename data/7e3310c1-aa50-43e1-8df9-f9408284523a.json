    "scene_description_enriched": "A young woman with auburn hair, wearing a long, flowing pink gown, stands in a grassy field dotted with small white and red flowers. She holds a large, green, palm-like frond diagonally across her body, resting its base on the ground. Her head is tilted slightly, and her gaze is directed downwards. The background is a clear blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The scene is likely an allegorical representation or a depiction of a saint, possibly Saint Barbara, who is often depicted with a palm frond, a symbol of martyrdom.",
