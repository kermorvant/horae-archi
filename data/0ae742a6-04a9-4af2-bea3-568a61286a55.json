    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Mark seated on a throne-like chair, writing on a lectern. He has a halo, indicating his saintly status, and is dressed in a blue robe over a green tunic. Before him, a lectern holds a manuscript with text. To his left, a green table holds two books, one open and one closed. To his right, a winged lion, the symbol of Saint Mark, lies on a scroll inscribed with 'SCUS MARCUS'. The setting appears to be an interior space with large windows revealing a landscape with rolling hills and birds in the sky. The architecture includes columns and a decorative archway framing the scene.",
