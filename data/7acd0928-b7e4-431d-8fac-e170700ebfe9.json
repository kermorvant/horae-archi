    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine figure, likely God the Father, enthroned within a radiant arch, surrounded by cherubic figures. Below, a man, possibly a prophet or a supplicant, emerges from a rocky cavern, his hands raised in prayer or supplication. The landscape is rugged and hilly, with scattered trees and distant buildings, including a castle-like structure. The divine presence is shown descending rays of light towards the earth, suggesting a communication or intervention.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene appears to represent a divine revelation or a moment of prayer and divine response, possibly related to a prophetic vision or a plea for divine intervention. The figure in the upper register is indicative of God, and the figure below is in a posture of supplication, suggesting a dialogue between the divine and the human.",
