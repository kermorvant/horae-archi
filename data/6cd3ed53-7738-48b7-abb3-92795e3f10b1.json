    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Raising of Lazarus. Christ, with a halo, stands in the center, gesturing towards a emaciated figure emerging from a tomb. This figure, also with a halo, is wrapped in a white shroud and has his hands clasped in prayer. He is kneeling in a grave pit. Behind Christ, a group of disciples and onlookers observe the miracle. To the left, two figures in medieval attire stand near a shovel, one with his hand to his mouth, perhaps in awe or disbelief. In the background, a hilly landscape is dotted with trees and features a prominent castle with towers and a walled enclosure, suggesting a setting outside a town or city. A smaller church-like building is visible in the distance.",
