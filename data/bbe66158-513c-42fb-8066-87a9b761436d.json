    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary kneeling on the left, dressed in a blue robe and holding a book. Facing her is the Angel Gabriel, kneeling on the right, with wings and a red cloak over a white tunic. Gabriel holds a scroll with text, and his hand is raised in a gesture of greeting or pronouncement. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior space, with arched windows and decorative elements. A small portrait of a crowned figure is visible in a niche above the angel. The background features rich textiles and architectural details, creating a devotional setting.",
