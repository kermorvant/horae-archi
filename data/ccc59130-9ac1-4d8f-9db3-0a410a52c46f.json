    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Catherine of Alexandria standing triumphantly over a defeated emperor, likely Maxentius, who lies prostrate beneath her feet. She is crowned and holds a palm frond, symbolizing martyrdom. Behind her, a crowd of onlookers observes, some appearing to be in discussion. In the background, a complex of medieval buildings, including a prominent tower with a dome and smaller turrets, suggests an urban setting. To the right, another group of figures witnesses a blindfolded woman, possibly a convert or a follower, being led away. The overall composition suggests the victory of faith over paganism and tyranny, a common theme in the hagiography of Saint Catherine.",
