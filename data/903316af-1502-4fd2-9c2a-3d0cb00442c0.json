    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an arched frame. On the left, the Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle over a gold-patterned dress and a halo, is seated and engrossed in reading a book, holding a quill. To her right, the Angel Gabriel, clad in a yellow robe and also with a halo, kneels and gestures towards Mary with his right hand, holding a golden staff. Above and between them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light emanating from it. The background features red drapery and blue fabric, suggesting an interior setting, possibly a room or a celestial space.",
