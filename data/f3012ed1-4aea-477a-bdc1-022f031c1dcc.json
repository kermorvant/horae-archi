    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, kneeling and looking downwards with her hands clasped over her abdomen. She is adorned in a golden gown and a blue mantle, with a white veil covering her head. Above her, a radiant halo surrounds her head, and a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a golden sunburst, its wings spread and rays emanating downwards. The background features a dark, textured wall and a decorative frieze with a repeating floral or arabesque pattern in pink and gold. The lower part of the scene shows a green ground with some abstract patterns. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine inspiration or conception.",
