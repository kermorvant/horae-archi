    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of seven men, distinguished by their varied attire and headwear, are depicted in a pastoral landscape. The central figures are elderly men with long beards, dressed in flowing blue and red robes. One man, wearing a blue robe and a red undergarment, has his arm around another elderly man in a blue robe and a reddish-brown cloak. To the left, a man in a blue robe and a fur-trimmed mantle stands with a staff, accompanied by two other figures in red and blue robes and conical hats. To the far right, another man in a reddish-brown cloak and a white cap is visible. The background features stylized green trees and a blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with intricate scrolling patterns.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a biblical or historical event involving a group of elders or important figures. Without specific iconographic cues, a precise interpretation is difficult, but the presence of multiple bearded men in formal attire suggests a council, a meeting of prophets, or a scene from the Old Testament.",
