    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Resurrection of Christ. Christ, with a halo and crown of thorns, emerges from an open sarcophagus, draped in a white cloth. He holds a banner with a cross and an orange flag. His right hand is raised in blessing, and his left hand rests on the sarcophagus. Two figures, likely Roman soldiers, are shown in the foreground, one seated and looking towards Christ, the other kneeling and appearing to sleep. The background is a gold ground with a patterned texture, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting.",
