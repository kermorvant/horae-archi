Below the cross, on the left, stand several grieving women, including the Virgin Mary, draped in blue and gold. On the right, a bearded man, possibly a high priest or a Roman soldier, gestures towards the cross, accompanied by a group of soldiers in armor. In the background, a stylized cityscape with towers and buildings is visible under a bright, radiating sun. The overall setting is an open, green landscape.",
