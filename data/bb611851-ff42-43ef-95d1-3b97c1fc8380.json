    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a heraldic crest featuring a red shield with three dark, stylized heads. Above the shield rests a golden crown adorned with fleur-de-lis and a purple cap. A golden ribbon with an inscription, partially visible as 'NES OF THAIS', curves to the right of the shield. The entire composition is set against a background of delicate floral and foliate decoration, with bluebell-like flowers, red berries, and green leaves intertwined with golden lattice work. This is likely a decorative element from a manuscript, possibly a book of hours, intended to signify ownership or patronage.",
