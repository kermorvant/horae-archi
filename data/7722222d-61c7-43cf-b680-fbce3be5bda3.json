    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth. To his left stands the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle with gold trim, her hands clasped in prayer and her head bowed in sorrow. To his right stands a figure, likely John the Evangelist, in a red and white robe, looking towards Christ. The background is a green landscape with stylized trees and distant buildings, suggesting a setting outside the city walls. The overall scene is rendered with gold leaf accents on the halos and garments, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
