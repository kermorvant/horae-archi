    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funerary or memorial service within an arched architectural setting. Two figures in clerical attire, one in a red robe and the other in blue, stand before a lectern with an open book, seemingly engaged in reading or chanting. In the center, a sarcophagus is draped in blue cloth with a prominent red cross. To the right, two figures in black mourning veils stand with bowed heads, their faces conveying grief. Behind them, an altar is adorned with candles and a golden retable. The background features a richly patterned tapestry or wall covering. The overall atmosphere suggests a solemn religious ceremony, likely a requiem mass or a commemoration of the deceased.",
