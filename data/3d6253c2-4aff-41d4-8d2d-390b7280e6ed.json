    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child. Mary is shown with a halo of stars and rays emanating from behind her head, suggesting divine light. She wears a veil and a patterned garment. The Christ Child is held in her arms, also with a halo. The scene is framed by a circular border with decorative elements, including what appear to be rays of light or flames and some foliage. In the lower left corner, there are dice and a bundle of sticks, possibly symbolic elements. The overall style is that of a woodcut illustration.",
