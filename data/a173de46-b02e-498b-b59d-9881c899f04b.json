    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, a woman in a blue robe, identified as the Virgin Mary, sits with her hands clasped in prayer before an open book on a wooden desk. Behind her is a patterned tapestry. On the right, the Angel Gabriel, with feathered wings and a golden robe, approaches from an arched doorway. He holds a scroll or banner with text, and a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a radiant sky above. The architectural elements suggest a building with stone walls and decorative crenellations, possibly a palace or a grand house. The overall scene is framed by a large arch.",
