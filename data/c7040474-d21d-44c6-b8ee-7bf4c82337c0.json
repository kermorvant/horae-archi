    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies on the ground, radiating light. To the right, the Virgin Mary, veiled and in a grey robe, kneels. To the left, a bearded man, likely Saint Joseph, also in a grey robe, stands. Behind them is a stable structure with a thatched roof, housing a cow and a donkey. In the background, a stylized city with towers and blue roofs is visible on a hill, and rays of light emanate from the sky.",
