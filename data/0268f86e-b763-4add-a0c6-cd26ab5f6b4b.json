    "scene_description_enriched": "A dark-skinned, hairy figure with a beard rides a large, dark, beast-like creature. The rider holds a stick or staff. The creature has a bridle and appears to be walking on green ground. The background is a deep blue with scattered white dots, suggesting stars or a celestial setting. To the left, a fragment of text is visible, along with a stylized architectural element that resembles a column or pillar with a capital. The overall scene is framed by a decorative border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a monstrous or demonic figure, possibly representing a sin, a pagan deity, or a creature from bestiaries, set against a cosmic or otherworldly backdrop. The presence of text and architectural fragments suggests it is an initial or marginalia from a manuscript, possibly illustrating a passage related to temptation, the underworld, or the forces of evil.",
