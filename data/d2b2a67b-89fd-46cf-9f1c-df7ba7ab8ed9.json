    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. Christ, crowned with thorns and bearing wounds, is shown kneeling, his body limp. The Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, cradles his head with her left hand and touches his chest with her right. To Christ's right, a young man, likely John the Evangelist, clasps his hands in prayer and gazes at Christ with a sorrowful expression. Behind them, a wooden cross is visible, and the background is a deep blue adorned with golden stars. The figures are enclosed within an ornate, illuminated initial 'O'.",
