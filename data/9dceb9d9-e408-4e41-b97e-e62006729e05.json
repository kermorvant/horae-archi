    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed woman, likely a saint, stands in a landscape, holding a cylindrical vessel adorned with wavy lines. She wears a long, flowing salmon-colored robe and a white sash. Her hair is braided and falls over her shoulder. The background depicts rolling hills, scattered trees, and a winding path leading towards distant buildings. To the right, rocky formations are visible, with what appear to be small, cave-like structures or rudimentary dwellings carved into them. The overall scene suggests a devotional or hagiographic context, possibly depicting a saint in a natural setting, perhaps associated with a specific miracle or aspect of her life.",
