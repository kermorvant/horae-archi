    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a golden halo and flowing blonde hair, is seated and cradles the Christ Child in her arms. She wears a pink garment beneath a blue mantle. The Christ Child, also with a golden halo, is naked and looks towards the viewer. They are positioned within a structure that appears to be a simple, open-sided building with a grey, stone-like wall behind them. The background is a rich tapestry of gold leaf and colorful floral or gem-like motifs, suggesting a divine or precious setting. The scene is framed by an ornate border featuring red and white patterns and blue decorative elements.",
