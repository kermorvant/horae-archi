    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded men, likely scholars or religious figures, stand within an arched architectural setting. The man on the left, wearing a dark robe and a cap, holds open a large, illuminated manuscript. The man on the right, also in a dark robe, holds a tablet or scroll and appears to be listening or in contemplation. The background reveals architectural elements such as columns, arches, and patterned walls, suggesting an interior space that could be a library, scriptorium, or a part of a religious building. The overall scene evokes an atmosphere of learning and spiritual discourse.",
