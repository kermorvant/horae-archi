The figure is depicted in a dynamic pose, with water flowing downwards. The background within the circle is a vibrant blue, suggesting a celestial or watery realm. The outer frame is dark, with golden, decorative elements that resemble rays or stylized flames. The entire scene is set against a gold leaf background, typical of illuminated manuscripts, with decorative foliage elements at the edges.",
