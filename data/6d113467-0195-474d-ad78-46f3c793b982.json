    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by two figures. Christ, wearing a teal robe and a halo, bears a large wooden cross on his shoulders. To his left, a figure in a pink tunic and green hose, wearing a grey cap, raises a club as if to strike Christ, while holding a shield. To Christ's right, another figure in a blue tunic and grey hose, also wearing a dark band around their head, pulls on a rope attached to the cross. The background is a light blue sky with stylized green trees, suggesting an outdoor setting. The ground is green with some rocky outcrops. This scene illustrates the Passion of Christ, specifically the moment of the Carrying of the Cross.",
