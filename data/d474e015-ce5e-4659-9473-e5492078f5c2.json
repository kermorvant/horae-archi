    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Baptism of Christ. John the Baptist, on the right, pours water from a vessel onto the head of Christ, who stands in the water with his hands clasped in prayer. Both figures have golden halos. Christ is depicted with a white loincloth, while John wears a red robe. The setting is a rocky, outdoor landscape with a single tree on the left and a blue sky in the background. The water is rendered with green and blue brushstrokes, suggesting movement and depth.",
