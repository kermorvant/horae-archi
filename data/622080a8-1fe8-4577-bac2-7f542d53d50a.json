    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary standing on the right, her hands clasped in front of her chest, and a pensive expression on her face. She wears a blue mantle over a red tunic. To the left, the Angel Gabriel kneels, his head tilted upwards, with a red wing visible behind him. He is dressed in a pink robe and his hands are raised as if in supplication or greeting. A scroll unfurls above them, bearing Latin text. The figures are set against a dark background with a repeating gold pattern. The floor is a checkered pattern of black and white squares. Decorative borders frame the scene.",
