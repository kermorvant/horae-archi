    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus centrally positioned on the cross, bleeding from his wounds. To his left stands the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle, with her hands clasped in sorrow. To Christ's right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, is shown with his hand to his forehead, also in grief, holding a book. Two other figures are crucified on crosses on either side of Christ, appearing as thieves. The background is a vibrant blue sky dotted with gold stars, suggesting a celestial or symbolic setting. The ground is rendered in green, with some red foliage at the base of Christ's cross.",
