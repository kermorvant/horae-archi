    "scene_description_enriched": "A detailed illustration of a rabbit is presented within a decorative border. The rabbit is depicted in profile, facing right, with its ears perked up and its body slightly hunched. The background is a simple gradient of blue, suggesting a sky, with a hint of green at the horizon line. The rabbit is rendered with fine lines and shading, indicating a naturalistic approach to its depiction.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is likely a decorative element within a Book of Hours, possibly serving as an initial or a marginal illustration. Rabbits, in medieval symbolism, could represent fertility, innocence, or even Christ's resurrection due to their prolific nature and association with Easter. However, without further context or accompanying text, a specific devotional interpretation is difficult to ascertain.",
