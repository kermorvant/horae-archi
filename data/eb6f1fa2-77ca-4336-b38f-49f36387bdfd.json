    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude figure, possibly a woman, is depicted seated. She has long hair and her body is rendered with hatching lines. She is positioned in front of a background filled with dense foliage, possibly grapes or berries, and what appears to be a draped fabric or a low wall. Her left arm rests on a surface, and her right hand is extended downwards, seemingly interacting with water or a flowing element. The overall impression is of a pastoral or natural setting, possibly alluding to a mythological or allegorical scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too fragmented and lacks clear iconographic markers to definitively interpret a specific religious, biblical, liturgical, or devotional meaning. The nudity and natural setting might suggest a classical mythological figure or an allegorical representation of a virtue or vice, but without further context, a precise interpretation is not possible.",
