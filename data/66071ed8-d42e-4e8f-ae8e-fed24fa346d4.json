    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel, depicted with wings and a halo, descends from a celestial realm indicated by rays of light and a scroll bearing text, towards a pastoral scene. Below, three shepherds are shown in a green, hilly landscape dotted with sheep. One shepherd, seated on the ground, looks upwards in surprise or awe, while another stands and points towards the angel. A third shepherd, also standing, holds a staff. In the background, a town or city with buildings and towers is visible on a distant hill. The scene likely depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a key event in the Nativity narrative.",
