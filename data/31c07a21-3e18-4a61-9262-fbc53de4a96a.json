    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, with a halo and bound by ropes, stands before a column. Two figures, presumably tormentors, are shown on either side, raising whips or scourges to strike him. The background is a grid pattern, suggesting a confined space or a symbolic representation of suffering. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with emphasis on their actions and the narrative.",
