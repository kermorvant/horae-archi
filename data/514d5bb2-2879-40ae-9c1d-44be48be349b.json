    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a trial or judgment within a partially enclosed architectural space. On the left, a robed figure, identified as Pilate, is seated on a throne-like chair, gesturing with his right hand. He wears a blue robe over a white garment and a distinctive green hat. Facing him, Jesus, identifiable by his halo, stands bound by a rope around his wrists, wearing a blue robe. He is flanked by two figures; one in a red tunic and patterned leggings, gesturing emphatically, and another in a red and blue robe with a sword, standing behind Jesus. Behind them, several figures in armor are visible. The background features a blue tapestry with golden star-like motifs and a wall with two small, latticed windows. The scene is framed by a wooden structure above, suggesting a roof or canopy, and decorative floral borders typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
