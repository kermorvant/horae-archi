    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary kneeling on a grassy, flower-filled hillside, her hands clasped in prayer. She is dressed in a blue robe and a grey mantle. Above and to her right, God the Father appears in a radiant burst of light, his right hand raised in blessing and his left hand holding a globe. Behind Mary, a golden wall with crenellations suggests a city or fortification. The background is a deep blue sky, adorned with decorative gold motifs.",
