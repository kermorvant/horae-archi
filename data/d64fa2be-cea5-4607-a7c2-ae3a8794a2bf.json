The lobster is shown horizontally, with its claws extended and its segmented tail curving slightly. The surrounding border of the manuscript page features decorative elements, including floral motifs and abstract blue and gold patterns. This image likely represents the astrological sign of Cancer, often associated with the summer solstice and the month of June in medieval calendars.",
