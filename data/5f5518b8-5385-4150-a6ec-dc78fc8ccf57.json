    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male saint, identified by his halo, stands holding a book in his left arm and a staff in his right hand. He wears a long robe and a cloak draped over his shoulder, with a satchel hanging from his waist. Behind him, to the left, is a stylized representation of a building with arched windows and a cluster of grapes or a pinecone. To the right, another building with arched windows is visible. The lower part of the scene depicts a body of water with a small animal, possibly a dog or a lion, lying at the saint's feet. The overall composition suggests a saintly figure in a landscape setting with architectural elements.",
