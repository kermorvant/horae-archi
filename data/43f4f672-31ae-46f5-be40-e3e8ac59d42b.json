    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, looking down at the Christ Child who sits before her. The Christ Child is depicted as a small infant, also with a halo. To the left, a woman in a red dress and white veil stands with her hands joined in prayer. To the right, an older man, possibly Saint Joseph, with a beard and wearing a green robe and red hood, sits with his head in his hand, leaning on a staff. Above them, the heads of a donkey and an ox are visible within the stable structure. Golden rays emanate from above, suggesting divine light. The architectural setting is a simple stable with a thatched roof.",
