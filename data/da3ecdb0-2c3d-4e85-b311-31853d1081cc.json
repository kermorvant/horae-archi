    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Baptism of Christ in the Jordan River. Christ, a nude figure with a halo, stands in swirling water, receiving a baptismal stream from John the Baptist, who is robed in pink and has a long beard. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a figure of God the Father, who is depicted in red and points with his finger. To the left of Christ, three figures with halos are visible: two appear to be angels with wings, one in blue and the other in grey, and a third figure in red, possibly another angel or a saint. The background is a dark blue, stylized foliage pattern, with a rocky, green landscape with trees on the right side. The overall composition suggests a divine and sacred event.",
