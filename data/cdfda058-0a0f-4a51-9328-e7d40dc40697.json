    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned figure, likely King David, kneeling in prayer outdoors. He wears a royal mantle over a blue tunic and has a beard and crown. His hands are clasped in supplication, and his gaze is directed upwards towards a divine light emanating from the sky. In the foreground, a golden harp rests on the ground, with a red cap beside it. The background features a winding path leading towards a walled city with towers and spires. Rolling green hills dotted with trees and stylized rock formations complete the landscape. The overall impression is one of devotion and contemplation within a stylized, somewhat idealized medieval setting.",
