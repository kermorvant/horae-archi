    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures are depicted in an outdoor setting. On the left, two figures, one draped in red and the other in blue, stand close together. The figure in blue has her arms crossed. To the right, a third figure, dressed in orange, gestures with her hands, palms facing outwards, as if speaking or pleading. A blue sign with gold lettering \"PLVSVLA\" hangs from a stand on the left. The ground is depicted as a grassy field with some distant, indistinct structures. Text labels \"INI OVITAS\" and \"CALVINIA\" are visible.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a moment from classical history or mythology, possibly related to the Roman Republic, given the Latin inscriptions. The figures and their gestures suggest a narrative of dialogue or confrontation. Without further context or clearer iconography, a specific biblical or devotional interpretation is not possible.",
