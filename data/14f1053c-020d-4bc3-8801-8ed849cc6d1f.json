    "scene_description_enriched": "The left panel depicts a bearded man, labeled 'David', kneeling in prayer before a grand arched gateway. He wears a royal blue robe adorned with gold fleur-de-lis and a fur-lined mantle. A harp lies at his feet, and a basket of red flowers is placed beside him. Behind him, a fortified building with multiple towers and spires rises, suggesting a castle or city. The right panel shows a young man in ornate golden armor, pierced by arrows, standing in a lush green forest. He holds a long staff or spear. The scene is divided, with the architectural setting on the left and a natural landscape on the right, suggesting a narrative split or contrast.",
