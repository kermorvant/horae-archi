    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a gathering of figures, all with golden halos, suggesting they are saints or apostles. In the center, a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, dressed in blue and orange robes. Around her, men are also depicted in prayer, some holding books or scrolls. Above them, a dove with outstretched wings, representing the Holy Spirit, descends, with rays of light emanating from it. The figures are arranged in a somewhat crowded manner, seated on a tiled floor. Decorative floral motifs and foliage are visible at the top of the image, framing the scene.",
