    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a devotional gathering within an architectural setting that suggests a chapel or oratory. In the foreground, a man kneels in prayer, his hands clasped, wearing a pink robe and a black pouch at his waist. Beside him, a woman in a pink gown and a blue headdress also prays with clasped hands. To the right, another woman in an orange robe stands, her hands raised. Behind them, a group of men and boys, some kneeling and some standing, look towards the central focus of the scene. The background features an altar draped with a blue cloth adorned with a golden pattern, upon which rests a golden monstrance containing a sacred relic. The architectural space is characterized by a vaulted blue ceiling with golden ribs, large windows with tracery, and pink walls. The overall atmosphere is one of reverence and adoration.",
