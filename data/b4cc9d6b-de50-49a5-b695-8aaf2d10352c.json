    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, some with beards and wearing blue and pink robes, look upwards with hands clasped in prayer or supplication towards a large, bearded figure in a blue robe. This figure, with a golden halo, is reaching down to assist a smaller, nude figure who is being lowered onto a wooden cross. The scene is set against a backdrop of a patterned mosaic-like wall and a starry blue sky. In the foreground, an open book with illegible text lies on the ground, partially covered by the cross.",
