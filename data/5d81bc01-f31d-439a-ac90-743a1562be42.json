    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border featuring a repeating pattern of circular motifs interspersed with stylized floral or rosette elements. In the center, a grotesque or monstrous head is depicted, with a coiled horn or ear, a prominent nose, and an open mouth. The overall style suggests a woodcut or engraving, likely intended as an ornamental element within a larger manuscript or printed book.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is purely decorative and does not depict a specific religious, biblical, liturgical, or devotional scene. The grotesque head is a common motif in medieval art, often used for decorative purposes or to represent the monstrous or chaotic, contrasting with the divine order.",
