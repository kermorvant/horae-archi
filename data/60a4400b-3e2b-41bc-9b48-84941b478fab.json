    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Last Judgment. Christ, with wounds visible on his body, is seated on a throne in the sky, surrounded by clouds. Two angels with trumpets are positioned on either side of him, blowing the instruments. Below, on a barren landscape, figures are emerging from graves, some in agony and despair, while others are being judged. To the left, a robed figure, possibly a saint or a supplicant, kneels with hands clasped in prayer. To the right, a bearded man, also kneeling and with hands clasped, appears to be interceding or praying. The overall atmosphere is one of divine judgment and the resurrection of the dead.",
