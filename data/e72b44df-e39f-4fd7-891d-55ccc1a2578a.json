    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with three shepherds and several sheep. One shepherd kneels in prayer, looking upwards, while another sits with his hands raised in supplication. A third shepherd stands behind them, also looking upwards. Above them, an angel with blue wings hovers within a golden oval, bearing a scroll with the inscription \"GLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO\". In the background, a city with towers and buildings is visible. The overall scene is framed by decorative architectural elements, suggesting a divine revelation to the shepherds.",
