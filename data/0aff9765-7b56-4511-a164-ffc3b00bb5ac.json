    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a simple wooden stable. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, cradles the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child, with a halo, reaches towards an open golden box presented by one of the Magi. This Magus, an older man with a long white beard, kneels before them, wearing a pink robe and a blue mantle. Behind him, two other Magi, identified by their crowns and regal attire, stand. One, in an orange robe, holds a golden vessel and points upwards, possibly towards the Star of Bethlehem visible in the deep blue sky. The other, in a green patterned robe, also holds a golden vessel. A cow and a donkey are visible in the background within the stable structure. The ground is rendered with green grass.",
