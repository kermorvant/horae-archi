    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man, likely Christ, seated at a wooden desk, writing on a parchment. He wears a pink robe and a blue mantle, and has a golden halo. To his left, a winged lion, a symbol of Saint Mark, is seated. Behind them, a large window with three columns reveals a landscape with rolling green hills and a blue sky dotted with dark shapes that could represent clouds or birds. The overall setting appears to be an interior space with architectural elements suggesting a room or study.",
