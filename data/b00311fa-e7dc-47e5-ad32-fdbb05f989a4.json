    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowd of women, many with halos, are depicted. In the foreground, a central figure, possibly a saint or a devout woman, holds a green book adorned with gold floral motifs. She is draped in a golden cloak over a dark garment. To her left, another woman clasps her hands in prayer, wearing a green robe. The background suggests an architectural setting with plain walls and arched openings, possibly indicating a church or a hall. The overall impression is one of devotion and community, likely within a religious context.",
