    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male figure, identified as Saint Jude Thaddeus by his attributes, stands centrally, holding an open book in his left hand and a long spear in his right. He wears a halo, indicating his sainthood, and is draped in a flowing robe. Behind him, a landscape unfolds with stylized trees and a distant town featuring buildings with towers and spires, suggesting a medieval urban setting. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling a decorative archway supported by columns, with ornamental spheres at the top. The overall depiction is characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination, likely illustrating a devotional text or a saint's life.",
