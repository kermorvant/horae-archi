    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a female saint, identifiable by her halo, holding an open book and a white staff with a red tip. She is dressed in a blue tunic and a golden-brown mantle. To her left, a figure in a pink garment holds a small, brown, demonic-looking creature suspended by a white cord, which is being struck by the staff held by the saint. In the background, a walled city with towers and buildings is visible, suggesting an urban setting. To the right of the saint, a lush green bush with red berries and golden accents is depicted. The overall scene suggests a narrative of spiritual triumph over evil.",
