    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, possibly a saint or a bishop, stands in a blue robe over a white tunic, holding a book and a staff. The figure wears a distinctive headdress. The scene is framed by architectural elements, suggesting an interior or a partially enclosed space. In the background, architectural structures with arches and walls are visible, along with a green grassy area and a black railing.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's attire and the book suggest a religious context, possibly representing a saint, a bishop, or a scholar of religious texts. The staff could be a crozier or a symbol of authority. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or devotional scene cannot be definitively identified.",
