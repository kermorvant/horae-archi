    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint or religious figure, stands in a white habit, holding an open book on a red and gold stand. The figure's left hand is raised, palm outward, in a gesture of blessing or speech. Behind the figure is a decorative tapestry-like background composed of small, repeating squares in gold, blue, and brown. To the upper right, a shield with a heraldic device is visible. The lower portion of the scene depicts a grassy landscape with small yellow flowers, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall impression is one of piety and scholarly devotion.",
