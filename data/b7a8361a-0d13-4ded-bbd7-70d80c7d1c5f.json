    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession outdoors, with a central figure, presumably Christ, being led by a man in a green tunic. Christ is dressed in a purple robe and has his hands bound. He is being approached by a figure in an orange tunic who is kneeling and reaching out to him. Behind Christ, a man in a red tunic appears to be speaking to him. A group of soldiers in armor and helmets follow, carrying spears and other weapons. In the background, a town with buildings and a church spire is visible under a blue sky. The overall impression is one of arrest or condemnation.",
