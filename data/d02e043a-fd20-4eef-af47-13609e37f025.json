    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women holding a nude infant. The woman on the left, veiled in white and draped in a teal cloak over an orange garment, cradles the child. The woman on the right, with long blonde hair and wearing a blue robe, also supports the infant. Both women and the child have golden halos radiating light. The background is a solid red, bordered by decorative gold elements. The style is characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination, with stylized figures and a focus on symbolic representation rather than naturalistic detail.",
