    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a richly decorated architectural setting. The Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, tenderly holds the Christ Child. Three Magi approach, offering gifts. The first Magi, wearing a red cap and green robe, holds a golden chalice. The second Magi, with dark skin and a blue and orange headdress, carries a similar vessel. The third Magi, an elderly man with white hair, kneels and presents a golden orb. The background features a gold leaf sky with a distant landscape of hills and trees, suggesting an outdoor setting beyond the immediate architectural enclosure. The foreground is framed by ornate, dark brown architectural elements with golden tracery, resembling a balcony or loggia.",
