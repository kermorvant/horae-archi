To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in blue, is supported by another woman in red, both appearing distressed. To the right, a figure in a red robe, possibly Saint John the Evangelist, holds a book and gestures towards the cross. In the background, a rocky landscape is visible, with a fortified building resembling a castle or walled city in the distance. The scene is framed by a decorative golden border.",
