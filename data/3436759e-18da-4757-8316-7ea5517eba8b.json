    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts two nude figures, a male and a female, standing in a grassy landscape against a blue background. They are positioned close to each other, with their arms extended outwards. The male figure is on the left, and the female figure is on the right. The scene is framed by an ornate, quatrefoil-shaped border with gold accents, and decorative foliage in red, blue, and gold adorns the upper part of the frame. This imagery likely represents Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before the Fall.",
