    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned woman, depicted with a halo, kneels on a blue patterned cushion. She wears a pink mantle over a blue tunic and holds a sword in her right hand. Her left hand rests on an open book displayed on a golden lectern. The background features a dark, curtain-like element on the left and a richly decorated architectural structure on the right, suggesting an interior setting. The scene likely depicts a saintly queen, possibly Saint Margaret of Antioch, known for her martyrdom and association with a sword.",
