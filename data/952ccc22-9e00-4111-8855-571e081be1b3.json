    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a standing nude figure, likely a male, draped with a cloth around the waist. The figure is rendered in a sketchy, dark outline with gold leaf accents, suggesting a devotional or allegorical representation. Behind the figure, architectural elements are visible, including what appears to be a patterned screen or wall with diamond shapes and decorative motifs, possibly indicating an interior setting or a symbolic representation of a sacred space. The overall impression is one of austerity and spiritual focus.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The nude figure, possibly representing Adam before the Fall or a penitent sinner, is a common motif in medieval art. The architectural elements, though abstract, could symbolize a divine presence or a sacred enclosure. Without further context, a definitive interpretation is challenging, but it likely relates to themes of creation, sin, or redemption.",
