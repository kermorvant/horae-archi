    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, identified as Saint Margaret, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, holding a cross. She is seated on the back of a large, scaly dragon, which appears to be subdued. The dragon's head is turned towards the saint, and it is draped with a cloth. Behind the figures, an architectural setting is depicted with ornate walls featuring fleur-de-lis motifs and decorative patterns. Above these walls, arched windows with tracery are visible, suggesting an interior space with a view to the outside or a representation of a building's upper level. The overall scene suggests a moment of triumph over evil, with the saint's faith overcoming the monstrous dragon.",
