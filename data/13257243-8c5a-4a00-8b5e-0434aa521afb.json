    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ's body, marked with wounds, is being carefully lowered by two men. One man, wearing a yellow tunic, is on a ladder, supporting Christ's torso. Another man, in a red tunic and hat, supports Christ's legs. Below them, three women mourn. One woman in a blue robe kneels, her head bowed, while two others in red stand behind her, one with her hand on the kneeling woman's shoulder. In the background, a green landscape is dotted with foliage, and in the distance, several buildings with spires suggest a town or city. The overall scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
