The angel, with large feathered wings and a halo, points upwards and holds a scroll. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a red cloak. The Virgin Mary, also with a halo, wears a blue robe over a red garment and has her hands clasped in front of her chest. Both figures stand against a gold background, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting. The architectural elements framing the scene consist of two pink columns and a decorative arch with blue and gold patterns, suggesting a stylized representation of a sacred space.",
