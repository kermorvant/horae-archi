    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude woman stands in a body of water, her long blonde hair cascading down her back. To the left, a king wearing a crown and ermine-trimmed robe is visible through an open window of a stone building with a red-tiled roof. The background depicts a landscape with rolling green hills, trees, and a distant city. To the right, a tall, reddish-brown tower-like structure with an open top stands amidst the greenery. The scene likely represents Bathsheba bathing, as observed by King David.",
