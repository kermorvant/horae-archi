    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a dramatic and violent event. On the left, a bearded man wearing a blue robe and a green, jeweled hat sits on a wooden throne. He points with his right hand, holding a small, red object, possibly a piece of flesh. In the center, a woman in a red dress and white veil holds a naked infant. The infant appears to be wounded, with blood visible on its chest. A soldier in blue armor and a green tunic stands behind the woman, holding a large sword raised above the infant, poised to strike. The background is a red tapestry with a gold geometric pattern. The floor is tiled in a green and black checkerboard pattern. The scene is framed by an arched border with floral motifs.",
