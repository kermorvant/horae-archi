    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central female figure who is holding an open book. The figures, including the central woman and several men surrounding her, are shown with their hands clasped in prayer or raised in supplication. Above them, two doves are depicted, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The background features architectural elements, specifically a stylized representation of a building with arched openings and decorative pinnacles, suggesting a sacred or significant location. This imagery strongly suggests the Pentecost event, where the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and Mary.",
