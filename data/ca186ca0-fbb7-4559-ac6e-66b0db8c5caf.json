    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in a verdant, grassy setting against a richly patterned background of red, blue, and gold. On the right, a figure with a golden halo, dressed in a blue robe with gold trim, holds open a book and appears to be reading or teaching. To the left, two older men, one in a blue robe and the other in a pinkish robe, are engaged with the figure holding the book. The man in blue leans on a staff, while the man in pink gestures towards the book. The overall impression is one of instruction or discourse, possibly within a spiritual context given the halo.",
