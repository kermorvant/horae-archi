    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his head bowed and wearing a crown of thorns. Blood drips from his wounds. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, stands with her hands clasped in prayer, accompanied by another female figure, likely Mary Magdalene, in a red robe. To the right, a group of soldiers in armor and helmets stand, one of whom holds a spear and appears to be offering vinegar or gall to Christ. In the background, a walled city with towers and buildings is visible, set against a hilly landscape under a blue sky with a crescent moon. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
