    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo, gesturing towards a woman kneeling before him. She is dressed in white and appears to be reaching out to him. To Christ's right, a group of figures stands, including a man in a golden robe and black hat, and others in blue and red garments. Behind them, a building with a rounded tower and red-tiled roofs is visible. The kneeling woman is being assisted by an older man in a red and blue robe, who is holding her hands. The overall setting suggests an outdoor scene in front of an architectural structure.",
