    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures are gathered, with a central figure wearing a crown and holding a book. To her left, a figure in a blue robe adorned with gold crosses and fleur-de-lis stands. To her right, a figure in a pink robe with gold embellishments and a bishop's mitre is visible. Behind them, other figures are partially obscured, one wearing a green headdress. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element and set against a blue sky with a suggestion of landscape or water at the bottom. The overall impression is one of a significant gathering, possibly a royal or religious audience.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of a crowned figure, a bishop, and a figure in blue with religious symbols suggests a scene of religious or royal significance. Without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific biblical event, but it could represent a council, a royal presentation to a religious authority, or a scene from the lives of saints or royalty with religious connections.",
