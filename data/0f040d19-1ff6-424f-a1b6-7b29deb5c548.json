    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a solemn procession or presentation. On the left, a figure in a teal robe with a golden halo is being led forward. He is flanked by two guards or attendants; one on his left wears a pink tunic with green hose and a golden shield-like object on his back, and the other on his right wears a blue tunic and holds the central figure's arm. To the right, a crowned king, dressed in a royal robe trimmed with ermine, extends his hand towards the central figure, seemingly in a gesture of reception or judgment. The background is a muted green wall with faint white grid lines, suggesting an interior space, possibly a hall or chamber. The overall impression is one of formality and perhaps a significant encounter.",
