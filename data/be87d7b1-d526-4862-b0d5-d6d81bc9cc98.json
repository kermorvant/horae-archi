    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated on a white donkey, cradling the Christ Child, who also has a halo. The Christ Child is swaddled and appears to be sleeping. To the right of the donkey, a man, presumably Saint Joseph, walks alongside, dressed in an orange tunic and yellow hose, also wearing a golden halo. He appears to be leading the donkey. The background is a decorative pattern of interlocking squares in red and gold, suggesting an interior or a stylized representation of a setting. The ground beneath the donkey and Saint Joseph is depicted as green, indicating an outdoor or transitional space. The overall impression is one of a peaceful journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or a similar pilgrimage.",
