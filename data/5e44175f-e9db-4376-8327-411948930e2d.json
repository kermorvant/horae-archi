    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity in a \"Throne of Grace\" composition. God the Father, depicted as an elderly man with a beard and halo, sits on a stone throne, holding the crucified Christ. The Holy Spirit is represented by a dove flying towards God the Father's head. Christ is shown on the cross, with his body appearing lifeless. The background is a dark, decorative pattern of swirling foliage. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with emphasis on symbolic representation rather than naturalism. The overall impression is one of solemnity and divine authority.",
