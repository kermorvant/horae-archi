    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ. Jesus is shown on the cross, with blood dripping from his wounds. To his left, the Virgin Mary, draped in blue, is supported by a figure in red, likely John the Evangelist. To the right of the cross, a man in blue and green attire kneels, holding tongs and appearing to hammer a nail into Christ's hand. A ladder leans against the cross, suggesting the ongoing process of crucifixion. The background is a rich red tapestry with gold decorative motifs, and the ground is green.",
