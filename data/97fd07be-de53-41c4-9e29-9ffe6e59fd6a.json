    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures against a gold background, framed by an architectural element suggestive of a canopy or niche. On the left, a man in a blue robe and green cap holds a basket containing a lamb. In the center, the Virgin Mary, in a red robe and blue veil, holds the Christ Child. The Christ Child, with a halo, reaches out his hand. On the right, an older man with a beard, wearing a white robe, holds the Christ Child's feet and appears to be presenting him. The figures are positioned in front of a patterned textile draped over a raised platform, suggesting an altar or a ceremonial setting. The overall composition is framed by decorative architectural elements at the top.",
