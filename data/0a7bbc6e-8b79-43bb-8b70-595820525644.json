    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a domestic interior with a large hearth where food is being cooked. Two figures are present. On the left, a person with curly brown hair, wearing a blue tunic and a gold-trimmed shawl, holds a pot and appears to be tending to the fire or cooking process. On the right, a person with a white head covering, also in a blue tunic, leans forward, observing the cooking. The hearth is active with flames, and a pot hangs over the fire, while meat is roasting on a spit. The architectural setting suggests a kitchen or a similar functional space within a house.",
