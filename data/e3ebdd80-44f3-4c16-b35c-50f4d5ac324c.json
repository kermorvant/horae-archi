    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man with long, dark hair and a halo is seated behind a desk, writing on a scroll. He wears a red cloak over a blue garment. To his right, a carved wooden figure with a halo and a grotesque face is visible. The scene appears to be set within an interior space, suggested by the architectural elements behind the figures, including what looks like a patterned wall or screen. The overall impression is of a scholar or scribe at work, possibly a biblical figure or saint engaged in writing.",
