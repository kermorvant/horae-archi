    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely a saint, stands in a landscape, holding an open book in his left hand and a grid-like object in his right. He wears a golden robe with red decorative patterns over a white tunic and blue collar. Behind him, to the left, are two towers of a fortified building complex, one with a conical roof and the other with a pitched roof and a weather vane. The landscape features rolling green hills, scattered trees with gold-flecked foliage, and a winding path. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
