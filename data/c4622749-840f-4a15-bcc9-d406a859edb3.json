    "scene_description_enriched": "Two nude figures, a man and a woman, stand facing each other, their hands clasped over a large, golden, shield-like object. Both figures have fair skin and are depicted with rudimentary features. The man has curly blond hair and the woman has long, flowing blond hair. They are both covered from the waist down with what appears to be fur or foliage, suggesting a primal state. The background is a dark, textured brown, and the figures stand on a light blue ground. The entire scene is framed by a decorative gold border.",
