    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, meeting Elizabeth, who is wearing a red outer garment and a white veil. Elizabeth embraces Mary, who appears to be pregnant. Both women have halos, indicating their sanctity. Above them, a representation of God the Father is visible within a blue celestial sphere, with rays of light descending. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, sparse trees, and a green, woven fence-like structure in the foreground. The overall composition is framed by an ornamental border typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
