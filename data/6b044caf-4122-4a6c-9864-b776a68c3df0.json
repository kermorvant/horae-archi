    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, bound to a column and bleeding from numerous wounds, stands at the center. He is surrounded by four tormentors. One man in a red tunic and green hose holds a whip, while another in a blue tunic and red hose raises a club to strike. A third figure, also in blue and red, is being held down on the ground by a tormentor in red and green who is pulling his leg. A fourth tormentor, in blue and red, stands behind Christ, holding a rod. The background features draped red and blue textiles, suggesting a makeshift setting, possibly within a courtyard or a hall. The architectural elements visible are limited to a column to which Christ is bound and a suggestion of an arched structure in the background.",
