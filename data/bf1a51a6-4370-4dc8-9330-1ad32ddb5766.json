    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a single figure, likely a man, standing within a rectangular frame. He wears a cap that covers his ears and has a rounded top. His face is rendered with a furrowed brow and a somewhat grim expression. His arms are crossed over his chest, and his hands are clasped. He is holding a piece of fabric or drapery in his left hand, which falls in folds around his lower body. The lower part of the frame contains decorative floral elements. The style is a woodcut or wood engraving, characterized by bold lines and hatching for shading.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image appears to be a devotional or allegorical representation. Without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific biblical event. However, the posture of crossed arms and the solemn expression could suggest contemplation, penitence, or perhaps a figure of authority or wisdom. The floral elements at the bottom might symbolize nature, purity, or a garden setting, common in devotional imagery.",
