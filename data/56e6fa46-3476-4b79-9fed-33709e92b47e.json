    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures engaged in harvesting a field of grain. In the foreground left, a figure is bent over, seemingly resting or gathering harvested crops. In the center, a figure wearing a hat is actively cutting the grain with a sickle. To the right, another figure, also wearing a head covering, is partially visible amidst the tall stalks of grain. In the background, a stylized landscape with hills and what appears to be a distant building or castle is rendered. The overall impression is one of agricultural labor during harvest season. This scene likely represents the month of August or the Laborers of the Vineyard parable, symbolizing the cycle of work and harvest.",
