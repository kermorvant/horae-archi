    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by several figures. Christ, with a halo and crown of thorns, is burdened by a large wooden cross. He is being prodded by two men in armor and helmets, one of whom appears to be striking him. Another man in blue and a pink hat walks beside him, holding a rope. To the right, a woman in red and green, possibly Veronica, kneels and holds a cloth bearing the imprint of Christ's face. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling green hills and a distant view of a fortified building with a tower. The sky is blue with stylized clouds.",
