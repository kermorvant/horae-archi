    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, a group of figures is depicted in a landscape setting. A central figure, likely a woman, is veiled and appears to be praying or in supplication. She is surrounded by other individuals, some of whom are also gesturing with their hands raised. Behind them, a large, rounded mound or hill dominates the background, with some suggestion of foliage or trees. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong contrasts and hatching lines.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a moment of prayer or petition, possibly related to a miracle or a plea for divine intervention. The central veiled figure could represent a supplicant, and the surrounding figures are witnesses or participants in the prayer. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical event is difficult to pinpoint, but it evokes themes of faith and communal devotion.",
