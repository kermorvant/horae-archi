    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely Saint Margaret, seated triumphantly on a dragon. She is dressed in an orange tunic and a blue mantle, with a halo indicating her sainthood. Her hands are clasped in prayer, looking upwards towards a divine hand descending from a blue sky, from which rays of light emanate. The dragon, depicted as a monstrous, scaly creature with a gaping mouth, is subdued beneath her. The figures are situated within an architectural setting that appears to be a pavilion or a stylized representation of a sacred space, with ornate columns and arches supporting a striped roof. The background is a patterned red tapestry. Below the dragon and the saint is a green grassy area bordered by a crenellated wall, suggesting a fortified or elevated position.",
