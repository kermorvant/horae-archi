    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral setting with several figures and sheep. On the left, a man in a white tunic and hose, with a patterned pouch at his waist, walks hand-in-hand with a woman in a red dress holding a staff and a net-like bag. A small white dog runs in front of them. To the right, a man in a brown tunic and blue cap sits next to a woman in a blue dress, both holding or interacting with sheep. A flock of sheep is visible in the background, amidst stylized trees and foliage. The overall impression is one of rural activity and peaceful coexistence with nature.",
