    "scene_description_enriched": "A young person, likely a boy, dressed in a long blue robe, stands in a barren landscape. He is pouring water from an ornate, golden jug onto the ground. The setting is outdoors, with sparse vegetation, bare trees, and rolling hills in the background under a pale blue sky. The scene evokes a sense of nurturing or perhaps a symbolic act of bringing life to the earth.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The pouring of water can symbolize various concepts, including purification, fertility, or the act of creation. In a devotional context, it might represent the pouring of grace or the nurturing of faith. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or liturgical event is not definitively identifiable, but it aligns with themes of life-giving and sustenance.",
