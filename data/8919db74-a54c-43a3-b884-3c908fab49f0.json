    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a man identified as David, wearing a blue robe and a crown, holds a harp. He stands before a group of soldiers in armor, some holding spears. In the center, a haloed figure in a grey robe is being led forward. To the right, a seated figure in a blue, ornate robe, likely a king or judge, presides over the scene, with another figure in a red robe standing behind him. The background shows architectural elements including columns, arches, and windows, suggesting an interior space. The overall scene appears to represent a moment of judgment or presentation, possibly related to the biblical narrative of David.",
