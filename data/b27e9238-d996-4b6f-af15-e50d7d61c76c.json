    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a rustic setting. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child is reaching for a chalice held by an elderly man kneeling before them. Two Magi are present: one, richly robed in blue and red with a fur collar and a golden crown, stands holding a golden vessel; the other, also crowned and dressed in blue with gold embellishments, stands holding a golden casket. Behind them, a simple, thatched-roof structure is visible. The background features a green landscape with trees and distant blue mountains under a sky with a blue celestial orb. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with gold illumination.",
