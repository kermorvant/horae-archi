    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds. Two shepherds, one in a blue robe and the other in a white robe with a red collar, are shown outdoors in a pastoral landscape. They are looking upwards with expressions of awe and surprise, holding staffs. A flock of sheep is behind them, and a dog is at the feet of the shepherd in white. Above them, in a celestial realm indicated by a blue sky with golden rays and stars, three angels are visible. One angel, in the center and slightly forward, holds a scroll with musical notation. The angels appear to be delivering a message from above. In the background, distant buildings with spires suggest a settlement or fortified area.",
