    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint or the Virgin Mary, stands draped in a vibrant blue mantle over an orange undergarment. She wears a white veil covering her head and neck. In her hands, she holds a rectangular box or book in her left hand and a golden vessel, possibly an ointment jar, in her right. The background is a rich, textured red, suggestive of brocade or tapestry, framed by an ornate border. The floor is decorated with a geometric pattern of diamonds and squares in shades of red, yellow, and blue. The figure's posture is slightly bowed, and her gaze is directed downwards, conveying a sense of solemnity or contemplation. This iconography, particularly the ointment jar, strongly suggests the scene depicts one of the Holy Women at the Sepulchre on Easter morning, preparing to anoint Christ's body.",
