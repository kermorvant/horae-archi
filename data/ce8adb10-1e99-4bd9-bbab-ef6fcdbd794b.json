    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed woman, dressed in a vibrant red robe with gold embellishments, sits at a wooden lectern, diligently writing in a large open book. She wears a blue veil over her head. The lectern is part of a wooden structure with shelves holding a few objects, including a bottle and books. To the left, a lion reclines on a tiled floor. The scene appears to be set within an interior space with arched doorways and windows revealing a glimpse of an outdoor landscape with buildings and trees. Niches with small statues are visible on the wall.",
