The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and golden halo, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child, who is also haloed. Saint Joseph, with a red hat and cloak, walks beside the donkey, holding a staff and leading the animal. They are depicted in an outdoor setting with rolling green hills, trees, and distant, stylized buildings on hilltops under a blue sky with golden rays emanating from above. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs and gold leaf.",
