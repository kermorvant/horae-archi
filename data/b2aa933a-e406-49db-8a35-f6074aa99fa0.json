    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Betrayal of Christ in a garden setting. Christ, identifiable by his halo, is embraced by Judas, while soldiers with spears and torches surround them. One soldier, possibly Peter, is shown cutting off the ear of a servant, who is falling to the ground. In the background, a walled city with towers is visible under a starry blue sky, and a golden chalice sits on a mound. The overall atmosphere is one of conflict and impending doom.",
