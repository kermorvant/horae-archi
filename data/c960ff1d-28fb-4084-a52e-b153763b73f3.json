    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, possibly King David, is seated and playing a large, multi-stringed instrument resembling a harp or lyre. He wears a turban-like headdress and a flowing robe. Behind him, a winged angel leans in, appearing to whisper or guide him. The scene is set within an architectural space with columns and what appears to be a decorative screen or wall behind the figures. To the left, a table holds a chalice and other objects, suggesting a devotional or scholarly setting.",
