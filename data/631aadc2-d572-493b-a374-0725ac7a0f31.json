    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, seated on a pink cushion. To the left, an angel with blue wings and a red robe kneels with hands clasped in prayer. The background features a golden, textured wall with vertical lines and a red architectural element above. The figures are positioned on a tiled floor, with a green, grassy area visible behind them. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene, likely representing the Madonna and Child with an attendant angel.",
