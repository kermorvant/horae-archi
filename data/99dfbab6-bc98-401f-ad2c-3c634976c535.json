    "scene_description_enriched": "A lone male figure, likely a saint, stands centrally. He has dark hair and a beard, and a golden halo radiates behind his head. He is dressed in an orange tunic and a flowing green mantle. In his right hand, he holds a long staff with a pointed tip, and his left hand is raised, palm outward, in a gesture of blessing or teaching, with a small symbol resembling a building or a hand with a ring on his index finger. The background features a red, textured drapery adorned with gold scrolling patterns, suggesting a divine or regal setting. Below this, a green band acts as a dado, and the floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern of dark and light blue squares. The overall composition is framed by a decorative border.",
