    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a rustic stable setting. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, cradles the Christ Child, who is also haloed and holds a crown. Three Magi are present: one kneels, offering a crown; another holds a golden vessel; and the third, on the right, wears a crown and looks towards the child. A figure in a monk's habit kneels in prayer to the left, near a fire. In the background, a donkey and ox are visible within the stable structure. Beyond the stable, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills, a distant city under a starry blue sky with a prominent star, and figures on horseback. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, gilded arch decorated with floral motifs.",
