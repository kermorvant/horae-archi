    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a skeletal figure, personifying Death, holding a scythe and draped in cloth, dancing with a young woman. The woman is adorned with a crown, necklace, and a long, flowing gown. They are positioned against a stippled background with stars, framed by an arched architectural element with decorative tracery. The overall composition suggests a Dance of Death motif, where Death claims all, regardless of status or beauty.",
