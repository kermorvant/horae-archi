    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, with her lying on a richly patterned bed, surrounded by a group of haloed figures, likely the Apostles. Two angels attend to the Virgin, one with outstretched wings. Above them, in a celestial blue expanse, a figure representing God the Father, or possibly Christ, holds the infant Virgin, surrounded by seraphim with fiery wings. The background behind the figures is a dark, ornate tapestry with gold scrolling patterns. The foreground features a tiled floor. The overall composition suggests a sacred and solemn event, transitioning from the earthly realm of the Virgin's repose to the divine realm above.",
