    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael, an archangel with golden hair and a halo, clad in a white tunic and an orange cloak, standing over a black, dragon-like creature that lies on its back amidst flames. Saint Michael is shown in profile, with his head tilted downwards, his right foot pressing on the creature's neck. He holds a golden cross on a staff in his left hand and a white shield adorned with red fleur-de-lis in his right. His wings are spread, one red and one green, and he wears armor on his legs. The background features a lush green landscape with trees and rolling hills, and in the distance, a fortified settlement with towers and roofs is visible under a starry blue sky. The lower part of the scene shows flames licking at the base of the dragon.",
