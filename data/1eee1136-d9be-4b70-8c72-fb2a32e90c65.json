    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a tumultuous event, likely the Arrest of Christ. A central figure, presumably Christ, with a golden halo, is being embraced by a man in a purple robe, while another figure, also with a halo, is being struck with a sword. A soldier in armor stands to the left, and a crowd of figures with halos and soldiers with helmets surround them. In the background, stylized mountains and a radiant sun suggest an outdoor setting. The overall composition is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
