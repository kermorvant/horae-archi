    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic and fiery depiction of Hell, populated by numerous demons and tormented souls. In the center, a large, horned demon with a monstrous face and fur stands with its feet in a cauldron filled with human heads, holding a long staff. Other demons, some winged and others bestial, surround the cauldron, tormenting souls who are depicted falling from the sky or writhing in flames. The landscape is rugged and mountainous, with fires burning on rocky outcrops and smoke billowing into a dark, turbulent sky. In the background, a barren tree is shown with figures hanging from its branches, further emphasizing the suffering and damnation.",
