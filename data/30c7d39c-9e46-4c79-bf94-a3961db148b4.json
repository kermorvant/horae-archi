    "scene_description_enriched": "This image is a decorative border from a medieval manuscript, featuring a series of small, framed vignettes. The vignettes depict figures, some with beards and wearing headdresses, within architectural frames that suggest pointed arches and decorative elements. One vignette shows a figure with a beard and flowing hair, possibly a prophet or saint, looking upwards. Another shows a figure with a similar beard and a cap, pointing with their finger. The overall impression is of a series of devotional or narrative scenes, likely representing biblical figures or saints, framed by Gothic architectural motifs.",
