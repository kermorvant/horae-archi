    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a martyrdom, likely of a saint, being burned at the stake. A central figure, unclothed and engulfed in flames, lies on the ground. To the left, a crowd of onlookers dressed in medieval attire, some with beards and wearing turbans or hats, observe the event. One man in a blue robe points towards the burning figure, while another in a gold robe gestures with his hand. In the foreground, a man in a red tunic and blue leggings uses a stick to prod the flames. To the right, another figure in blue is pouring liquid, possibly oil, onto the fire. In the background, a fortified castle with towers and battlements is visible, set against a hilly landscape under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The scene is framed by ornate, gilded architectural elements resembling columns with decorative carvings.",
