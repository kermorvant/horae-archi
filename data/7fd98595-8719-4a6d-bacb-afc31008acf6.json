    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a kneeling figure in a golden robe, with hands clasped in prayer. Two figures stand over him, one on the left in a blue tunic and red leggings, holding a round object above his head, and another on the right in a red tunic, also holding a round object. In the background, a seated figure is visible, possibly in a meditative pose, amidst stylized trees and a green, textured landscape. The overall composition suggests a scene of supplication or martyrdom.",
