Her attire consists of a white undergarment, a purple robe with gold trim, and a red cloak also adorned with gold. She holds an open book in her left arm, while her right hand rests on a large sword that is sheathed and leans against her side. To her right, a wheel, a common attribute of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, is depicted. The background is a green field with golden foliage under a blue sky with faint golden clouds. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
