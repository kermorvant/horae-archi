    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Betrayal of Christ. Jesus, with a halo, is being embraced and kissed by Judas Iscariot, who is dressed in golden armor. Jesus is wearing a blue robe and has his arm around Judas. To Jesus' left, a figure in a blue robe and red cloak places a hand on the head of a kneeling figure in armor. Behind Jesus and Judas, a group of figures, some armed with spears, are visible against a blue background with red flames or torches. The overall impression is one of a dramatic arrest.",
