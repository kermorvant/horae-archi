    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within an architectural setting. The Virgin Mary, adorned with a blue mantle and halo, cradles the Christ Child. To her left, a woman in a red robe and blue headdress looks on, accompanied by a bearded man. To the right, two figures, one wearing a tall blue hat and the other a golden miter, present gifts to the child. The background features ornate columns and arches, suggesting an interior space, possibly a palace or a church. A red tapestry with gold patterns hangs behind the figures. A golden pitcher sits on a step in the foreground.",
