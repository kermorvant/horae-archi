    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, seated and draped in a blue robe, cradles the Christ Child on her lap. A golden halo surrounds her head, and a smaller halo encircles the child. Three Magi are present: one kneels before the Virgin and Child, offering a gift, while another stands and presents a chalice and a covered vessel. A third figure, richly dressed, stands behind the kneeling Magi. The stable is constructed of wood with a thatched roof, and a rustic fence is visible behind the figures. In the background, a green, hilly landscape is dotted with trees, and a castle or fortified building is perched on a distant hill. Rays of golden light emanate from a star-like symbol in the sky, illuminating the scene.",
