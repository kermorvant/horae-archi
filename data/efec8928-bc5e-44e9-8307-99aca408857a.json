    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child on her lap. To her right stands a bearded man, likely Saint Joseph, holding a golden vessel. To the left, three kings approach. One king, kneeling, offers a gift. Two other kings stand behind him, also bearing gifts. The figures are set against a gold background, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting, with a simple architectural structure, possibly a stable or shelter, visible behind the Virgin and Child.",
