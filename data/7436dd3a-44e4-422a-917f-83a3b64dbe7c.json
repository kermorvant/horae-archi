    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a martyrdom, with a haloed figure in a richly patterned blue and gold robe kneeling on the ground, looking upwards with an outstretched hand. This figure is being dragged by a rope held by several men in elaborate attire, one of whom wields a club. Behind them, a cityscape with tall, multi-story buildings and smoking chimneys is visible. To the right, an architectural structure with pointed arches, columns, and ornate blue and gold vaulted ceilings suggests a religious interior. A tonsured cleric in a dark robe stands within this structure, attending to an altar with an open book and a chalice. The juxtaposition of the violent act in the foreground and the serene religious ceremony in the background creates a dramatic contrast.",
