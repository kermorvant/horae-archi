    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bishop, adorned in ornate vestments and a mitre, seated on a raised platform, leaning forward to receive or bless a child held by a woman. The child, depicted as an infant, is naked and held upright. To the left of the woman, another woman stands holding a basket. Behind the bishop, a man in a cap and dark robe stands attentively. The architectural setting is an interior space with a vaulted ceiling featuring star-like decorations and arched windows. The bishop is seated on a richly decorated, multi-tiered structure that resembles a throne or altar. The overall scene suggests a religious or devotional event, possibly the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, or a similar ritual involving a bishop and a child.",
