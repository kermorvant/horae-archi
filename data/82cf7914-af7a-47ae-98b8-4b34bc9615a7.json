    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a peasant, is depicted in the act of threshing grain. They are dressed in a blue tunic, red stockings, and black boots, with a multi-colored hat on their head. The figure wields a flail, striking a pile of harvested wheat or barley. The background features a decorative tapestry-like pattern of fleur-de-lis and diamond shapes. The ground is rendered with earthy tones, suggesting a field or farmyard, with scattered leaves or debris. To the right, a large bundle of sheaves stands upright, indicating the harvest is in progress.",
