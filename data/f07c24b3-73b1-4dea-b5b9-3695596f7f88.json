A cleric, wearing a blue and gold cope over a white alb and holding a book and a processional cross, presides over the ceremony. Two men are actively lowering a shrouded body into a grave, while another cleric, dressed in a white alb and red collar, stands nearby holding a processional cross. Behind them, a walled garden with trees and grave markers is visible. The architectural elements suggest a religious setting, possibly a churchyard or monastery grounds.",
