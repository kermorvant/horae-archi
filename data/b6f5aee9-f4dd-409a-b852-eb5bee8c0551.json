    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, an angel with wings kneels and presents a scroll to the Virgin Mary, who is seated on the right. The angel is dressed in red and blue, while Mary wears a blue robe with a red undergarment. Above the angel, a bearded figure, likely God the Father, is depicted in a blue sky, gesturing towards the scene. The background features a rich red tapestry with gold scrolling patterns. To the right of Mary, a golden architectural element, possibly a window or niche, is visible. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sacred status.",
