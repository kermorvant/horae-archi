    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child swaddled in white. To the right, a man in a red robe, possibly Saint Joseph, walks alongside, playing a pipe. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or spiritual setting, with stylized trees and a hint of architectural structure on the left. The figures are rendered with a focus on their devotional significance rather than strict realism.",
