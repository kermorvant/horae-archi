    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures standing before a brick wall with an arched opening, behind which are buildings with red roofs and turrets. A central figure, dressed in a blue robe with gold trim, gestures towards sacks filled with grain. To the right, several other figures, also in blue and red robes, are presented, one of whom holds a bowl. The overall setting suggests an exchange or distribution of goods within a fortified urban environment.",
