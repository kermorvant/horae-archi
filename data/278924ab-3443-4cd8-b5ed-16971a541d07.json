    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Archangel Michael, identifiable by his wings and armor, triumphing over a demonic figure. Michael, with red wings spread, stands with one foot on the prostrate demon, raising a sword to strike. The demon is dark-skinned, horned, and appears to be writhing. The background is a rocky, mountainous landscape. The scene is framed by decorative architectural elements on the left and right, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript page.",
