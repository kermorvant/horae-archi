    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Archangel Gabriel, with large blue wings, kneels and presents a scroll with text to the Virgin Mary, who is on the right. She is also kneeling and looking at a book. Rays of light descend from the upper left, suggesting divine intervention. The background features a brick wall, an arched window with tracery, and a richly decorated red curtain. Architectural elements include columns supporting blue, star-decorated arches, and a bed canopy. The overall impression is one of a sacred event taking place in a domestic or chapel-like interior.",
