    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned man, kneeling and with his hands clasped in prayer, is being addressed by an angel. The man wears a royal crown, a blue tunic, and a red cloak. His gaze is directed towards the angel, and he has his finger touching his lips. The angel, depicted with blond hair and wearing an orange tunic and a blue mantle, holds a golden chalice in its left hand and points with its right index finger towards the man. The background is a rich blue tapestry with a diamond pattern of orange dots. The scene is framed by an elaborate initial 'D' decorated with floral motifs and gold leaf. Behind the angel, a suggestion of architectural elements is visible, including what appear to be columns and a patterned wall, possibly representing a divine or heavenly space.",
