    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a humble stable setting, partially enclosed by a wooden structure with a thatched roof. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary kneels in prayer, her hands clasped, wearing a vibrant blue robe. Before her lies a small, pale figure, presumably the Christ Child. To the right, a man, possibly a shepherd or a monk, dressed in blue robes and a brown cowl, approaches holding a lantern. The background reveals a stone wall and a glimpse of a hilly landscape with trees under a blue sky with stylized clouds. The overall impression is one of quiet reverence and the humble beginnings of the Nativity.",
