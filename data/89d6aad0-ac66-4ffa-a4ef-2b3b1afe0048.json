    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in an outdoor setting. On the left, two women are shown walking away from the viewer. The woman in the foreground wears a red dress and is labeled 'SVS[P]ITIO' (Suspicion). Behind her, a woman in a blue dress is labeled 'IGNORATIA' (Ignorance). To the right, a crowned man, labeled 'CRE[DVLVS]' (Credulous), is shown with his hands clasped in prayer or supplication, facing the women. He appears to be reaching out towards them. Behind him, a green sign with the word 'OMNINO' (Completely/Entirely) is displayed on a decorative stand. The ground is depicted as a grassy field, and the sky is a pale blue. The overall composition suggests a moral allegory.",
