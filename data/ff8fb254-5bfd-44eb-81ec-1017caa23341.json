    "scene_description_enriched": "Three tonsured monks in white habits and cloaks stand behind a draped sarcophagus, with one holding an open book. To the right, two figures in dark, hooded habits are seated, facing away from the viewer. The scene takes place indoors, within a room that features arched windows with tracery and a decorative wall hanging. The sarcophagus is covered with a light blue cloth adorned with gold ornamentation, suggesting a burial or memorial context. The presence of monks and the sarcophagus points to a religious ceremony or commemoration, possibly a funeral or a requiem mass.",
