    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures within an interior architectural setting. On the right, a man wearing a red cap and a fur-trimmed collar stands, holding a scroll or document. In the center and left, two younger figures are shown. The central figure, kneeling, wears a red robe over a green garment and holds a small book. Behind him, another figure in a blue tunic looks on. The background suggests an interior space with decorative architectural elements, including what appears to be a screen or partition with arched openings. The overall impression is one of a formal exchange or presentation, possibly related to learning or religious devotion.",
