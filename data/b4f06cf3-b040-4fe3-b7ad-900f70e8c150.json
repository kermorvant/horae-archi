    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ in glory, seated on a golden orb, with wounds visible on his hands and torso, draped in a red cloak. He is flanked by two figures: on the left, the Virgin Mary, with hands clasped in prayer, and on the right, a bearded male figure, likely an apostle or saint, also in prayer. Above Christ, two blue winged figures, possibly angels, are depicted. The lower portion of the image shows a landscape with several figures, including a child and a woman, emerging from the earth or water, with hands raised in supplication. The overall setting is celestial, with a bright yellow halo around Christ and a blue sky.",
