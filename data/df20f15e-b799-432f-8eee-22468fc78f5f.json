    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a saint or biblical character, is depicted holding a sword in their right hand, with the blade pointing upwards. They wear a jeweled headdress and ornate clothing. To the left, a banner with Latin text is visible, partially obscured by the figure. The background suggests an architectural setting with decorative elements, possibly part of a larger illuminated initial or border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's attire and the sword suggest a warrior saint or a figure associated with judgment or authority. The Latin text on the banner might provide a clue to their identity or the specific devotional context, but it is not fully legible. Without further context or clearer text, a definitive interpretation is difficult, but it likely represents a figure of spiritual significance.",
