    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial gathering, likely the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. Christ, seated on a throne of clouds and supported by golden wings, places a crown upon the head of the Virgin Mary, who kneels before him. Both are surrounded by a multitude of angels, some playing musical instruments like harps and lutes, others holding crowns. Below, a congregation of saints and holy figures, including monks and a bishop, gaze upwards in adoration. The background is a vibrant blue sky, suggesting a heavenly realm. The entire composition is framed by an ornate, foliate border typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
