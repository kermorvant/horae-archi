On the right, a bishop, identifiable by his mitre and beard, stands before an altar. On the left, a woman, possibly the Virgin Mary, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching towards the bishop. Behind her, another woman holds a basket containing doves, and a bearded man stands next to her. The figures are all depicted with halos, indicating their sanctity. The background is a decorative tapestry-like pattern. The altar is a prominent architectural element in the foreground.",
