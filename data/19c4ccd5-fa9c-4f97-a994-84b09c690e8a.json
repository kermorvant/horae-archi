    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a centaur, a mythical creature with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a horse, in profile. The centaur has a long, flowing beard and hair, and is depicted drawing a bow. The creature is set against a blue sky and a green, grassy landscape with some trees in the background. The scene is framed by an ornate gold border, typical of medieval manuscript illumination. The centaur's body is rendered in a golden hue, suggesting a symbolic or allegorical representation rather than a naturalistic one. The overall composition is contained within an arched frame.",
