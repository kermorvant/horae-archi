    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a table laden with food. In the foreground, a person in a blue tunic sleeps with their head on the table, surrounded by loaves of bread. To their right, another figure in a blue tunic drinks from a horn. In the center, a man in a red robe embraces a woman. Another figure in a red robe with a hood looks down, seemingly in contemplation or sorrow. The background is a dense, tessellated pattern of red, gold, and blue squares, suggesting a rich tapestry or a stylized representation of the night sky. The overall impression is one of a feast or gathering, possibly with elements of revelry and melancholy.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a feast or banquet, possibly alluding to themes of earthly pleasures and their transient nature, or perhaps a specific biblical narrative involving a feast. The presence of sleeping figures and the somber expressions of some individuals might suggest a moralizing context, warning against excess or the fleeting nature of worldly joys. Without further context, a definitive biblical interpretation is difficult, but it could relate to stories of indulgence or judgment.",
