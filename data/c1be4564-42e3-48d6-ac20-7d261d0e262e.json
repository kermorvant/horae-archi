    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body emaciated and draped in a white loincloth. He has a halo and a sorrowful expression. To the left, a group of women, including the Virgin Mary in blue, are shown in mourning, with one woman supporting another. To the right, a figure in a regal robe and headdress, possibly a Roman official or a representative of the Jewish authorities, gestures towards the cross. A skull and bones are visible at the foot of the cross, symbolizing Golgotha, the \"place of the skull.\" The background is a stylized landscape with green trees and a blue sky dotted with stars and a crescent moon, suggesting a celestial or symbolic setting.",
