    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by several figures. Christ, wearing a dark robe and a halo, bears the weight of a large wooden cross. He is being pushed and pulled by other individuals. To his left, a man in a tan tunic and red hose gestures with his hand, appearing to urge Christ forward. Behind Christ, a figure in red seems to be supporting the cross. To Christ's right, a man in a blue tunic and red hat holds a trident-like weapon, and another figure in a green tunic and blue cap also appears to be involved in the procession. A man in a red tunic and dark hose, holding a spear, walks ahead of Christ. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling green hills and scattered trees under a blue sky. The scene is framed by decorative borders typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
