    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child across a body of water. Saint Christopher, an elderly man with a long white beard, wears a blue robe and a crown, and carries a staff. He is wading through turbulent blue water, with waves indicated by white brushstrokes. The Christ Child, with a halo and a golden crown, sits on Saint Christopher's shoulders, looking forward. In the background, a distant city with spires and towers is visible. To the left, on a rocky outcrop, a small pink building with a blue roof and a bell tower stands amongst trees. Below this building, a tonsured monk in a dark robe is seated, reading a book. The landscape is hilly and green, with a flock of sheep visible in the distance on the right.",
