    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a decorative, star-shaped frame filled with gold leaf and blue and red ornamental tracery. On the left, a man in a pink tunic and gold trim is shown looking upwards, holding a scroll that unfurls around him. On the right, a woman in a blue, gold-spotted robe and a golden halo gestures towards the man with her right hand, her index finger raised. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The overall composition is highly stylized and ornamental, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
