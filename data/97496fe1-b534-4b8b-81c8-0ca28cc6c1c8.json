    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, an angel, identified as Angel Gabriel by his wings and halo, holds a staff with lilies and directs a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, towards a woman on the right. The woman, identified as the Virgin Mary, is seated and reading from a book, with her hand on her chest. She wears a hennin and a mantle. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the tiled floor and the presence of a draped curtain behind Mary. A vase with lilies stands between the two figures.",
