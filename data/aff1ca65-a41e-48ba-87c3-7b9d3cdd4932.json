    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be a domestic or courtly setting. On the left, a man with a beard, possibly representing Christ, is being held by two other men. One man in a blue tunic and orange hose grips his arm, while another in a purple garment places a hand on his shoulder. A young boy in a pink tunic and blue hose kneels before a seated figure. This seated figure, wearing a peach-colored robe and a blue and white striped hat, holds a bowl. To the right, a man in a blue tunic pours liquid from a vessel into the bowl held by the seated figure. The background is a decorative, patterned textile, suggesting an indoor or draped setting. The overall impression is one of a trial or judgment, possibly related to the Passion of Christ, given the depiction of Christ being apprehended and the act of washing hands, which can symbolize a denial of responsibility.",
