    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with red wings and blonde hair descends from a blue, gold-flecked sky, carrying a scroll that unfurls with illegible text. Below, two figures walk across a green, grassy landscape dotted with dark, woolly shapes that appear to be sheep. The figure on the left wears a dark cloak and a red cap, leaning on a staff. The figure on the right is dressed in a vibrant pink tunic over a white undergarment, yellow hose, and carries a bagpipe slung over his shoulder. The scene is likely a depiction of the Annunciation to the Shepherds, with the angel delivering the divine message to the shepherds in the field.",
