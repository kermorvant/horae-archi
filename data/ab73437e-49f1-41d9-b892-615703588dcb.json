    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man, likely Saint John the Baptist, presented by a woman wearing a wimple and veil. The woman holds a cloth, from which the man's head emerges. The style is a woodcut illustration, with bold outlines and minimal detail. The figures are presented frontally, with the man's gaze directed slightly to the viewer's left. The scene is abstract and lacks any architectural or environmental context, suggesting a focus on the figures and their symbolic representation.",
