    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a turban-like headdress. He is shown in profile, looking to the left. His wavy hair and beard are visible. He is draped in flowing robes. To his left, a portion of an architectural structure, possibly a niche or a decorative element, is visible. To his right, a patterned background suggests foliage or grapes, and a small architectural element resembling a capital or a small tower is present. The overall style is that of a woodcut or engraving, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a prophet or a biblical figure, possibly from the Old Testament, given the attire and beard. Without further context or accompanying text, a specific identification is difficult, but the depiction aligns with common representations of figures like Isaiah or Jeremiah in medieval art.",
