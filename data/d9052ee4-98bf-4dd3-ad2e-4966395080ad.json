    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child, who is also haloed. She wears a blue mantle over a gold-trimmed garment. Beside them walks a bearded man, presumably Saint Joseph, also haloed, wearing a blue hood and a red cloak over a blue tunic. He carries a staff over his shoulder with a white bundle tied to it. The figures are set against a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a winding path. In the background, a stylized city with towers and domes is visible, suggesting their destination or a place they are passing by. The entire scene is framed by decorative borders.",
