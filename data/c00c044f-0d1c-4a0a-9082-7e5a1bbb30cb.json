    "scene_description_enriched": "In a rocky, outdoor landscape, a man identified as Christ kneels in prayer, his hands clasped and his gaze directed upwards. To his left, three disciples sleep: one rests his head on his hand, another slumps against a rock, and a third is partially obscured. In the background, a group of soldiers approaches, led by Judas, indicated by a wooden structure resembling a makeshift shelter or scaffold. Above Christ, an angel descends, pointing towards him, possibly offering solace or a divine message. The scene is framed by decorative architectural elements on the right, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
