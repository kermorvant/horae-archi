    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a landscape. In the center, a haloed figure in a blue robe is being led by several men. One man in an orange tunic and red hat grips the central figure's arm, while another in a blue tunic pulls a rope attached to the central figure's waist. To the left, a man in a red robe holds a large sword, and another figure lies on the ground. The background is a green landscape with stylized trees and distant buildings, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall impression is one of a procession or a scene of capture and suffering.",
