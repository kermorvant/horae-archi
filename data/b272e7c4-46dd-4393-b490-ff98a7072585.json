In the center, a group of figures appears to be in distress or engaged in a dramatic event, with one figure raising their arms. To the right, two figures are in motion, one appearing to embrace or restrain the other. In the foreground, a figure lies prostrate on the ground. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of green and yellow, with hints of red and gold in the decorative border at the top.
