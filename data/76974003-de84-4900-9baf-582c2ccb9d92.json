    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed women in a verdant landscape. The woman on the left, dressed in a blue robe, stands with her hands slightly extended. The woman on the right, wearing a reddish-brown robe over a blue undergarment and a white wimple, approaches her, also with hands extended as if in greeting or conversation. In the background, a complex of stone buildings with towers and spires is visible, nestled amongst trees. The sky above is a deep blue, with stylized clouds and rays of light emanating from the upper left corner. The overall impression is one of a pastoral setting with a hint of urban or monastic architecture in the distance.",
