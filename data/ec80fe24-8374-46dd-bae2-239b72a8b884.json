    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as a saint by his halo and regal attire, is seated on an ornate throne. He wears a golden crown and a blue mantle over a white garment with red cross-like markings. He holds an open book in his left hand and gestures with his right. The background is decorated with a rich, tessellated pattern of blue, red, and gold squares, suggesting a divine or elevated setting. The floor is also patterned with black and white diamonds. The overall impression is one of authority and spiritual wisdom.",
