She is dressed in a draped robe and holds a cylindrical object, possibly a reliquary or a vessel, close to her chest with both hands. The background is abstract, with dark, textured bands suggesting clouds or a turbulent sky. The figure's pose and the object she holds suggest a devotional context, possibly representing a saint associated with relics or a specific martyrdom.",
