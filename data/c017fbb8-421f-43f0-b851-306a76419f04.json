    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two male figures standing against a green, patterned background. The figure on the left wears a red hat, a white alb with a red cape over it, and holds a red book. He has a long beard and a white collar. The figure on the right is dressed in a grey monastic habit with a hood and a rope belt. He has stigmata visible on his hands. The floor is tiled with a diamond pattern. The overall impression is of a devotional image, possibly representing two saints or religious figures in conversation or contemplation.",
