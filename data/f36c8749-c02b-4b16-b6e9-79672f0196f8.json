    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Matthew, identifiable by his halo and scholarly activity, seated outdoors and writing on a scroll. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a flowing yellow mantle. Beside him, a winged angel kneels, holding a quill and inkpot, seemingly in the act of dictating or assisting Saint Matthew. The background is a pastoral landscape with rolling hills, scattered trees, and a body of water. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
