    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body emaciated and crowned with thorns. A sign with 'INRI' is affixed to the cross. Below, a group of figures surrounds the cross. To the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, kneels in sorrow, supported by another woman. To the right, a man in a blue and gold robe holds a cloth to support Christ's body, while another figure in a pink robe looks up with hands clasped. In the background, a ladder leans against the cross, and a man in a red tunic is positioned on the crossbeam. Beyond the figures, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills and a walled city with towers and blue-roofed buildings. The sky is a vibrant blue with stylized clouds and celestial bodies.",
