    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and gesture of blessing or teaching, interacting with a group of people. He stands within an arched architectural structure, possibly a doorway or a niche, with other figures behind him. In front of him, two individuals are shown in supplication or receiving a blessing. One is seated on a surface, appearing ill or infirm, with hands clasped in prayer. Another figure kneels before Christ, also with hands joined. The overall setting suggests a moment of healing or divine intervention.",
