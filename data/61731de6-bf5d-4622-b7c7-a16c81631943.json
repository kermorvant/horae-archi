    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a profile view of a bearded man wearing a conical hat with a band. He is dressed in layered garments, and his left hand appears to be holding something. The background is filled with a decorative pattern, possibly representing foliage or drapery, framed by an arched architectural element. The overall style is that of a woodcut or early engraving, suggesting a secular or devotional context rather than a specific biblical narrative.",
