    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of souls, naked and with clasped hands, being consumed by flames within the gaping maw of a monstrous sea creature, likely representing hell or a leviathan. Above them, two angels descend; one pours water from a vessel, perhaps symbolizing divine mercy or purification, while the other gestures towards the scene. At the very top, a bearded figure, identified as God, blesses the scene and holds a globe, signifying his dominion. The background is a rich, textured red with gold decorative elements, suggesting a divine or otherworldly setting.",
