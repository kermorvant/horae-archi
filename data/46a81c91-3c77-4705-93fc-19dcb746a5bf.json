    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men gathered around a wooden table where a pale, unclothed figure lies. Two figures in blue robes are holding the body, while others in gold robes appear to be examining or attending to it. One figure in a gold and yellow striped garment is leaning over the body, seemingly performing a procedure. The setting is an interior space with ornate columns, some twisted and decorated with foliage, and a richly patterned red tapestry on the right. In the background, through an arched opening, a garden with trees and a fence is visible. The overall atmosphere suggests a solemn or ritualistic event, possibly a medical examination or a religious martyrdom.",
