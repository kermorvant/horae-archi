    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Catherine of Alexandria, identifiable by her crown and the palm frond, a symbol of martyrdom, held in her right hand. She is shown in profile, looking downwards, holding an open book. Her elaborate blue robe, adorned with gold patterns, drapes over a red undergarment. At her feet lies a severed head wearing a crown, representing her victory over paganism and her triumph over earthly power. In the background, a group of figures are gathered around a breaking wheel, the instrument of her torture, and in the distance, a fortified city or castle is visible on a hill. The overall composition suggests a narrative of martyrdom and divine victory.",
