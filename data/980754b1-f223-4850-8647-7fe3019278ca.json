    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned figure, likely a king, kneeling on the ground. He has a long beard and is holding a smaller figure, possibly a child or a representation of a divine entity, against his chest. The kneeling figure is richly adorned with patterned clothing and a crown. Behind him, a tent-like structure with ornate detailing is visible. To the right, a book rests on a stand, and above it, a haloed figure with a beard is depicted, radiating light. The overall setting appears to be within an architectural frame, suggesting an indoor or partially enclosed space.",
