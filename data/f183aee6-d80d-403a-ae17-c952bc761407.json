    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a rudimentary wooden stable structure. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue robe, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Child is radiant with a halo. One of the Magi, kneeling, offers a gift, while another stands, holding a golden chalice. Two other figures, likely attendants or other Magi, are visible behind them. The background shows a landscape with hills and a blue sky, with rays of light emanating from the Christ Child. In the foreground, a dog lies on the ground next to a crown.",
