    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, possibly a saint or allegorical figure, is depicted seated outdoors. She wears a head covering and a long, draped garment. Her left hand rests on a small animal, possibly a lamb or dog, which is nestled in her lap. Her right hand holds a flowering branch, likely a lily, a common symbol of purity. The setting appears to be a garden or natural landscape, suggested by the presence of foliage and the overall open-air feel. The scene evokes a sense of gentle contemplation and possibly represents a virtue or a specific devotional theme.",
