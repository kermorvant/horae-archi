    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within an illuminated manuscript initial. The Virgin Mary, seated on a green draped dais, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child, radiating golden light, is reaching towards a golden chalice offered by the first Magus, an elderly man with a white beard, wearing a golden robe. Behind him, two other Magi, crowned and richly dressed, observe the scene. The architectural setting is a stable-like structure with a brick wall and a wooden roof, open to a blue sky with a suggestion of foliage. The scene is framed by a decorative blue initial with white and gold ornamentation, set against a gold leaf background.",
