    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation ceremony, likely the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. An elderly man, dressed in a bishop's mitre and ornate golden vestments, holds the Christ Child. The child is naked and appears to be looking towards the viewer. To the right, a woman in a blue mantle, presumably the Virgin Mary, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer. Behind the central figures, a crowd of onlookers is visible. The setting appears to be within a building, suggested by the presence of an architectural structure with a canopy overhead and a stone altar-like structure in the foreground. The overall atmosphere is one of reverence and devotion.",
