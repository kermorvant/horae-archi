    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a nude woman emerging from a bath or pool on the left, while a crowned man, seated within an architectural structure, gestures towards her from the right. The man wears a regal robe and a crown, and his beard is prominent. The architecture behind him appears to be a classical building with columns and an inscription that reads 'ACTIANO'. The background on the left shows a landscape with trees and a dark, textured sky. On the right, a large, rounded object, possibly a shield or a helmet, rests on the ground. The overall composition suggests a narrative scene, possibly from classical mythology or a biblical story involving temptation or judgment.",
