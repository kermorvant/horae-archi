    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the central cross and two thieves on either side. Below the crosses, a crowd of onlookers is gathered, including a group of women in the foreground, one of whom is dressed in blue and appears to be the Virgin Mary, and another in orange, possibly Mary Magdalene. A figure in orange on horseback observes the scene. Behind the crowd, a multitude of soldiers with spears stand at attention. In the background, a stylized city with towers and buildings is visible against a bright blue sky. The overall impression is one of solemnity and sorrow, with the focus on the suffering of Christ and the reactions of those present.",
