    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body pale and marked by wounds. A scroll above his head bears the inscription 'IHS NR'. To the left of the cross stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle over a golden robe, her hands clasped in prayer. To the right, another figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also in a blue mantle over a golden robe, holds an open book. The setting is a barren landscape with rocky outcrops and distant, stylized buildings. A skull is visible at the base of the cross on the left, symbolizing Golgotha. The sky is a vibrant blue with scattered gold flecks.",
