    "scene_description_enriched": "Three skeletal figures, draped in white and pink cloths, are depicted in a forest setting. The figure on the left gestures outwards with an outstretched arm. The central figure, also gesturing, appears to be interacting with a large, triangular wooden structure. The figure on the right holds a scythe aloft, its blade curved and sharp, and also gestures. The background is filled with trees, their foliage rendered in dark green with gold accents, and a distant blue landscape with hints of buildings. The scene is a representation of the Dance of Death, a medieval allegorical motif that emphasizes the universality of death.",
