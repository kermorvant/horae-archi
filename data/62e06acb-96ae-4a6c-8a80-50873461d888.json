He holds the crucified Christ, whose body bears wounds and is draped in a white loincloth. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers between them. Surrounding them are multiple figures with blue faces and wings, likely representing angels. The figures are set against a blue background with golden rays, suggesting a divine or heavenly realm. Below the figures, a text in Latin is visible, illuminated with decorative initials.",
