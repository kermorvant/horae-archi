    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman in a hooded garment, with her right hand raised in a gesture of warding off. She is surrounded by various animals, including what appears to be a goat or ram on the left and another animal, possibly a pig or boar, on the right. Behind the woman, a demonic figure with a grotesque face and pointed ears is visible, reaching out with its left arm. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a textured or perhaps otherworldly setting. The overall composition evokes a sense of spiritual struggle or temptation.",
