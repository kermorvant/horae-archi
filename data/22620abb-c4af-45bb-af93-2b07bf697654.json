    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his head bowed and a crown of thorns on his head. A halo surrounds his head, and rays of light emanate from it. A scroll with the inscription \"I.N.R.I.\" is placed above his head. To the left of the cross, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, is supported by Saint John the Evangelist, who is dressed in red. Another woman, possibly Mary Magdalene, stands behind them. To the right of the cross, a figure in a green robe and a turban addresses a soldier in armor. A dark-winged angel is depicted in the sky, near Christ's head. The setting is an outdoor landscape with a blue sky and golden clouds.",
