He reaches down towards a man below, who is looking upwards with hands clasped in prayer. This man, with a long white beard and wearing a golden-brown robe, is positioned within a vibrant red and blue circular motif adorned with intricate gold patterns. The background is a rich red, with golden rays emanating from the central motif and scattered cloud-like forms.",
