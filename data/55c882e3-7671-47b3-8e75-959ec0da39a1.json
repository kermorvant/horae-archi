    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. The Angel Gabriel, crowned and winged, approaches the Virgin Mary, who is kneeling and reading a book. Gabriel holds a lily and gestures towards Mary, while the Holy Spirit descends as a dove from a radiant light above. Two other angels are present, one on the left holding a golden rod and the other on the right, seemingly assisting Gabriel. The setting appears to be a richly decorated interior, with columns and drapery suggesting a noble or sacred space. In the background, a cityscape with a prominent church spire is visible.",
