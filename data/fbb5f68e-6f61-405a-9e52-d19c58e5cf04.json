    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a cap adorned with a circular emblem. He has long, wavy hair and is dressed in a tunic with decorative circular buttons. His hands are clasped in front of him. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, and the scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting an archway or niche with decorative tracery above. The overall impression is that of a portrait, possibly of a biblical figure or a saint, rendered in a woodcut style typical of medieval manuscripts.",
