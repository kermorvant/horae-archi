    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine vision. On the right, God the Father, crowned and with a long white beard, is seated on a throne draped with a rich red and gold patterned cloth. He holds the crucified Christ, whose body is rendered in pale tones, on a wooden cross. Three small angels with wings are visible above and behind God the Father. On the left, a man, likely a donor or a devout figure, kneels in prayer, dressed in a blue mantle lined with white fur and red cuffs. He is looking upwards towards the divine figures. Behind him, an arched window reveals a cityscape with towers and buildings. The architectural elements include a stone wall, an arched window with tracery, and a circular emblem with a coat of arms. The floor is tiled in a pinkish hue.",
