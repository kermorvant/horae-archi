    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial figure, likely an angel, descending from a blue, cloud-filled sky, radiating a golden halo. The angel, dressed in a blue robe, extends a hand downwards. Below, three women stand in a verdant landscape dotted with trees. The women are dressed in medieval attire: one in pink, one in blue, and one in red. They appear to be carrying or presenting loaves of bread. The overall setting is pastoral and outdoors, framed by decorative elements typical of a manuscript illumination.",
