    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered under an arched structure. In the foreground, a bearded man in a long robe stands, while another figure, also robed, sits to his right. Behind them, several other individuals are visible, some wearing hats. A small dog is depicted near the seated figure. The overall setting suggests an interior space, possibly a hall or a room within a building, indicated by the presence of architectural elements like an arch and what appears to be a piece of furniture or a column. The figures' interactions and attire are not clearly indicative of a specific biblical event without further context, but the composition suggests a narrative or devotional scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene's interpretation is uncertain without more context. However, the gathering of figures and the presence of a dog could allude to various biblical narratives or devotional themes. For instance, it might represent a scene from the life of a saint, a parable, or a moment of counsel or judgment. The bearded man in the foreground could be a figure of authority or importance.",
