    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony, likely a presentation or baptism, taking place within an interior architectural space. A central octagonal font, covered with a patterned cloth, is attended by a bearded man in a blue and red robe, gesturing towards the infant held by a woman in a blue habit. Several other figures, including women in veils and a woman carrying a basket with two birds, stand to the left, observing the event. The background features architectural elements such as columns, arches, and windows, suggesting a sacred or formal setting. The overall atmosphere is solemn and devotional.",
