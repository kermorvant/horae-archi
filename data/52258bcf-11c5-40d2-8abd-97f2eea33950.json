    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal court setting. On the left, a bearded king, adorned in a golden robe and ermine collar, is seated on a throne draped in blue and gold. Before him, a kneeling figure, likely a queen or princess, wearing a blue headdress and a rose-colored robe over a golden garment, offers him a scepter. Behind the king, a crowd of courtiers in various colored robes and hats observe the scene. To the right, three women in long dresses stand near a large window that looks out onto a landscape with rolling hills and a distant tower. The interior features a checkered floor and ornate architectural details, including columns and decorative friezes.",
