    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the creation of Eve from Adam's rib. God, wearing a crown and a royal robe, is shown reaching towards Adam, who lies asleep on the ground. An angel stands to God's left, placing a hand on God's shoulder. To God's right, Eve, depicted as a nude woman, stands with her hands clasped. Behind them, a tree laden with fruit, possibly from the Tree of Knowledge, is visible, with a serpent coiled around its trunk. In the background, a body of water flows past a lush green landscape dotted with trees, leading to a walled city with towers and spires. A peacock stands prominently on the right side of the composition, and several birds are scattered on the ground.",
