    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a domestic interior, possibly a kitchen or dining area, framed by a large archway. On the left, a woman in a dark hooded garment, likely the Virgin Mary, stands with her hands clasped in prayer or supplication. In the center, a round table holds a roasted bird or fowl, possibly a lamb, suggesting a meal. Behind the table, two figures are visible: a woman with a veiled head and an older man with a beard, both appearing to be engaged in conversation or observation. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet domesticity, possibly hinting at a religious event within a humble setting.",
