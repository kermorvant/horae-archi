    "scene_description_enriched": "Three crowned figures are depicted in profile, facing towards the right. The figure on the left, with long flowing hair, looks upwards and speaks. The central figure, also crowned and with hair visible, looks forward. The figure on the right, with long hair, also crowned, gazes upwards and gestures with clasped hands. All figures wear robes fastened with brooches and belts. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching to indicate form and drapery. No architectural elements or specific setting are visible, suggesting a focus on the figures themselves.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a group of saints or royalty, possibly in a moment of prayer or discourse. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific biblical or devotional event cannot be definitively identified. The crowns suggest royal status or sainthood.",
