    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, depicted in profile, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer. She wears a pink garment and a blue headdress adorned with gold patterns. To her left, a table is covered with a white cloth, upon which rests a dark, lidded vessel and a small, circular object. The background features vertical lines, possibly representing wooden paneling or drapery, with gold accents. The scene is framed by decorative borders and text, suggesting it is part of a manuscript illumination.",
