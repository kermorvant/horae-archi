    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral setting, two shepherds are tending to their flock of sheep. One shepherd, dressed in blue and red, stands and reaches upwards towards a celestial canopy of gold, blue, and red diamonds. The other shepherd, in red, kneels and looks upwards. An angel with red wings descends from above, holding a scroll with Latin text. The ground is green and dotted with small plants, and several white sheep graze peacefully.",
