    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit, also known as Pentecost. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary is seated, looking towards the viewer's left. To her left, a figure, likely an Apostle, is shown with hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a group of figures, presumably other Apostles, are also depicted with hands raised or clasped. Above them, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light emanating from it. The figures are enclosed within an architectural setting suggested by an arched structure with decorative tracery and a draped canopy. The background shows hints of architectural elements, possibly windows.",
