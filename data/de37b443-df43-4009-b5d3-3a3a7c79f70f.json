The woman on the left, dressed in a pink robe and a white headdress, gestures with her right hand towards the infant. The woman on the right, wearing a blue gown, holds the infant with both arms, looking towards the woman on the left. The background features a richly decorated golden tapestry and green drapery, suggesting an indoor, possibly domestic or royal, setting. The infant appears to be Christ Child, and the woman on the left is likely Saint Anne, while the woman on the right is the Virgin Mary, making this a depiction of the Virgin and Child with Saint Anne.",
