    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures with halos and wings stand against a gold background. The figure on the left is dressed in a white robe with orange horizontal stripes and has orange wings. The figure on the right wears a grey robe with darker stripes and has orange wings. This figure also has large, dark blue, feathered wings behind its head, resembling a dragon's wings or a dark, powerful angelic form. Both figures have their hands raised in a gesture of supplication or greeting. The scene likely depicts a spiritual encounter or a representation of opposing forces, possibly an angel and a demon or a representation of good and evil.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene can be interpreted as a representation of the duality of spiritual forces, possibly depicting an angel and a demon, or a conflict between good and evil. The figure on the left, with its white robe and bright orange wings, embodies purity and divine presence. The figure on the right, with its darker attire and the imposing blue wings, suggests a more ambiguous or potentially malevolent entity. The raised hands could signify a confrontation, a temptation, or a moment of judgment.",
