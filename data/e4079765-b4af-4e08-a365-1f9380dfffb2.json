    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Mark, identifiable by his halo and the act of writing on a scroll, seated within an arched architectural setting. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a golden cloak. To his right, a winged lion, the traditional symbol of Saint Mark, leans forward, appearing to inspire or assist him. The lion is golden and has a furry mane. Behind Saint Mark, a red tapestry with a circular pattern is visible, along with a wooden lectern holding books. The architecture suggests an interior space with arched openings, one of which reveals a glimpse of an outdoor landscape with trees and a blue sky. A small sculpted figure is visible atop a column.",
