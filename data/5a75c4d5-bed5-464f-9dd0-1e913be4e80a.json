    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, adorned with a golden cloak over a white, patterned robe and large, colorful wings, kneels and holds a golden staff. He gestures towards the Virgin Mary, who is seated on the right, dressed in a blue mantle over a golden tunic, with her hands clasped over her chest. Above them, the Holy Spirit is represented by a dove descending from a golden celestial realm. The setting includes architectural elements suggesting a room, with a window visible behind the angel and a richly decorated canopy or bed structure behind Mary. A small open book lies on the floor in front of Mary. The overall scene is framed by a golden arch.",
