    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some with beards and wearing elaborate headwear, are depicted looking upwards with expressions of awe and supplication. One man in the foreground, dressed in blue, gestures with his hands. Another, in yellow, also raises his hands. Behind them, other figures are visible, their faces turned towards the sky. The background features a rich blue tapestry-like pattern, and a stylized representation of a celestial event with radiating lines emanating from a point in the upper right corner. The ground is depicted as a pale green expanse with sparse vegetation. To the far right, a rocky, uneven terrain is suggested with dark, angular forms.",
