    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral landscape dotted with trees and foliage, a knight in full armor kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. A sword is planted in the ground before him. To his right, a horse stands, adorned with a red and gold sash bearing the inscription \"GEORGIUS\". Behind the knight and horse, several figures observe the scene. In the upper left, a bearded figure, likely God, is depicted in a red robe against a golden background, with rays of light emanating downwards. In the distance, a cityscape with numerous towers and spires is visible. A slain beast, possibly a dragon or a wolf, lies on the ground in the foreground, near the knight's helmet.",
