    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, flowing blonde hair, wearing a long, pink gown adorned with gold bands, stands with her arms raised, seemingly pouring water from her sleeves. She is depicted against a deep blue background filled with golden stars and radiating lines, suggesting a celestial or divine setting. Below her, a body of water is rendered with wavy lines, and within it, a baby is cradled in a green, basket-like object. The scene is framed by a green, grassy foreground with yellow plants.",
