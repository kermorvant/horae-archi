    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity seated in glory amidst a celestial host of angels and cherubs. God the Father, an elderly bearded figure in red and white robes, sits to the right, holding a scepter. To his left, Christ, depicted as a youthful figure with wounds on his body, is seated, his arms outstretched. Between them, the Holy Spirit is represented as a dove. Below them, a group of figures, possibly saints or allegorical figures, are gathered. One figure, likely an archangel, holds scales and a sword, suggesting judgment or justice. Other figures hold trumpets and lilies, symbols of resurrection and purity. In the lower part of the image, a landscape with buildings and trees is visible, suggesting a terrestrial realm beneath the divine spectacle.",
