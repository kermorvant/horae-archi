    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely Saint Jerome, is seated in a wooden chair, engrossed in reading a scroll displayed on a lectern. The figure wears a red robe over a white garment. To the right, a lion rests on a patterned floor, and a tall, multi-tiered structure resembling a cabinet or bookshelf stands behind the figure. A small red book is visible within an opening of this structure. A decorative table with a book and a small architectural model of a tower is also present. The background features a green, gold-patterned textile, and the scene is framed by an arched border with floral motifs.",
