    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Adam and Eve standing on either side of a tree bearing red fruit. A serpent, entwined around the tree, offers a fruit to Eve. Behind them, a stylized architectural structure with spires and arches suggests a divine or idealized setting. The figures are nude, signifying their state before the Fall. The overall composition, with its gold leaf background and intricate architectural elements, points to a significant biblical event.",
