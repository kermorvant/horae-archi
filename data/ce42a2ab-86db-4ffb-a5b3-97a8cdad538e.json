    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures stand facing each other, both with halos indicating sainthood. The figure on the left, likely a woman, wears a blue tunic and a red cloak, her hair is long and blonde. The figure on the right, dressed in ecclesiastical vestments including a mitre, holds a staff. They are depicted against a plain blue background, framed by ornamental gold borders. The scene is simple, focusing on the interaction between these two holy figures, suggesting a devotional or narrative moment.",
