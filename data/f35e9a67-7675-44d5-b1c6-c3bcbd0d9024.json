    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a circular frame. On the left, a bearded man with a tonsure and wearing a simple tunic, his hands clasped in prayer or supplication, is positioned beneath a stylized tree with radiating branches. On the right, a larger, bearded figure, also with a halo, stands with his hands outstretched, one open and the other crossed over his chest, as if in a gesture of blessing or communication. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a divine or ethereal presence. This scene is interpreted as David in prayer, with God responding.",
