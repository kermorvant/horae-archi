    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a female saint, identified by her halo, standing and holding a book in her left hand and a pair of forceps or tongs in her right. She is dressed in a long, flowing robe and a mantle. Behind her, an arched architectural element frames the scene, and in the background, a stylized representation of a building with towers is visible. The overall composition suggests a devotional image, likely representing a saint known for her learning and possibly martyrdom, given the presence of the instrument.",
