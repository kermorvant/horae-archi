    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a humble stable, indicated by the wooden structure and the presence of a horse and donkey. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching out. Saint Joseph, in a yellow and blue robe, stands beside them. One of the Magi, dressed in a red and white ermine-trimmed robe, kneels before the child, offering a golden vessel. Other Magi and attendants are gathered, some bearing gifts. In the background, a bustling medieval city with churches and a castle is visible, suggesting the journey's end or a contrast between the humble birth and the worldly realm. A star shines brightly in the sky above the stable.",
