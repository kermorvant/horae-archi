    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with two thieves crucified on either side. Christ is shown with a crown of thorns and a wound in his side, a scroll with Latin text \"VERE FILIVS DEI EST\" (Truly this was the Son of God) is draped across his cross. Below, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, is comforted by other women, one of whom kneels at the base of Christ's cross. To the right, a figure in ornate golden armor, possibly Longinus, the Roman soldier, gazes at Christ, holding a spear. Behind him, a group of soldiers in helmets are visible. In the background, a city with towers and walls is depicted, set against a green landscape and a blue sky with decorative elements at the top border.",
