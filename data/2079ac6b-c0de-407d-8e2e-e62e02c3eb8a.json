    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a baptismal font in an outdoor setting, enclosed by a low stone wall. Two figures are present: one, likely John the Baptist, is on the left, holding a long stick and appearing to direct water from a pipe into the font. The other figure, on the right, kneels and washes their hands in the water flowing from the font. Above the font, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The overall scene suggests a baptismal ritual taking place in a garden or courtyard.",
