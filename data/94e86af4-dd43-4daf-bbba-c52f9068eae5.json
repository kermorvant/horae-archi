    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a skeletal, emaciated figure with a grotesque face on the left, gesturing outwards with its arms. On the right, a young person with pink hair, wearing a blue tunic and red hose, stands with hands raised in a gesture of defense or supplication. The figures are set against a textured gold background, suggesting a divine or otherworldly realm, within an oval frame decorated with floral motifs. The overall composition evokes a confrontation between a demonic entity and a human soul.",
