The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and a wimple, is seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child. The Christ Child is swaddled and has a halo. Joseph walks beside the donkey, carrying a staff over his shoulder. They are traversing a landscape with rolling hills and distant, ruined structures. The sky is a pale blue, and the ground is depicted with patches of green grass and brown earth. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
