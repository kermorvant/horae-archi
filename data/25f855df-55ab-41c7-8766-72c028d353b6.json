    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold patterns, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child who is wrapped in a striped cloth. Saint Joseph, wearing a red tunic and black cloak, walks beside the donkey, holding its reins. An angel with red wings and a pink robe hovers above and to the left, looking down with a serene expression. The background is a vibrant blue sky with golden rays emanating from above, suggesting divine presence, and a stylized green landscape with rolling hills and a small cluster of trees. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sanctity.",
