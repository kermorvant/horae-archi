    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A swaddled infant, identified as Christ, lies on a draped table. To the left, an older man, likely Simeon, holds the child. To the right, the Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, kneels with her hands crossed over her chest, gazing at the infant. Behind her stands another older man, possibly Joseph, holding a basket containing two doves, an offering for the purification ritual. The architectural setting is an interior space with a vaulted ceiling and arched windows, suggesting a temple or church.",
