    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ seated on a throne, draped in a blue robe with intricate gold patterns. His right hand is raised, holding a small object, possibly a wafer, while his left hand rests on his knee. He is surrounded by a golden, scalloped canopy. To his left and right, partially visible figures with beards and halos are present, suggesting they are apostles or saints. The background features a bright blue sky with stylized white clouds, and below Christ, a golden ground with a blue, wavy representation of water or a sea. The entire scene is framed by architectural elements that suggest a divine or heavenly setting.",
