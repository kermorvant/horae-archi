    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude woman with long blonde hair emerges from a body of water, her lower torso submerged. To the right, a king wearing a crown and ermine-trimmed robe gestures outwards from a balcony, accompanied by a richly dressed attendant. Behind them, a grand castle with towers and battlements dominates the background, situated on a hill. The scene appears to depict a narrative event, possibly a royal encounter with a mythical or supernatural being.",
