    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a rocky, outdoor setting with a castle in the background. In the foreground, a man in a blue robe with a halo lies on the ground, seemingly in distress or undergoing an ordeal. Another figure, dressed in a red robe, kneels over him, holding a rosary and appearing to pray or plead. Several other figures stand to the left, observing the scene. The overall impression is one of a dramatic or spiritual event unfolding in a natural landscape, framed by an architectural element on the left.",
