    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling before a figure radiating a halo, who gestures with open hands. To the right, another figure stands with hands clasped in prayer, while a third figure, dressed in white, kneels on a wooden platform, also in prayer. The background is a rolling green landscape dotted with trees and featuring two distant castles on hilltops. The overall impression is one of supplication and divine intervention.",
