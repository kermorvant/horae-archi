    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Jerome in his study, seated on a stool and writing. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a golden cloak, with a quill in his right hand and an inkwell in his left. Beside him sits a lion, a common attribute of Saint Jerome. In the background, through an arched opening, a group of figures in white robes are shown praying before a radiant apparition of the Virgin Mary. To the right, a loggia with three large columns frames a distant landscape with castles and trees under a blue sky. The floor is tiled in a grid pattern.",
