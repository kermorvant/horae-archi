The centaur has a long, grey beard and hair, and is shown drawing a bow. The background features rolling hills, some trees, and distant structures that resemble castles or fortified buildings. The overall scene is rendered with a stylized, somewhat flat perspective typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
