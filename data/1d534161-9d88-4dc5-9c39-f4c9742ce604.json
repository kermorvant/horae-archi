    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by two women. Christ, wearing a blue robe and a red halo, is shown from the waist up, struggling under the weight of a large green cross. To his left, a woman in a red cloak and blue garment, also with a red halo, looks on with a sorrowful expression. Behind her, another woman, partially visible, also appears to be in mourning. To Christ's right, a man in a blue tunic, red cloak, and orange hat, with a halo, walks alongside, holding a hammer in his right hand. The background is a shimmering gold, suggesting a divine or spiritual setting. Above the figures, an architectural frieze with pointed arches and decorative elements frames the scene.",
