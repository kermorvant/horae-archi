    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Catherine of Alexandria, identifiable by her crown and the sword she holds, standing over a defeated male figure who lies prostrate on the floor, also wearing a crown. She is dressed in royal attire, including a blue mantle over a white gown, and is adorned with a golden crown. Two winged figures, likely angels, are positioned behind her, their hands clasped in prayer or reverence. The background features a patterned textile, possibly a tapestry or curtain, with a geometric design of gold, blue, and green squares. The floor is tiled in a red diamond pattern. A broken wheel, a symbol of her martyrdom, is visible to the right of Saint Catherine. The overall setting appears to be an interior space, possibly a throne room or a chamber, suggested by the draped fabric and the tiled floor.",
