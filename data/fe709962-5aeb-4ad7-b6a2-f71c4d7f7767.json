    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female saint, identified by the palm frond she holds and the chalice offered by an angel, stands beside a stone tower. She wears a golden, patterned dress and a red cloak. The angel, with red wings, descends from the upper left, holding the chalice. The background depicts a rolling landscape with trees and distant buildings, suggesting an outdoor setting. The saint's posture and the presence of the palm frond, a symbol of martyrdom, indicate her sanctity. The scene likely represents a moment of divine affirmation or sustenance for the saint.",
