    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Jerome kneeling in a rocky, grassy landscape, looking upwards with a halo around his head. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a pink cloak, and he holds an open book and a quill, appearing to be writing. To his right, a bird, possibly an eagle, stands over a small, dark, demonic figure that is being held by a chain attached to a black object. In the sky above, a vision unfolds: a figure representing God the Father, surrounded by seraphim (red winged figures), is depicted within a celestial mandorla. Descending from this divine vision is an angel, also with wings, holding a child, likely representing the Christ Child, and pointing towards Saint Jerome. In the background, a distant city with towers and a body of water with a boat are visible, suggesting a broader world beyond the immediate scene.",
