    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a ram standing in a natural setting, surrounded by foliage and what appears to be a stylized tree or bush. The ram is shown in profile, with its head turned slightly to the right, revealing its curled horns. The ground is rendered with hatching lines, and there are some floral elements at the bottom. The scene is framed by a decorative border. While no specific religious narrative is immediately apparent, the ram can symbolize Christ, particularly in the context of sacrifice (Agnus Dei), or represent the tribe of Aries in astrological contexts, which could have devotional or symbolic meaning.",
