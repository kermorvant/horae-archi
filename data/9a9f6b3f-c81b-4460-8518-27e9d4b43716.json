    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, is seated on a cushion atop a book. He is gesturing with his right hand towards three young boys who are depicted within a wooden tub. The boys appear to be praying or pleading, with their hands clasped. Behind the bishop, a brick wall with a small window is visible. To the right, a building with arched openings and windows suggests an urban or ecclesiastical setting. The scene likely depicts Saint Nicholas of Myra, a bishop renowned for his miracles, particularly his intervention to save three innocent men from execution and his legendary generosity towards children.",
