    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, with her lying on a richly decorated bed, surrounded by mourners. Two figures, likely apostles, stand on either side of the bed, one on the left in a blue robe and the other on the right in a red robe. A crowd of onlookers is gathered behind them, some with hands clasped in prayer or grief. In the background, a classical architectural setting is suggested with columns and an entablature. Above the scene, a depiction of the Virgin Mary in blue, with hands clasped in prayer and a halo, is shown within an oval frame, possibly representing her ascension or assumption into heaven. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern with decorative elements.",
