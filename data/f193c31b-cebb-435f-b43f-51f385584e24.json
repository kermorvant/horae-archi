    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative initial letter, likely from a medieval manuscript. The initial is filled with intricate vegetal and zoomorphic motifs. A prominent feature is a stylized bird or dragon-like creature with feathered wings and a reptilian body, positioned on the left side of the initial. Its head is raised, with its mouth open, appearing to interact with the surrounding ornamentation. Scattered throughout the design are small human faces, some wearing hoods, emerging from the foliage. The background is a dark, textured field, possibly representing a stylized sky or a rich textile. The overall composition is highly ornamental and symbolic, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
