    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony or vision. On the left, a figure, likely Christ, stands partially obscured by drapery, with his hand raised in blessing. Before him, a kneeling figure in elaborate clerical attire, including a mitre and cope, clasps his hands in prayer while holding an open book. This figure is surrounded by other individuals, some wearing helmets, suggesting a mix of clergy and possibly guards or witnesses. An altar with a chalice and paten is visible in the foreground, indicating a liturgical context. The background features architectural elements suggesting an interior space, possibly a church or chapel.",
