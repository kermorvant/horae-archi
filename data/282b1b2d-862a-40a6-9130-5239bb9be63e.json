    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Archangel Michael, clad in armor and a blue cloak, battling a golden dragon in the sky above a sprawling medieval city. The city is built on a hillside, with a large, imposing castle or cathedral complex dominating the upper slopes. The lower part of the city features densely packed houses with red tiled roofs and timber-framed upper stories. In the foreground, a fortified gatehouse with a rounded arch entrance leads into the city. To the left, a sailing ship is visible near the shore. Four roundels, each containing a bust of an angel with a halo, are placed in the corners of the illumination, radiating golden light.",
