    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Entombment of Christ. Christ's body, pale and marked with wounds, is being laid into a sarcophagus. He is supported by two men, one on his left and one on his right, who are dressed in colorful robes and hats. A woman in a blue mantle, presumably the Virgin Mary, looks on with sorrow, her hands clasped. Another woman, kneeling and dressed in gold and pink, gently touches Christ's hand. In the background, a rolling green landscape is visible, with a path winding through it, and in the distance, a city with a prominent church spire. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded arch.",
