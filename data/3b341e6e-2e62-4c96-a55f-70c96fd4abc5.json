    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an interior space. A central figure, likely a priest, stands before an altar, wearing a blue and gold chasuble, with hands raised in prayer. Two acolytes, also in blue robes, attend to him, one holding a processional cross and the other a torch. Behind them, an altar displays a crucifixion scene with the Virgin Mary and Saint John. Above the altar, a depiction of Christ's resurrected body is shown against a blue, star-patterned background, possibly representing heaven. To the left, a woman in a black habit and wimple observes the proceedings. The floor is tiled in a red and white checkered pattern, and the walls are rendered with architectural details suggesting a church or chapel.",
