    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, wearing a hat and a robe with a circular emblem on the chest, is depicted seated. He has long, wavy hair and a prominent beard. His hands are clasped in his lap. The scene is framed by decorative architectural elements, including what appears to be an arch and columns, with a background filled with a dense pattern of dots and foliage. The overall impression is of a figure of importance, possibly a prophet or a king, within a stylized architectural setting.",
