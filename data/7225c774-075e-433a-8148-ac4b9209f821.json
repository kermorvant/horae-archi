He has a halo and is holding an open book, upon which he appears to be writing with a quill. A staff is held in his other hand, resting on the ground. To his right, a small, tan pig is depicted. The background features a blue sky with some clouds, and a landscape with trees and a body of water. The entire scene is framed by a decorative golden border.",
