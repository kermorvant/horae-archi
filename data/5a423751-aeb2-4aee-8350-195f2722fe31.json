    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a group of figures, primarily focusing on two men in the foreground. The man on the left wears a blue tunic with gold trim and a green cap, while the man next to him is dressed in a purple garment and a reddish-brown cap. Both have beards and are looking to the right. Their lower bodies are visible, showing dark stockings and shoes. The background is a neutral, light color, suggesting an undefined setting. The overall impression is of a narrative scene with multiple participants, though only these two are clearly rendered.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not contain enough iconographic detail to be definitively interpreted as a specific religious or biblical event. It appears to be a depiction of human figures, possibly within a larger narrative context not fully visible.",
