    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a saint or a biblical character, is depicted with a golden halo, suggesting sanctity. The figure is shown in profile, with eyes downcast, engaged in writing or reading from an open book placed before them. They wear a richly patterned garment in red and gold, overlaid with a blue mantle. The background is divided, with a serene blue expanse suggesting water and distant hills on the left, and dark, imposing architectural forms on the right, possibly representing a building or rock formations. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
