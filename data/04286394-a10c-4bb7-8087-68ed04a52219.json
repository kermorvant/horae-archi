    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a halo and wearing a blue mantle, cradles the Christ Child in her arms. She gazes down at him with a gentle expression. Behind them, a brick wall with crenellations suggests a fortified structure, topped by two evergreen trees. The scene is set against a blue sky with radiating lines indicating divine light. The overall composition is framed by an arched border with decorative floral motifs.",
