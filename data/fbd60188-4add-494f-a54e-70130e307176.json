He wears an orange chasuble over a white alb, adorned with gold trim and blue and red circular motifs. He holds a book in his left hand and a grid-like implement, possibly a gridiron, in his right. The background features a blue semi-circle filled with a pattern of golden circles, radiating light, suggesting a divine presence or halo. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern of dark green and black. The scene is framed by a gold border.",
