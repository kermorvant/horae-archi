    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a female saint or noblewoman, is depicted in a bust view, facing left with her head turned slightly towards the viewer. She wears a headdress, a cape draped over her shoulders, and a richly decorated garment with a prominent jeweled pendant. Her right hand points outwards, while her left hand holds a tall, cylindrical object topped with flame, resembling a torch or a candle. The figure is framed by architectural elements that suggest an interior setting, with decorative arches and microarchitecture visible on the sides. Below, a decorative band with intricate patterns further encloses the scene.",
