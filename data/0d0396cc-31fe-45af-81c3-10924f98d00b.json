    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts two figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a figure with a beard and long hair wears a cap and a garment. Their left arm is bent, and their hand is visible. To the right, another figure, also with a long beard and flowing hair, is partially obscured. They are positioned behind a column. The scene is framed by an arch and features decorative elements like dots and foliage. The overall impression is of a religious or historical scene, possibly a biblical narrative or a depiction of saints.",
