    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures moves through a landscape. In the foreground, a woman in a white, gold-trimmed gown and a white turban walks to the left, her hand extended. Behind her, two men play musical instruments: one plays a harp, and the other plays a lute. A third man, further back, blows a horn. The background depicts a hilly landscape with scattered bushes and a distant building. The scene is rendered with a dark, stylized forest on the left and a lighter, more ethereal sky and landscape on the right. The overall impression is one of a celebratory or ceremonial procession.",
