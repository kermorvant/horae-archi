    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded, elderly man, likely a saint, is depicted kneeling and being tormented by three demonic figures. The saint wears a blue robe and a golden cloak, with a rosary around his neck. His halo suggests sanctity. The demons, rendered in red and blue, have monstrous features, horns, and claws, and are shown striking the saint. In the background, a small building with a bell tower and a cross is visible, suggesting a religious setting. The scene likely represents the martyrdom or temptation of a saint by demons.",
