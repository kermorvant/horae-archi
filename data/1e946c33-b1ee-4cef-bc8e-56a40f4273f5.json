    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some kneeling in prayer, look upwards towards a celestial shower of golden rays descending from a starry blue background. In the foreground, a large open red book is displayed, with a golden chalice resting upon it. Several women, dressed in blue and pink robes, stand behind the book, some reaching towards it. The scene is set against a backdrop of a patterned, grid-like texture in shades of blue, red, and gold, suggesting a divine or heavenly space.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a moment of divine revelation or inspiration, possibly related to the Eucharist or a spiritual awakening. The descending rays symbolize divine grace, and the open book with the chalice could represent scripture, divine wisdom, or the sacrament of communion. The presence of both men and women suggests a communal experience of faith.",
