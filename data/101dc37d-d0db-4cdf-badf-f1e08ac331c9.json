Above them, a dove descends from a red canopy, with tongues of fire falling towards the assembled individuals. The architecture is characterized by tall, arched windows with tracery, supported by columns, suggesting a religious interior. A book rests on a wooden lectern in the foreground. This scene is a representation of the Pentecost, where the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and the Virgin Mary.",
