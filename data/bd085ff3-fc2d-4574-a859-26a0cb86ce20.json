    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, depicted with a sorrowful expression, leans on a staff. He wears a yellow tunic and a red scarf around his neck. His right hand rests on his cheek, and his left hand grips the staff. The background features stylized foliage and small, dark, star-like motifs. To the left, a decorative red and gold element, possibly part of a larger border or architectural feature, is visible. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with a hint of green foliage at the bottom suggesting a natural environment. The overall impression is one of grief or contemplation.",
