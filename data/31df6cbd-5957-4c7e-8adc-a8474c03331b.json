    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a raised, cloth-covered surface. A woman in a blue mantle, presumably the Virgin Mary, stands to the left, looking down. To her right, a man with a beard, possibly Joseph, leans forward. Another man, also bearded, stands behind them. In the center, the Christ Child, with a halo, is held by a man in a green robe and red sleeves, who appears to be a bishop or a priest, indicated by his white headdress. The figures are positioned on a red tiled floor. The background is a textured gold leaf, suggesting a divine or ethereal setting. The scene likely represents the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, a significant event in Christian liturgy and devotion.",
