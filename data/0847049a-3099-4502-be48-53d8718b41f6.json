    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel in full armor, with wings outstretched, standing over a defeated dragon. He holds a sword aloft in his right hand, poised to strike, and a shield in his left. Below him, a fallen figure, possibly representing humanity or a defeated foe, lies prostrate. The background features architectural elements that suggest a stylized, perhaps heavenly, setting, with decorative arches and pinnacles.",
