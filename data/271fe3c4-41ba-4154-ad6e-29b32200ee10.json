    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, kneeling and holding a scroll inscribed with Hebrew text, addressing the Virgin Mary on the right. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, looking towards the angel. She is positioned near a lectern with an open book and a red book placed on a shelf. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by a brick wall and a diamond-paned window in the background. A vase with white lilies, a symbol of purity, is placed between the two figures. The background is richly decorated with gold patterns on a pinkish-red fabric.",
