    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowd of people looking up towards a raised platform where a man, identified as Christ, stands bound and partially undressed, wearing a loincloth. Beside him, a figure in a blue robe and a distinctive red and yellow hat gestures towards Christ. The architectural setting is a stone structure with a railing and steps, suggesting a public presentation or judgment. In the background, a stylized cityscape with towers and hills is visible under a blue sky. The crowd's expressions and gestures indicate engagement with the unfolding event, likely a moment of accusation or condemnation.",
