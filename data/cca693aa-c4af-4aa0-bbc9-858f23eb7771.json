    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a hellish landscape with multiple green-skinned demons tormenting naked human souls. In the center, a large demon sits astride a cauldron filled with suffering souls, holding a staff. To the left, two demons stand over two souls who appear to be bound or chained. To the right, another demon stands near two souls who are hanging, seemingly from an unseen structure. The ground is engulfed in flames and smoke, indicative of hellish torment. The overall impression is one of suffering, punishment, and demonic cruelty.",
