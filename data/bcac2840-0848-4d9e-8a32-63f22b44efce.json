    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded, elderly man, likely a prophet or saint, stands in a landscape. He wears a blue tunic and a reddish-brown cloak lined with gold. He holds a golden staff in his right hand and his left hand is raised, gesturing. The background depicts rolling green hills with stylized trees, and a blue sky with distant, indistinct structures. The figure has a halo, indicating his sanctity. The scene is rendered with vibrant colors and gold leaf, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
