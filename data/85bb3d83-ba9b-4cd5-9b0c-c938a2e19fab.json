    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a walled city with a prominent church spire, set against a blue, undulating landscape. Trees with gold foliage frame the view on the left and right. In the foreground, a small boat with a single occupant navigates a body of water. The city itself features several buildings, including what appears to be a central church with a tall spire, surrounded by other structures and fortifications. The overall impression is one of a serene, perhaps idealized, urban setting.",
