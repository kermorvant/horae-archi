    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a kneeling figure, possibly a supplicant, extending their hands towards a bearded man who is also reaching out. Behind the bearded man stand two other figures, observing the interaction. To the left, another figure is visible, seemingly gesturing towards a small animal, perhaps a lamb, which is also present. The background features architectural elements, including a tower-like structure with windows, suggesting an urban or fortified setting. The overall composition is framed by an arch, indicative of a decorative border or architectural element within the manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of supplication or petition, possibly within a biblical narrative or a devotional context. The kneeling figure could be seeking favor or forgiveness, while the bearded man might be an authority figure or a saint. The presence of the animal could allude to a sacrifice or a specific biblical event involving an animal.",
