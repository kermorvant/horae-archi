    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a saint or martyr, lying down and appearing to be in distress or undergoing torment. A sword is prominently displayed, piercing or held near the figure's body. To the right, a smaller, demonic figure with pointed ears and a hunched posture seems to be involved in the torment. Above, stylized foliage and a starry sky suggest an outdoor or possibly a celestial setting. The overall impression is one of suffering and divine judgment or intervention.",
