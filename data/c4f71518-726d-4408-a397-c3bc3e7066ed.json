    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, veiled and in a blue robe adorned with gold, presents the Christ Child, who lies naked on a white cloth atop a stone altar. Behind Mary stands a woman, possibly Saint Anne, and a bearded man, likely Saint Joseph. To the right, a figure in a jeweled mitre and ornate robes, representing a high priest, gazes at the child. The background suggests an interior space with architectural elements like columns and a draped canopy, hinting at a sacred setting within a temple or church.",
