    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, identified as Saint George by his attributes, stands in a rocky, hilly landscape dotted with stylized trees. He wears a long, grey monastic-like robe with yellow trim and a helmet adorned with a blue crest. In his left hand, he holds a book, and in his right, a golden staff or sword. The figure is depicted in a devotional pose, possibly in prayer or contemplation, set against a pale blue sky. The overall scene suggests a saintly figure in a natural, albeit stylized, environment.",
