    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, with two central figures appearing to embrace or greet each other. One figure is clad in a blue robe and a red undergarment, while the other wears a yellow-gold robe and a grey mantle. Behind them, a third figure with a darker complexion and a red garment is visible, looking downwards. To the left, another figure in a red garment and head covering is partially visible. The background is indistinct, but suggests an interior setting with some architectural elements, possibly a wall or drapery. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene, likely depicting a biblical event or a saintly encounter, given the context of a Book of Hours.",
