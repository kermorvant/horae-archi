    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman, likely Bathsheba, bathing in a square, ornate fountain or pool. She is partially submerged in the water, holding a cloth or garment. To the left, another woman, possibly a servant or attendant, is seated and looking towards the bather. In the background, a building with a pitched roof and what appears to be a tower or turret is visible, set against a green, hilly landscape. Above and to the left, a figure in a red and blue hat is looking down from a balcony or upper level, observing the scene. The overall setting is outdoors, with elements of architecture and lush greenery.",
