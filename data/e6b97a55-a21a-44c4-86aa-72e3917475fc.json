    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and carrying the cross, walking on a rocky path. He is accompanied by a group of figures, including the Virgin Mary, who appears distressed, and several soldiers in armor. Behind them, a fortified city with towers and crenellated walls is visible, suggesting the procession is moving towards a place of execution. The overall composition is framed by an ornate arch, typical of manuscript illumination.",
