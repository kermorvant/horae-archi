    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely Saint Francis, stands in a verdant landscape. He wears a dark, hooded robe cinched with a rope belt, and his bare feet are visible. His hands are outstretched, palms up, in a gesture of offering or blessing. The background depicts rolling hills rendered in earthy tones, dotted with stylized trees and foliage. The upper portion of the image features a textured gold leaf, suggesting a divine or celestial presence. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
