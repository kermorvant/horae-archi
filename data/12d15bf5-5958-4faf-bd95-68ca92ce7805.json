    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble architectural setting, possibly a stable. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Beside her, a newborn Christ Child lies in a manger. An elderly man, likely Joseph, stands to the left, holding a candle. Two angels are present: one in a golden robe with orange wings kneels and gestures towards the child, while another in a white robe stands with hands clasped in prayer. In the background, through an arched opening, a wooden structure with a thatched roof is visible, suggesting an outdoor or semi-outdoor space. Animals, including a donkey and an ox, are present in the foreground, lying down.",
