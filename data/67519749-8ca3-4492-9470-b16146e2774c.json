    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely King David, kneeling in prayer. He wears a jeweled crown and ornate robes, with his hands clasped in supplication. To his left is a large, gilded wooden chest. To his right, a golden harp stands upright, and a grey, pointed object, possibly a discarded weapon or shield, lies on the blue tiled floor. In the background, a richly decorated blue tapestry hangs, and above it, a series of Gothic windows with tracery are visible. To the far right, a figure, possibly a prophet or an angel, is shown in an arched opening, holding a golden orb and gesturing upwards, with rays of light descending. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
