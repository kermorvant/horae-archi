    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity. On the left, God the Father, with a beard and halo, points upwards with his right hand and holds an open book with his left. To his right, Christ, also with a beard and halo, holds a golden orb in his left hand. Above them, the Holy Spirit is represented as a white dove with outstretched wings and a halo, descending from a radiant source. Both figures are seated on blue clouds, and the background is a deep blue with scattered gold motifs. The figures are draped in rich, flowing robes, with God the Father in a red mantle over a grey tunic, and Christ in a grey tunic and a red mantle. The open book suggests divine knowledge or scripture.",
