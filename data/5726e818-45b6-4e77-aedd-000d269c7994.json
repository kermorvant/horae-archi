    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, including the Virgin Mary in the foreground with hands clasped in prayer, and several male figures behind her, all with halos. The Virgin Mary is dressed in a blue mantle over an orange tunic. The male figures are clad in green garments and red drapery. Behind them, a window reveals a blue landscape with a castle-like structure. From the window, a white dove descends, emitting golden rays and fiery tongues that extend towards the figures. The background is a grey wall with decorative motifs. This scene represents the Pentecost, where the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and the Virgin Mary, empowering them with divine gifts.",
