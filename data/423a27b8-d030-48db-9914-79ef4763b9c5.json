    "scene_description_enriched": "A knight in full armor, wearing a white surcoat with a red cross, rides a pink horse. The knight's helmet is pointed, and he wears a blue coif. The horse is adorned with red trappings and a decorative bridle. The knight holds a lance, and his legs are clad in white greaves. He appears to be in the process of a joust or battle, with a stylized, possibly monstrous, form beneath the horse's hooves. The background features a dark, patterned fabric and decorative borders, suggesting an illuminated manuscript page.",
