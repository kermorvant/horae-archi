    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women standing outside a building with a barred window. The woman on the left wears a blue robe and holds a dark, lidded vessel. The woman on the right wears a red dress and carries a basket. Behind the bars of the window, a person with a beard and wearing a red garment is visible. The background is a simple green landscape under a purple sky, framed by decorative blue and gold foliage. This scene likely represents the Visitation, with Mary and Elizabeth meeting, and the figure behind bars possibly alluding to a confinement or a symbolic representation of a spiritual state.",
