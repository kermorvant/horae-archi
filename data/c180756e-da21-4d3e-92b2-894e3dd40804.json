    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a beard and long hair, appearing to be naked or lightly draped, seated on a raised surface. An angel with large wings stands behind him, placing a hand on his head. The figures are framed by an arched architectural element. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a celestial or ethereal setting. The man's posture and the angel's gesture evoke a sense of comfort, protection, or perhaps a divine blessing.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely a depiction of the Baptism of Christ, where John the Baptist (represented by the man) is being baptized by Jesus, or conversely, Jesus being baptized by John. However, the typical iconography of the Baptism of Christ usually shows Jesus standing in water and John the Baptist pouring water. Another interpretation could be Christ in Limbo, where Christ descends to rescue the righteous souls from hell, with an angel present. Given the limited detail, it's difficult to definitively identify the specific event, but it relates to a significant moment in Christ's life or a related theological concept.",
