    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pentecost, with the Virgin Mary seated centrally, hands clasped in prayer, surrounded by the Apostles. Above them, the Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove, radiating golden rays of light. The figures are gathered within a vaulted architectural space, suggested by the arches and windows visible in the background. The Apostles are shown with halos, some looking upwards in awe, while one holds a book. The overall impression is one of divine inspiration and communal prayer.",
