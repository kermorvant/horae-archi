    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in an outdoor setting with architectural elements. In the foreground, a woman in a blue mantle and a man in a red hat and blue cloak stand together, seemingly in conversation. To the right, a woman in a blue gown and crown kneels on a set of stairs, her hands clasped in prayer, looking towards an opening. Within this opening, a figure in a yellow habit and orange hat stands, holding a book or tablet. Behind the foreground figures, a stone wall separates them from a complex of buildings with pitched roofs and a prominent tower with a golden roof. The overall scene suggests a devotional or narrative moment, possibly related to a biblical event or a saint's life, given the praying figure and the presence of a religious figure within an architectural structure.",
