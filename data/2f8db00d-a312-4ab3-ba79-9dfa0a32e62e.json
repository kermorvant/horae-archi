    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in a blue tunic and red cloak, with a beard and a halo, looking upwards with his hands raised in supplication. He holds a staff. Above him, an angelic figure with wings, also with a halo, is depicted in white garments, with hands clasped in prayer. The background is a vibrant blue sky, and a hint of architectural structure, possibly an arch, is visible at the top. To the right of the man, a white, fluffy sheep is depicted, facing towards the viewer. The overall impression is one of divine intervention or prayer.",
