Facing the angel are three women, also with veiled heads, who are holding cups. The background suggests a cityscape with buildings and structures, possibly indicating an urban or religious environment. The overall composition suggests a devotional scene, likely related to a biblical narrative or a saint's life, where figures are engaged in a ritual or offering.",
