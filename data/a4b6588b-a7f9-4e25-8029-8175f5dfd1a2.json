    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, stands in a landscape with a city in the background. She is depicted with a veil covering her head and draped over her shoulders, and she wears a long, flowing gown. Her hands are clasped or held near her chest, and her gaze is directed downwards with a somber expression. The background features stylized buildings with towers and arched windows, suggesting an urban setting. The foreground shows some foliage and rocky terrain. The overall composition evokes a sense of contemplation or sorrow, possibly related to the Passion of Christ or a moment of personal grief.",
