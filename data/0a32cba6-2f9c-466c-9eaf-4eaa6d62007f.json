    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted in prayer, her hands clasped and holding a cross. She wears a blue mantle over a pink garment, both adorned with gold. She is flanked by two green, dragon-like creatures. Behind her, architectural elements suggest an interior space with columns and red drapery. The scene is framed by a golden border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of the Virgin Mary, the cross, and the defeated dragons strongly suggests the iconography of the Immaculate Conception or a representation of the Virgin triumphing over evil, often symbolized by serpents or dragons.",
