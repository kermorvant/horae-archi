    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession of three skeletal figures, representing Death, confronting a group of living individuals. On the left, two men are shown on horseback. One man, dressed in blue and white striped attire and a conical hat, gestures towards the skeletal figures. Behind him, another man, partially obscured, appears to be holding a third, possibly deceased or injured, individual. In the background, a fortified tower and a tall, spired building suggest a town or city setting. The overall scene is framed by an ornate, illuminated border. This imagery is a visual representation of the Dance of Death, a medieval allegorical motif emphasizing the universality of death and the transient nature of life.",
