    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a hermit or saint, kneels in prayer with his hands clasped and eyes raised towards the sky. He is dressed in a dark, ornate robe. Behind him, a decorative fence separates him from a courtyard where a bird stands. In the background, several buildings are depicted, including a prominent house with a stepped gable and multiple windows. The scene is set outdoors, with a suggestion of a cloudy sky.",
