    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, kneels in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies on a blue cloth. Rays of golden light descend from above, illuminating the infant. To the left, an elderly man, likely Saint Joseph, also kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a donkey and an ox are visible, their heads near a woven manger. In the background, two figures in hooded robes observe the scene, and a brick wall forms the rear of the stable. The setting is rustic, with wooden beams and a thatched roof structure.",
