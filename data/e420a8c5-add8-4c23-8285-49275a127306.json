Below, in a green, hilly landscape dotted with trees, two shepherds are depicted. One shepherd, wearing a red cloak and a straw hat, points towards the angel. The other shepherd, cloaked in yellow and blue, appears to be tending to a flock of three sheep. In the background, a fortified structure, possibly a castle or tower, is visible on a distant hill.",
