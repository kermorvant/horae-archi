    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pentecost, with the Virgin Mary seated centrally, hands clasped in prayer over an open book. She is surrounded by a group of figures, some looking upwards with expressions of awe and wonder, others gesturing. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by colorful columns and a vaulted ceiling. Above the central architectural element, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, is depicted with outstretched wings. The floor is tiled in a geometric pattern. The overall impression is one of divine inspiration and communal spiritual experience.",
