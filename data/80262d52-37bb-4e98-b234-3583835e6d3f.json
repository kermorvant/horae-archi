    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame adorned with foliage, an angel with large wings is depicted bending over to touch a figure seated on the right. The angel holds a staff or scepter. The seated figure, an elderly man with a beard and wearing a turban-like headdress, looks towards the angel. To the left of the angel, partially obscured, are two other figures, one appearing to be a woman with a veiled head and another person. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the Visitation, where Mary (represented by the veiled figure) visits her cousin Elizabeth. The angel's presence and the interaction suggest a divine or miraculous event. Alternatively, it could represent a scene from the Old Testament or a hagiographic narrative involving an angel and human figures.",
