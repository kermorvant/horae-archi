    "scene_description_enriched": "A monkey, seated and facing left, holds a round, orange object in its hands, appearing to examine or eat it. The monkey is depicted with grey fur and wears a red band around its waist. The setting is an outdoor landscape under a starry blue sky. The ground is barren and rocky, with sparse, thin, leafless trees or branches. The scene is framed by an ornamental border featuring colorful circular motifs.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents an allegorical or symbolic depiction, possibly related to folly, sin, or the temptation of worldly pleasures, given the common medieval association of monkeys with such themes. Without further context from the manuscript, a specific biblical or devotional event cannot be identified.",
