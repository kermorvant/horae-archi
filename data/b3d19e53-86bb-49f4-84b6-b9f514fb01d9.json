    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching towards a figure in a pink robe and a red hat, presumably a priest. To the left, a woman in an orange dress holds a basket containing doves. The background is a patterned textile, and the figures are positioned in front of a raised, draped structure that likely represents an altar or a ceremonial platform. The overall impression is one of solemnity and religious observance.",
