    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint, is depicted kneeling. She holds a palm frond in her left hand and a model of a tower in her right. The figure wears a long, draped garment and has long, wavy hair. She is framed by an arched architectural element above and a textured background that suggests foliage or a patterned cloth. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong hatching for shading. The presence of the palm frond signifies martyrdom, and the tower is a common attribute for saints associated with fortifications or imprisonment, such as Saint Barbara.",
