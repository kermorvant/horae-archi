    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and with a halo, kneels before a golden, ornate altar-like structure. She reaches out to receive the Christ Child, who is held by an elderly man with a white beard and a blue, star-patterned hat, dressed in a red cloak over golden armor. Behind the Virgin Mary stand two women, one in a red robe holding a basket, and another in a blue hood. Behind the man holding the child are two other men, one in a red cap and the other in a blue garment. The background shows a window with diamond-shaped panes, suggesting an indoor setting. The overall scene is framed by an arched architectural element with decorative motifs.",
