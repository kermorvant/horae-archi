    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely Christ, seated on a golden orb or throne, with arms outstretched. To the left, a woman in a blue robe, possibly the Virgin Mary, looks towards the central figure. To the right, another figure, perhaps a saint or prophet, kneels with hands clasped in prayer. In the foreground, two infants are shown, one reaching out. The background is a gradient of blue, suggesting a celestial or ethereal setting, framed by a decorative blue border with red and gold accents.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Ascension of Christ, with the Virgin Mary and other figures witnessing his ascent into heaven. The infants in the foreground could symbolize souls or the innocent faithful.",
