The Virgin Mary, with a halo, kneels in prayer to the left, her blue mantle draped over a blue tunic. Beside her, a donkey and an ox are present. In the center, the Christ Child lies on the ground, radiating a golden halo. To the right, Saint Joseph, also with a halo, kneels in prayer, wearing a blue cloak over a grey tunic. The background shows a green, hilly landscape with stylized trees and a distant city with towers and spires. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
