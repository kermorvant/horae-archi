    "scene_description_enriched": "A young person with dark, curly hair is depicted with their hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards with a pained or supplicating expression. They wear a white undergarment, a yellow tunic with red trim, and blue sleeves. The figure is framed by ornate, gilded architectural elements on the left and right, suggesting an interior space. Through an opening, a landscape with trees and a blue sky is visible, with a pale, grand building in the background. The overall impression is one of devotion or lament.",
