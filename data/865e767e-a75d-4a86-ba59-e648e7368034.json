    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men gathered together. One central figure, wearing a hat, appears to be speaking or gesturing. He is surrounded by several other men, some of whom are kneeling. The figures are rendered in a stylized, woodcut-like manner. Above them, an arched architectural element frames the scene, suggesting an interior or a structured setting. The background behind the figures is filled with a dense pattern of dots, possibly representing a tapestry or a decorative wall.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is too generic to definitively interpret as a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional event without further context. It could represent a council, a gathering of disciples, or a scene from a saint's life. However, the presence of multiple figures in discussion or supplication is common in various narrative cycles.",
