    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female saint, identified by her red hair and the palm frond she holds, stands within an arched architectural frame. She is dressed in a white tunic with a fur-trimmed collar and a blue mantle adorned with gold stripes, draped over a pink cloak. She holds an open green book in her hands, her gaze directed downwards. Behind her, a rocky landscape with green foliage is visible on the left, while a cylindrical tower with arched openings and a crenellated top stands on the right, suggesting a fortified or ecclesiastical setting. The scene is framed by decorative golden arches and borders, typical of a Book of Hours illumination.",
