    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth. To the left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, with her hands clasped in sorrow. To the right is a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also with clasped hands, dressed in a red robe. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills is visible, leading to a city with prominent buildings, including a domed structure and spires. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with foliate motifs and gold ornamentation.",
