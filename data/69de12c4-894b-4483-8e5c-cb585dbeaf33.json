    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King David kneeling outdoors, looking upwards with his hand to his face, as if in prayer or contemplation. He is richly dressed in a red cloak lined with ermine and a blue tunic, and wears a crown. He holds a harp, and a small bottle lies on the ground beside him. In the upper part of the image, a divine figure, likely God the Father, appears in a cloud, blessing David with a raised hand and holding a globe. Behind David, a landscape unfolds with rocky outcrops, lush green trees, and in the distance, a walled city with towers and spires. The overall scene suggests a moment of divine inspiration or communication with the Almighty.",
