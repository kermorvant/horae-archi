    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded men stand in a grassy landscape with a river and distant buildings. The man on the left wears a golden robe and a patterned cap, holding a scroll that unfurls with the inscription \"Plagas.\" The man on the right wears a blue robe and holds a scroll with the inscription \"Firmas.\" Both figures have scrolls that appear to be part of their garments or are held in a way that suggests they are speaking or proclaiming. In the background, a body of water with boats is visible, along with a city or settlement and a domed structure with spires. The overall scene evokes a sense of prophecy or divine pronouncement.",
