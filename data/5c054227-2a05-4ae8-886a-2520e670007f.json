    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a female saint, identifiable by her halo, seated outdoors in a pastoral landscape. She wears a white veil and a red robe over a blue skirt, and holds a staff with a tuft of straw. Three pigs are visible in the foreground, grazing in a grassy area near trees. In the background, a fortified castle with towers and battlements is situated on a hill. Above, in a golden celestial sphere, a bearded figure, likely God the Father, blesses the scene with rays of light descending. The overall composition suggests a narrative of a saint's life or patronage, possibly related to agriculture or animal husbandry, set against a backdrop of a fortified settlement and divine presence.",
