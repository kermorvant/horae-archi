    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity in a symbolic representation of the Crucifixion. God the Father, depicted as an elderly man with a papal tiara and halo, holds the crucified Christ. The Holy Spirit is represented by a dove, positioned between God the Father and Christ. Christ is shown on the cross, with wounds visible. The figures are set against a blue, gold-patterned background, with architectural elements suggesting a divine or heavenly space. To the left, columns and a partial entablature are visible, hinting at a classical or sacred architectural setting. The overall composition is framed by decorative borders typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
