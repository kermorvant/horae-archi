A goat leaps onto a rocky outcrop. In the background, a city with classical architecture, including domes and spires, is visible. Above, in a cloudy sky, God the Father appears, surrounded by cherubic angels, with flames emanating from a bush in the middle ground. The divine presence signifies the divine revelation to Moses.",
