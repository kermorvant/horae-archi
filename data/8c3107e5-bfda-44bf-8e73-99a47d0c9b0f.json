    "scene_description_enriched": "A young woman, likely Saint Barbara, is depicted seated outdoors in a landscape. She wears a pink tunic and a blue, gold-patterned skirt. In her right hand, she holds a palm frond, a symbol of martyrdom, and in her left, a book. Behind her, rolling hills and trees are visible under a pale blue sky. To the right of the scene, a decorative architectural element, possibly a gilded column with intricate tracery, frames the composition. The overall impression is one of serene contemplation and religious devotion.",
