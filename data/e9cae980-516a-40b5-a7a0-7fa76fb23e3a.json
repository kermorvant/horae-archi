    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures, two of whom are identifiable as Christ and Saint John the Baptist by their halos, are depicted walking outdoors on a path. The central figure, likely Christ, wears a simple tunic and hat, while the figure to his right, possibly Saint John, also wears a tunic and hat and carries a staff. The figure to Christ's left, with a hood covering his head and a staff, appears to be an older companion. They are walking through a landscape with trees and rocks, and in the background, a fortified city with towers and walls is visible. The scene is framed by a gold border with floral motifs, typical of a Book of Hours illumination.",
