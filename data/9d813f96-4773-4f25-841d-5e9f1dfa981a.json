    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the body of Christ being held by a figure, possibly Joseph of Arimathea, while another figure, likely the Virgin Mary, kneels in sorrow. Other figures are present, including one standing behind Christ and another to the right, possibly a disciple or follower. The figures are rendered in a stylized, woodcut-like manner. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an archway, suggesting an interior or a symbolic architectural setting. The overall composition conveys a sense of grief and reverence.",
