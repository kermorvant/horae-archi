    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of Christ, rendered with a golden halo and rays emanating from his head, set against a gold background. He is shown with long, wavy brown hair and a beard, and his right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing, with two fingers extended. His left hand holds an orb surmounted by a cross, symbolizing his dominion over the world. Christ is clothed in a red mantle over a dark blue tunic, with a turquoise sash draped across his chest. The scene is framed by an arched border with blue cloud-like motifs and decorative gold patterns at the top and bottom.",
