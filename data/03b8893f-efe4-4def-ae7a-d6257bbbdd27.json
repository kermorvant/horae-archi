    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a decorative border element featuring a grotesque creature with a human-like face, a hooded head, and the body of a quadruped with clawed feet. The creature is rendered in black ink on a light background, with stylized lines indicating fur or feathers. The overall composition suggests an ornamental motif rather than a narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is a decorative element, likely a grotesque or foliate initial, used to embellish a manuscript. Grotesques were common in medieval art and served decorative, symbolic, or even apotropaic functions, often representing the chaotic or monstrous forces that divine order overcomes.",
