    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a battlefield encampment with numerous tents set up on a hilly landscape. In the foreground, several soldiers in armor lie fallen, some appearing wounded or dead. Two armored figures stand prominently: one on the left holds a banner, while the figure on the right, also armored, appears to be tending to a wounded or deceased individual lying within a tent. The background shows more tents, trees, and figures in the distance, with a rocky outcrop topped by two figures. The overall impression is one of a military camp after a battle, possibly during a campaign.",
