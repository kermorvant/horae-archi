    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a fortified structure with a red brick tower on the left and a grey stone wall with battlements. A knight in full armor, holding a halberd, stands guard outside the wall. To the right, within a barred opening of the wall, a young woman in a blue dress with a halo is shown praying. She is facing a monstrous, red-skinned creature with horns and sharp teeth, possibly a demon, which is also behind the bars. The woman holds a golden cross. Two birds are perched on the battlements, and a lizard is visible on the wall.",
