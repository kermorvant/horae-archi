    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a meeting between three men outside a fortified building complex. On the left, two men, one in a red robe and the other in a blue robe with gold trim, are interacting with a third man who is being led forward. The man in the blue robe has a long white beard and is being embraced or guided by the man in red. The third man, in a gold robe, is facing towards the right and appears to be shaking hands with another man who stands on a raised platform. This second man, dressed in a red tunic and gold robe, is positioned within an arched doorway. Behind them, a complex of buildings with pitched roofs, towers, and crenellated walls is visible against a starry blue sky. The overall impression is one of a formal or significant encounter taking place within or near a city or castle.",
