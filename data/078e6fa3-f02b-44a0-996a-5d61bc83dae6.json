    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a close-up of Christ on the cross. His body is emaciated and marked with wounds, including the stigmata on his hands and feet (partially visible) and a significant wound in his side from which blood flows. A golden halo surrounds his head, and golden rays emanate from it. The cross itself is wooden, and there is an inscription in gold lettering on the crossbeam. The background is a dark, textured void, suggesting a metaphysical or spiritual setting.",
