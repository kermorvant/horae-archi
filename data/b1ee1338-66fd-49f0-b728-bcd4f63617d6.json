    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the arrest of Christ, with Jesus in the center being seized by soldiers. He wears a purple robe adorned with gold patterns and has a golden halo. Around him, various figures are shown: some are grabbing him, others are looking on with concern or aggression. To the left, a man in a yellow tunic is kneeling and appears distressed, reaching out with one hand. In the background, a city with numerous towers and spires is visible, nestled on rolling green hills. To the right, a stone archway leads to a path where more figures are walking, and beyond that, a mountainous landscape under a blue sky. The overall impression is one of turmoil and the beginning of Christ's Passion.",
