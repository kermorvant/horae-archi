    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two sections by an ornate architectural frame. On the left, a figure, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted seated beneath a tree, with her hands raised in a gesture of surprise or contemplation. An angel, possibly Gabriel, hovers above her, holding an open book. The background is a starry sky. On the right, another angel, also with wings and holding a book, appears to be descending or speaking. The overall impression is one of a divine visitation or revelation, set against a celestial backdrop.",
