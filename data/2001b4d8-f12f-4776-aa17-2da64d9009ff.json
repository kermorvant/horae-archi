    "scene_description_enriched": "A solitary figure, likely Saint Andrew, stands draped in a golden robe and a blue mantle, holding a large, X-shaped cross. The figure has a halo and a sorrowful expression, looking down. In their other hand, they hold a small red book. The scene is set within an architectural structure featuring arched openings and columns, suggesting a loggia or cloister. Beyond the architecture, a landscape with hills and distant buildings is visible under a blue sky. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern. The overall impression is one of contemplation and devotion, with the cross symbolizing martyrdom and the book representing scripture or theological study.",
