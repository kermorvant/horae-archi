    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central object. A man with a beard, wearing a conical hat and ornate robes, stands on the left, holding a baby. To the right, a woman in a veil holds the baby, while another woman stands behind her. Two other figures are visible behind the man. The figures are positioned in front of a stone structure that resembles a sarcophagus or altar, with decorative carvings. Above them, an arched architectural element frames the scene, adorned with foliage motifs. The overall impression is of a religious or ceremonial event, possibly related to the presentation or adoration of a child.",
