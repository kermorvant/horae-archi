    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an angel with large wings extending from its back, reaching towards a seated figure. The angel's right arm is bent, and its hand is extended, possibly offering something or in a gesture of blessing. The seated figure, likely a woman, is dressed in a long robe and wears a headdress. She is looking towards the angel and appears to be holding something in her lap. Behind the figures, a stylized tree with leaves is visible, and the background is filled with a stippled pattern. The entire composition is framed by decorative, scrolling elements that suggest an ornamental border or initial.",
