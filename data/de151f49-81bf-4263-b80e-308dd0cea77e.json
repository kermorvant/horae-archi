    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a nude woman seated in a tub, with two men standing on either side of her. The woman has her hands placed over her breasts. The man on the left wears a cap and a robe, and his left hand is reaching towards the woman. The man on the right wears a helmet-like cap and a robe, and his right hand is also reaching towards the woman. Behind the figures, an arched architectural element is visible, decorated with a patterned background. The overall impression is of a ritualistic or medical procedure, possibly related to bathing or purification.",
