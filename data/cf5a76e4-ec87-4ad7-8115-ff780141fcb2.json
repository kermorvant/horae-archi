    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a stylized scene with human figures and decorative elements. On the left, a figure with a head and outstretched hand is visible, possibly in a gesture of supplication or surprise. To the right, another figure is shown in a reclining or struggling posture, with limbs contorted. The scene is framed by swirling, organic forms that resemble foliage or waves, and at the far right, a creature that appears to be a dragon or serpent is depicted. The overall impression is one of dramatic action or a symbolic representation of conflict or struggle, possibly within a natural or fantastical setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene's interpretation is uncertain due to the abstract and stylized nature of the depiction. The figures and the dragon-like creature could represent a biblical narrative, a hagiographic event, or a more general allegorical theme of good versus evil, or struggle against adversity. Without further context or clearer iconography, a definitive interpretation is not possible.",
