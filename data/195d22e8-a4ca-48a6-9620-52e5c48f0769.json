    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a celestial setting. Rays of golden light descend from a blue sky dotted with golden clouds onto a red, patterned ground. In the foreground, several individuals are shown. One figure, wearing a golden robe and a crown, clutches their head, seemingly in distress or contemplation. To their left, a figure in a blue robe with golden trim gestures with raised hands, while another figure in a green robe also has hands raised in prayer or supplication. A figure in a brown robe leans on a wooden staff, pointing towards the ground. The overall impression is one of divine intervention or judgment.",
