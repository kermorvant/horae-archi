    "scene_description_enriched": "A small, reddish-brown deer is depicted lying down in a landscape setting. The deer is facing left, with its head turned slightly upwards. Its ears are erect, and its body is relaxed. The background consists of rolling hills and sparse, bare trees, suggesting a winter or barren season. The scene is framed by an ornamental border with colorful jewels and foliage.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The deer, particularly when depicted in a resting or vulnerable pose, can symbolize various concepts in medieval art, including purity, innocence, and Christ. In some contexts, it can also represent the soul seeking solace or refuge. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or devotional event is not clearly identifiable, but the imagery evokes themes of nature and spiritual contemplation.",
