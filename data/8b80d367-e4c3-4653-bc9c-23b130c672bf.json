    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a prophet or apostle, stands within a decorative architectural frame. He is depicted in profile, facing left, with a scroll unfurled in his left hand and a stylus or quill in his right, suggesting he is in the act of writing or dictating. He wears a blue tunic and a red mantle draped over his shoulders and body. The background behind him is a rich, textured gold leaf, indicative of a divine or sacred context. The architectural elements framing the figure are stylized and appear to be part of a larger, ornate structure, possibly a niche or a tabernacle, with decorative motifs in red, green, and gold. The overall impression is one of solemnity and spiritual contemplation.",
