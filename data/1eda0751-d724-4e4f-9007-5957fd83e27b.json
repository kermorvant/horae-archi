    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, all with golden halos, gathered together. Above them, a divine light emanates from a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, with rays descending and transforming into tongues of fire that alight upon each individual. The figures are depicted in various poses of prayer and contemplation, with some kneeling and others seated or standing. The setting is a simple, earthy ground beneath a blue sky, suggesting an outdoor or perhaps a symbolic, unadorned space. The overall composition conveys a moment of divine inspiration and spiritual descent.",
