    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude figure, possibly representing a woman, is depicted in a seated or reclining position. She has long, wavy hair and is partially covered by drapery. The background features foliage, possibly vines with grapes, and a textured pattern that could represent a wall or fabric. The figure appears to be emerging from or interacting with a patterned surface that resembles water or a woven mat. The overall composition is framed by decorative elements at the top and sides, suggesting an ornamental border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene's interpretation is uncertain due to the lack of clear iconographic markers. The nudity and foliage might allude to themes of nature, fertility, or a classical subject. Without further context or identifying attributes, a definitive religious or biblical interpretation cannot be made.",
