    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian. A haloed figure, presumably Saint Sebastian, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, his head tilted back and bleeding from wounds. He is dressed in a blue robe with gold trim. Two assailants, one in an orange tunic and the other in a green tunic and hat, stand over him. Both are depicted in the act of striking the saint with clubs or similar objects. The background is a richly patterned tapestry or textile, with a green, grassy ground beneath the figures.",
