    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, including a king, a bishop, and several other holy men, are depicted in a procession. The king wears a crown and a blue robe adorned with gold patterns, holding a cross-topped staff. The bishop is in full regalia, including a mitre and a richly decorated cope, also holding a staff. To the left, a figure in a vibrant orange robe and hat stands prominently. Behind them, other figures with halos suggest sainthood or religious significance. A small deer is visible on the right. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements and illuminated by golden rays emanating from a divine source above, set against a blue sky.",
