    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a woman, with a somber expression, looking towards the left. Behind her, a dark, stylized tree or foliage is visible. In the background, a silhouette of a fortified hill with a tower or castle-like structure is present. The overall atmosphere is dark and somewhat dramatic, suggesting a narrative moment. Given the context of Books of Hours, this could represent a scene from the Passion of Christ, such as the Agony in the Garden, or a devotional image of a sorrowful saint or the Virgin Mary.",
