    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a robed figure, likely a saint, wearing a red hat and a black habit, seated in a chair. The figure is tending to a lion, which is shown with its paw raised towards the figure's hand. To the left, a lectern holds an open book, and several other books are stacked nearby. The background features a brick wall and a patterned textile. The overall setting suggests an interior space, possibly a study or cell, within a religious context. This iconography is characteristic of Saint Jerome, often depicted with a lion, symbolizing his taming of wild beasts and his scholarly pursuits.",
