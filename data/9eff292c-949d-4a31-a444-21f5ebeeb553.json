    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an angelic figure with wings and a halo, inscribed with the text \"GLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO ET\", gesturing towards a pastoral landscape. Below the angel, three shepherds are shown tending to a flock of sheep. One shepherd, seated, looks upwards, while another stands and points, and a third, also standing, appears to be conversing. In the background, a town with a prominent tower and other buildings is visible. The entire scene is framed by an ornate, arched architectural border, suggesting a manuscript illumination.",
