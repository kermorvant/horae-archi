The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, looking down at the Christ Child lying on a white cloth. A donkey is visible behind her. An elderly man, possibly Joseph, kneels and holds a lit candle, illuminating the scene. In the background, a walled city with towers is visible amidst rolling hills and trees. Golden rays emanate from above, suggesting divine light.",
