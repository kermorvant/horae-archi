    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude child with reddish-blond hair stands in shallow blue water, pouring water from a golden pitcher. The child's posture suggests movement, with one leg forward and the other bent. The background depicts a landscape with green, undulating hills and a vast expanse of blue water under a bright blue sky. The scene is likely an allegorical representation of the zodiac sign Aquarius, depicted as a child pouring water, symbolizing the month of February or the astrological period.",
