    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, holding the Christ Child, is presented by a bearded man, likely Joseph, to a high priest. The high priest, wearing a white robe and a blue mantle, stands before a cylindrical altar. Behind them, a woman in a blue dress and green sash holds a basket and a staff, possibly representing a supplicant or a witness. The background features a red tapestry with gold ornamentation and an architectural element with arched windows, suggesting an interior setting within a religious building. The floor is tiled in green squares.",
