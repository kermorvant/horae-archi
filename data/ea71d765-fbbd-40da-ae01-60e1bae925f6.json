    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the arrest of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus, with a golden halo, is being embraced by Judas, who points to him. A group of soldiers, armed with swords and spears, surround them. One soldier in the foreground is falling, while another, dressed in blue and gold, stands guard. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible, set against a landscape with rolling hills and trees. The overall composition suggests a dramatic moment of betrayal and capture.",
