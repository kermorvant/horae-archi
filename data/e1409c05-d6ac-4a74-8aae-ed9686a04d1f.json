    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ emerging from a sarcophagus, which is open and partially filled with water. He is shown from the waist up, with wounds visible on his body, and a halo around his head. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or acknowledgment, while his left hand rests on his abdomen. A blue garment, possibly his tunic, is draped over the edge of the sarcophagus. Behind Christ, the background is a deep red, adorned with various instruments of the Passion, including nails, a hammer, pincers, and a sword. To the left, a ladder leans against a golden structure, and a column with a capital is visible. To the right, a dark, angled element suggests the lid of the sarcophagus. The overall scene represents the Resurrection of Christ.",
