    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with red wings and an orange robe, kneels on a green grassy ground, holding a scroll with text. He gestures towards the Virgin Mary on the right. The Virgin Mary, dressed in an orange undergarment and a blue and purple robe, stands with her hands clasped over her chest, looking slightly downwards. Behind them, a decorative gold and blue patterned background suggests a divine or celestial setting. Above and to the left, a bust of a bearded man, likely God the Father, is depicted within a blue cloud.",
