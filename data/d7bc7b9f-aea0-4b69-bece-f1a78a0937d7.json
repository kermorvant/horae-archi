    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identifiable by his halo and the eagle symbol perched on a rock behind him, writing on a scroll. He is dressed in a green tunic and a purple mantle. Two figures, a man in a red robe and a woman in a red dress and white headdress, stand on either side of him, with their hands clasped in prayer. The background is a seascape with a blue sky. This imagery likely represents Saint John the Evangelist in his role as an author of scripture, possibly the Book of Revelation, with patrons or devotees seeking his intercession or inspiration.",
