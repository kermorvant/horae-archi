He is surrounded by angels, some of whom are blowing trumpets and holding the instruments of the Passion, such as a cross. Below Christ, a group of figures, including men and women, are shown kneeling and praying. Some of these figures appear to be emerging from the ground, suggesting a resurrection or a gathering of souls. The setting is a vibrant blue sky with green ground below, indicating a celestial or earthly realm.",
