    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with Saint Elizabeth, clad in a golden, patterned robe, kneeling and embracing Saint Mary, who wears a blue mantle. Between them stands an older man, likely Saint Joseph, with a grey beard and hair, his hands clasped. In the background, a building with arched windows and a tiled roof is visible, suggesting a domestic or religious setting. A figure in blue kneels in prayer within an opening of the building, and another figure is partially visible in a doorway. The landscape is rendered with rolling green hills and a pale blue sky with stylized clouds.",
