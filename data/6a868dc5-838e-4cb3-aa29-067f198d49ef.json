    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation over the dead body of Christ. Christ's body, pale and marked with wounds, lies on a white shroud atop a stone sarcophagus. He is attended by several figures: the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, cradles his head with a sorrowful expression; John the Evangelist, in red, looks on with hands clasped in prayer; another figure, possibly Nicodemus, stands to the left holding a vessel, perhaps for anointing; and an older man, likely Joseph of Arimathea, stands to the right, his hand resting on Christ's body. The background is a simple landscape with rolling green hills under a pale blue sky. The sarcophagus itself is decorated with carved arches.",
