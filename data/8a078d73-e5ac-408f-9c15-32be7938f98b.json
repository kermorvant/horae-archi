    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed male figures, identified as Saints Peter and Paul, are depicted seated on wooden benches within a grand architectural space. Saint Peter, on the left, wears a blue and green robe over a red garment and holds an open book with a key symbol. Saint Paul, on the right, is dressed in a golden tunic and a blue robe, and holds a sword upright. Behind them, the scene reveals the interior of a Gothic-style building with tall, arched windows and columns. The overall setting suggests a church or a similar religious edifice, possibly depicting a moment of theological discussion or contemplation between the two apostles.",
