    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a female saint, identified by her halo and the arrow piercing her body, holding an open book. She stands within an arched doorway, with a dark, ornate door to her left. Through the doorway, a landscape is visible where a male figure aims a bow and arrow at a female figure. The saint is dressed in a blue gown and a golden cloak, with a pink skirt. The background is a textured green and blue, suggesting an outdoor setting beyond the immediate architectural frame. The overall composition suggests a narrative moment, possibly illustrating the martyrdom of the saint.",
