    "scene_description_enriched": "An elderly man with a red cap and a long grey beard, dressed in a blue robe and a red mantle, is seated in a richly decorated chair, writing in an open book placed on a lectern. Beside him, a lion sits attentively. The scene is set indoors, with a window showing a diamond-patterned glass in the background. Shelves filled with books are visible behind the man, suggesting a study or library. The overall impression is one of scholarly activity and contemplation.",
