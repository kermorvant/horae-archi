Below, the Virgin lies on a richly decorated bed, attended by grieving Apostles. Above them, in a celestial realm, the Virgin Mary and God the Father are enthroned, holding hands, signifying their union in heaven. The entire composition is framed by an arched border adorned with floral motifs and gold leaf, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
