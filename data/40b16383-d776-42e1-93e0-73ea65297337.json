    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue and resting on a pillow, gazes upwards. Beside her, Joseph, wearing a hat and an orange robe, leans forward, resting his head on his hand and holding a staff. In the background, within an arched structure with a gold leaf background, the Christ Child lies in a manger between a donkey and a goat. A blue chalice-like object hangs above the manger, possibly representing a lamp or a symbolic element. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with bold outlines and flat colors. The setting appears to be a stable, suggested by the presence of the animals and the manger.",
