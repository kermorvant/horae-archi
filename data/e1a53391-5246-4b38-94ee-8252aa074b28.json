    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, wavy hair and elaborate headwear stands holding a large rose on a stem. She is dressed in a long, ornate gown with decorative stitching and a belt adorned with circular motifs. Her left hand is positioned near the rose, and her right hand holds the stem. The background is plain, with some indication of foliage or ground at the bottom.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The rose is a common symbol for the Virgin Mary, often referred to as the \"Mystical Rose\" in devotional contexts. The woman depicted is likely the Virgin Mary, presented in a symbolic rather than narrative scene.",
