    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a male figure, likely a saint, shown from the chest up against a blue sky with wispy clouds. He has a tonsure and a wound on his head, from which blood is flowing. He wears a white garment underneath a purple cloak adorned with gold patterns. In his right hand, he holds a stone, and in his left, he holds a palm frond, both symbols of martyrdom. The figure's gaze is directed to the right, and his expression is somewhat pained. The setting is outdoors, with a hint of green landscape at the bottom.",
