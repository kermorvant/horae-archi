    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed woman, likely a saint, stands with her head tilted slightly and eyes downcast. She wears a white veil, a blue tunic with gold detailing, and a red mantle. Her right hand holds a white cloth, while her left hand grasps a decorative vessel. In the background, a stylized landscape with green rounded trees and small buildings with orange roofs is visible, beyond which lies a city with blue walls and towers under a bright blue sky. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
