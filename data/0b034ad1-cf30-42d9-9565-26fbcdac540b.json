    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and blue and gold robe, standing and raising a whip-like object, seemingly in the act of expelling figures from a space. He is facing a table covered with a blue cloth, on which are placed several round objects that appear to be coins or weights. To Christ's right, three individuals are depicted. One man, wearing a red tunic and a blue and gold turban, looks towards Christ with a hand on his chest, appearing distressed or surprised. Behind him, another man in a blue robe and a red hat also looks on. A woman in a green dress and an elaborate headdress stands further back, observing the scene. The background suggests an interior architectural setting with columns, arched windows with diamond-shaped panes, and a tiled floor. The overall impression is one of divine intervention and judgment.",
