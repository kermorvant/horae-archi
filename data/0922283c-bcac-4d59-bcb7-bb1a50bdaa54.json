    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pentecost, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer at the center, clad in a blue robe. To her right, a figure in a pink robe also prays, with an open book before them. Surrounding them are several other figures, all with golden halos, looking upwards. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a celestial realm depicted with a starry blue sky and radiating golden light. The figures are situated within an architectural space characterized by wooden beams and a large, arched window with tracery, suggesting an upper room or a chapel.",
