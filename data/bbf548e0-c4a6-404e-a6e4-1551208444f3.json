    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, framed by an arched border adorned with floral motifs. Christ is shown on the cross, bleeding from his wounds, with a crown of thorns on his head. Below the cross, the Virgin Mary stands to the left, her hands clasped in prayer and her head bowed in sorrow. To the right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, gazes upwards at Christ with his hand raised in a gesture of lament or supplication, holding a book. The setting is an outdoor landscape with stylized trees and hills under a starry blue sky, suggesting a celestial or symbolic representation of the event.",
