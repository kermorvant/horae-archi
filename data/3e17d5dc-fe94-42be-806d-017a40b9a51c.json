    "scene_description_enriched": "A lone male figure, depicted as a pilgrim, stands in a verdant landscape under a blue sky. He wears a wide-brimmed hat, a red outer garment over a blue tunic, and carries a staff in his right hand and a satchel over his left shoulder. The background features rolling hills, lush foliage, and a distant, stylized blue building with a spire. The figure's attire and accoutrements suggest a journey, possibly a pilgrimage, a common theme in devotional art.",
