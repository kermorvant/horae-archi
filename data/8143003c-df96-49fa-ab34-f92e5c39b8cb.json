    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a single figure, a bearded man wearing a cap and a robe, holding a book. He is framed by decorative architectural elements, including what appears to be a pointed arch above him and ornamental tracery. The lower portion of the image shows a frieze-like band with repeating arched motifs. The overall style suggests a woodcut illustration, likely from a printed book.",
