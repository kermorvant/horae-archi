    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic shelter, possibly a stable, indicated by the presence of a cow and an ox. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, kneels in adoration before the Christ Child, who is seated in a manger and radiating light. Saint Joseph, in a red robe, is also present, leaning forward with his hands clasped in prayer. Above, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted within a red halo, sending rays of light down towards the scene. An angel with wings is also visible, attending to the scene. The background is a richly decorated tapestry-like pattern of gold squares interspersed with blue and red circular motifs. The shelter itself is constructed of wooden beams and thatched roofing.",
