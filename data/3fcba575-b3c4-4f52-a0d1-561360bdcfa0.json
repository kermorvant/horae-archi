    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures within an arched frame, suggesting an interior setting. On the left, a man in dark robes is seated on a throne-like structure, looking towards the center. In the middle, a figure, possibly a woman, stands and holds a vessel with a lid, offering it to the seated man. To the right, a haloed man in a long robe stands, facing the seated figure. Behind him, another figure is partially visible. The background features vertical bars, reminiscent of a window or screen, and a patterned wall. The overall composition is framed by decorative foliage.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of offering or presentation, possibly related to a saint or a biblical event involving a ritualistic act. The halo on the standing figure suggests sanctity, and the act of offering a vessel could allude to a sacrament, a gift, or a symbolic offering.",
