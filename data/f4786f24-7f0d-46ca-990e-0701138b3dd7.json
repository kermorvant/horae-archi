    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an architectural setting. In the foreground, a bishop, clad in a blue chasuble and white alb, holds a chalice and appears to be officiating. Two acolytes in golden robes kneel beside him, one holding a processional cross or standard with a red flame-like element, and the other assisting with a book. Behind them, a tomb-like structure contains the figure of Christ, depicted with wounds from the Passion, rising from the tomb. In the background, a group of onlookers, some with hands clasped in prayer, observe the event. The architecture suggests an interior space with columns and arches, possibly a church or chapel.",
