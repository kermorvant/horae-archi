    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ's body, pale and lifeless, is being lowered from the cross by two figures. One figure, wearing a red cap and robe, supports Christ's head and upper body, while another, in a red robe, assists from a ladder. Christ's halo is visible. Below, a group of mourners, including the Virgin Mary in blue, dressed in mourning attire, and other women, express their grief. On the right, a group of men, some with beards and wearing turbans or caps, observe the scene. In the upper part of the frame, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted with a golden halo and rays, overseeing the event. The setting is a grassy landscape with hills in the background, under a blue sky with golden rays emanating from a sun-like symbol. The entire scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
