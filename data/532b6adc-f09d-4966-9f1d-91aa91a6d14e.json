    "scene_description_enriched": "An elderly man with a white beard and a blue turban, wearing a red tunic and a purple cloak, is depicted writing in a large illuminated book placed on a desk. He holds a quill in his right hand. To his right stands a younger figure, possibly an angel, with curly blond hair and a halo, holding another open book. The background suggests an interior space with dark walls and two windows showing a blue sky. The scene is likely an illustration of a prophet or evangelist at work, inspired by divine revelation.",
