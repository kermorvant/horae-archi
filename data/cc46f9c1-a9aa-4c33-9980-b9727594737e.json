    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed women embracing. The woman on the left, dressed in flowing robes, gently supports the woman on the right, who is kneeling and appears to be in distress, with her head bowed and her face partially obscured by a veil or head covering. Behind them, to the right, is a stylized architectural structure resembling a small building or tower with arched openings and a pitched roof, situated on a rocky outcrop. The background is filled with a decorative pattern of intersecting lines and trident-like motifs.",
