Bloodstains are visible on his legs and torso, indicating the suffering of the crucifixion. He is affixed to a rough wooden cross, which stands against a vibrant red background adorned with a repeating pattern of stylized golden foliage. The ground beneath the cross is depicted as dark and uneven. The overall impression is one of intense suffering and religious devotion.",
