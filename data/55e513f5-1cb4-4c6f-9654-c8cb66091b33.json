    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two parts by decorative architectural elements. On the left, a haloed figure, likely the Virgin Mary, is seated beneath a tree. An angel, with outstretched wings and arm, appears to be descending towards her, possibly in a gesture of communication or blessing. A diamond-shaped motif is positioned between them. On the right, another winged figure, also an angel, stands holding an open book. The background is a starry sky, suggesting a celestial or divine setting. The overall composition evokes a sense of divine revelation or visitation.",
