    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a fantastical composition with a human-like figure, possibly a satyr or a wild man, interacting with mythical creatures. The figure, with a headdress and a shield, appears to be wrestling or taming a lion-like beast with a bird's head. Above them, a ferret-like animal climbs amongst stylized foliage and flowers. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a decorative border or a stylized natural setting. The overall impression is one of a medieval bestiary or a scene from classical mythology, rendered in a woodcut style.",
