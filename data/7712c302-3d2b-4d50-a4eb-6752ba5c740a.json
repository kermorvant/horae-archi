    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body pale and wounded. To the left, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle over a red dress, stands with her hands clasped to her chest, her head bowed in sorrow. To the right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also in red and blue, stands with his hands clasped, looking towards the cross. The background is a stylized landscape of brown hills and green foliage, with a golden sky. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
