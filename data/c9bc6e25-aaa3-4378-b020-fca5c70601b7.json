    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a calendar page on the left, featuring decorative initials and text. Below the calendar, a man in red trousers and a blue tunic, wearing a red cap, herds cattle and wild boars. He holds a stick, seemingly guiding the animals. In the background, a town with towers and walls is visible on a hill. To the right, a building with an arched opening reveals a butcher's stall with a hanging carcass, suggesting the month of November and its associated activities. The sky above is a pale blue with a stylized sun.",
