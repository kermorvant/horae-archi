    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ. Christ, with a crown of thorns, lies on a wooden cross, his body emaciated and marked with wounds. Two figures are actively nailing his hands to the cross, one holding Christ's arm while the other hammers. A third figure, in a yellow tunic, kneels and appears to be preparing to hammer the other hand. A crowd of onlookers stands in the background, some appearing to be soldiers and others civilians. In the middle ground, a group of figures, possibly Roman soldiers and religious authorities, observe the scene. One figure in a brown robe and a distinctive yellow hat stands prominently. In the far distance, a city with spires and towers is visible, set against a backdrop of rolling hills and rocky outcrops under a cloudy sky. The overall setting is an open, grassy field.",
