    "scene_description_enriched": "A grey, shaggy goat with long, wavy hair and large, curved horns is depicted sitting on a green grassy mound. The goat's legs are visible, and its head is turned upwards. Above the goat, a decorative vine with small, stylized leaves and insect-like figures sprouts from the margin. The overall scene is rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner typical of medieval manuscripts.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a zodiacal sign or a bestiary illustration. Given the goat's appearance, it could be associated with Capricorn, the tenth astrological sign, often depicted as a sea-goat or a terrestrial goat. In medieval bestiaries, animals were often imbued with symbolic meanings, and a goat could represent various virtues or vices depending on the context.",
