    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross in the center. He is depicted with a crown of thorns and a loincloth, and blood is visible from his wounds. To the left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, with her hands clasped in sorrow. To the right, a figure in red and blue robes, likely Saint John the Evangelist, holds an open book. In the background, a fortified castle with towers and walls is visible, set against a landscape of rolling hills and scattered trees. The sky above is a pale blue with some stylized clouds and stars.",
