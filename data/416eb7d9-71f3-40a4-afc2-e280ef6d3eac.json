    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures stand within an architectural setting, framed by pointed arches. The figure on the left, with a halo, wears a reddish-brown cloak over a blue tunic and holds an orange book. The figure on the right, also with a halo, wears a blue cloak adorned with gold dots over an orange tunic, a hat, and carries a scroll and a staff. Both figures have bare feet and stand on a green ground. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or sacred context. The architectural elements suggest a Gothic style, with pointed arches and decorative columns.",
