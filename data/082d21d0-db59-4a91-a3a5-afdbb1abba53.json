    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable, characterized by a thatched roof supported by wooden beams and a stone wall. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies swaddled in a manger of straw. To the left, a figure in a blue tunic and red hat plays a bagpipe, while another in a green tunic dances. A third figure, kneeling in a red robe, gestures towards the infant. To the right, the Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue robe and halo, reads from a book. A donkey stands nearby. Through an open archway, a picturesque landscape unfolds, featuring a winding road, trees, and a walled city with towers and a castle on a hill. The overall scene, with its juxtaposition of the sacred event and earthly revelry, suggests the joyous celebration of Christ's birth.",
