    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in an interior setting, likely a workshop or a display area. On the left, a person dressed in dark robes points with a slender stick towards a collection of jewelry and beads displayed on a light blue background. The jewelry includes necklaces, pendants, and what appear to be reliquaries or small decorative boxes, rendered in gold and with colored accents. To the right, two women, one slightly in front of the other, are also observing the display. The woman in the foreground wears a pink gown with a black bodice and white cuffs, and she also holds a pointer, indicating her engagement with the displayed items. The background architecture is suggested by horizontal and vertical lines, possibly representing shelves or display cases, and a hint of a vaulted ceiling or structure above. The overall impression is one of a merchant or artisan presenting their wares.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is likely a representation of a merchant or artisan displaying precious objects, possibly for sale or as part of a devotional context where such items might be commissioned or owned. Without specific religious iconography, it's difficult to assign a precise biblical or liturgical event. However, the display of valuable items could relate to themes of wealth, patronage, or the presentation of sacred objects.",
