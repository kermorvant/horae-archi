    "scene_description_enriched": "An elderly, bearded man wearing a blue cap and a pink cloak over a dark garment kneels in a grassy field dotted with yellow flowers. He holds an open blue book in his left hand and a rosary of red beads hangs around his neck. In his right hand, he grips a wooden staff. Behind him, a golden pig with a bell around its neck looks upwards. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with gold and blue lettering, and rays of gold emanate from behind the man's head, suggesting divine illumination. The background features stylized green hills. The overall impression is one of a devout hermit or saint in contemplation.",
