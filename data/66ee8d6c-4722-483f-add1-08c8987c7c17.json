    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and holding the Christ Child, is attended by Saint Joseph. Three Magi, one kneeling and offering a gift, approach them. Behind them, a procession of figures, some on horseback, and a cityscape with buildings and towers are visible. The entire scene is framed by ornate Gothic architectural elements, including pointed arches and decorative tracery, suggesting a devotional context within a stylized architectural setting.",
