    "scene_description_enriched": "A person, likely David, is depicted kneeling and looking upwards with hands clasped in prayer. To the left, a bird, possibly an eagle or a dove, is shown with its beak open, facing the praying figure. The scene is set outdoors, amidst foliage that suggests a natural environment. The posture of the figure and the presence of the bird are suggestive of a devotional scene, possibly representing David in prayer or a moment of divine inspiration.",
