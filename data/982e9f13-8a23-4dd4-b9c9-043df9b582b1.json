    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, stands in a landscape. The figure wears a red tunic with gold trim and a blue mantle. They hold a palm frond, a symbol of martyrdom, in their right hand and have their hands clasped in prayer or supplication. The background depicts a stylized cityscape with towers and spires, suggesting a distant urban setting. Rocky formations frame the scene on the left and right, and the ground is a green field. The overall impression is one of a devotional image, possibly depicting a saint in contemplation or awaiting divine intervention.",
