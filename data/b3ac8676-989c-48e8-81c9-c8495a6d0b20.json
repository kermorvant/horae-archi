    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a tormented man, seated and looking upwards with a pained expression, his arms crossed. He is partially covered by a cloth. Behind him, a demonic figure with horns and a menacing grin holds a club or staff, seemingly poised to strike. To the right, two human figures, one appearing to be a woman in a headdress and the other a man behind her, observe the scene. The background is abstract, with hatching suggesting a rough or mountainous terrain, and framed by decorative architectural elements at the top. This scene is likely an allegorical representation of temptation or suffering, possibly depicting a soul being tormented by demons, or a saint enduring trials.",
