    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures, identified as Christ and Saint John the Baptist, standing in a verdant landscape. Christ, on the left, wears a golden robe and a blue mantle, with a halo indicating his divinity. He gestures with his right hand towards Saint John the Baptist, who stands on the right, clad in a red tunic and a golden mantle, also with a halo. The background features rolling green hills, trees, and distant mountains under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The scene is framed by ornate columns decorated with sculpted figures, suggesting a decorative border rather than architectural context for the main figures.",
