    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bearded man, likely a monk or a religious figure, in profile. He wears a hooded robe and has his right hand raised to his ear, as if listening intently or in contemplation. His left hand holds a folded document or scroll. The figure is framed by architectural elements that suggest an interior space, possibly a niche or a decorative architectural surround. The overall style is that of a woodcut or wood engraving, common in early printed Books of Hours.",

The gesture of listening with the hand to the ear is often associated with prophets or individuals receiving divine revelation. The document in his hand could symbolize scripture, a divine decree, or a prayer.",
