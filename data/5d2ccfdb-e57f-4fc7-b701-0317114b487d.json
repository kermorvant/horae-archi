    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, some with beards and wearing hats, stand on the left, looking towards a monstrous, multi-headed beast on the right. One figure in the center, wearing a conical hat and elaborate robes, gestures towards the beast with an open hand, while another figure beside them clasps their hands in prayer. The beast appears to be emerging from a rocky or mountainous terrain. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a confrontation with a monstrous entity, possibly representing evil or a trial. Given the context of Books of Hours, this could be an illustration related to the Book of Revelation, specifically the beast from the sea or the dragon, or a hagiographic scene of a saint overcoming a demonic force.",
