    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in conversation, framed by an arched border with decorative elements. The woman on the left, dressed in a flowing blue robe, has long blonde hair and appears to be kneeling or in a humble posture. The woman on the right, wearing a golden-brown garment and a white headdress, is reaching out to her. Behind them, a rolling landscape unfolds with a distant town or village nestled in the hills. Dominating the background is a fortified castle with multiple towers and crenellated walls, perched on a hill. The overall impression is one of a significant encounter set against a backdrop of medieval architecture and landscape.",
