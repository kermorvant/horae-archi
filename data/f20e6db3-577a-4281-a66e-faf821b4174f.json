    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral landscape, a male shepherd, dressed in a pink tunic and blue sleeves, with a yellow hood and blue cap, leans on a staff and points towards a flock of sheep. Beside him, a woman in a blue dress with pink sleeves and a white headdress kneels, tending to a lamb. In the background, a river flows past a watermill, and several buildings with red roofs are nestled on rolling hills. The scene evokes a peaceful rural life, possibly alluding to the shepherds witnessing the Nativity or a general devotional theme of pastoral care and innocence.",
