    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Archangel Michael in full armor, with a red cape and green cloak, standing over a dragon-like creature. He holds a sword raised in his right hand, poised to strike, and a shield emblazoned with a red cross in his left. His wings are spread, and he is surrounded by golden rays and white clouds, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The dragon, depicted as a monstrous, grey beast with sharp teeth and claws, writhes beneath Michael's feet, representing evil being vanquished. The overall composition conveys a sense of triumph and divine power.",
