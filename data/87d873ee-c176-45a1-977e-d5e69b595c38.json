    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King David kneeling in prayer within an architectural setting, identifiable by a column and arched window. He is dressed in a royal blue robe adorned with gold embroidery and has a harp at his feet. To his right, an angelic figure with large wings and a flowing white garment stands in an outdoor landscape. The angel holds a scroll with text and is depicted with bare breasts. Above the angel, a banner with text is unfurled, and in the upper right corner, a haloed figure, possibly Christ or a saint, is shown pointing. The overall scene suggests a divine communication or revelation to David.",
