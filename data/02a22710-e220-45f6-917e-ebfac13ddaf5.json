    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity. God the Father, an elderly bearded figure wearing a crown and a red cloak, holds the body of Christ, who is depicted as dead and naked, wrapped in a white loincloth. Christ's wounds are visible, including a wound on his side. The Holy Spirit is represented as a dove, flying above and behind Christ's head. The figures are set against a golden, radiating background, suggesting a divine or heavenly realm. The scene is framed by dark, rocky, or cloud-like forms on either side, creating a sense of enclosure and emphasizing the celestial nature of the event.",
