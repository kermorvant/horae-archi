Two angels, also in white robes and with golden wings, kneel beside them. The angel on the left plays a harp, while the angel on the right holds a book or tablet and appears to be singing or speaking. The background features a red, gold-patterned tapestry behind the figures, and a blue sky with white clouds to the left. A low brick wall is visible behind the tapestry. The scene is framed by decorative gold elements at the top, resembling stylized shells or fans.",
