    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in a landscape setting. The woman on the left, dressed in a blue robe and holding an orange book, has a halo and appears to be the Virgin Mary. The woman on the right, wearing an orange cloak over a pinkish robe and a white veil, is embracing the first woman and touching her abdomen. The background features a patterned textile with diamond shapes in gold, blue, and red, set against stylized brown mountains and green grass with small plants. This imagery strongly suggests the Visitation, a biblical event where Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth.",
