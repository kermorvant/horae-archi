    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a grassy outdoor setting, with a decorative gold background suggesting a manuscript illumination. In the foreground, a barefoot man in a blue robe, identified by a halo, gestures towards a seated figure. To the left, another figure in an orange robe and hood approaches, also gesturing. Behind the central figure, a person in a green head covering holds a cross. The seated figure, dressed in an elaborate orange robe and a blue bishop's mitre, appears to be receiving or addressing the others. The overall composition, with its stylized figures and rich ornamentation, points to a religious narrative.",
