    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with red and white wings descends from a radiant sky, holding a golden banner inscribed with \"GLORIA IN EXCELSIS DEO.\" Below, a flock of sheep grazes in a pastoral landscape dotted with houses and a distant castle. Three shepherds are depicted: one seated, looking upwards in awe; another standing, holding a staff and gazing towards the angel; and a third seated, gesturing towards the angel with an expression of surprise. The scene is framed by stylized trees and a body of water in the foreground.",
