    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowd of people are depicted, with a central figure wearing a blue robe with gold trim and a red mantle. This figure has a white beard and is holding a staff or crozier. To his left, another figure in a blue robe holds a golden chalice. Several other individuals in the crowd wear religious headwear, including mitres, and are dressed in blue and green robes. The scene appears to be set outdoors, indicated by the clear blue sky above and the lack of interior architectural features. The presence of religious figures and the chalice suggests a religious ceremony or procession.",
