    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a simple architectural setting. The Virgin Mary, seated and holding the Christ Child, is attended by a figure in a hooded robe. Three Magi are present: one kneels before Mary, offering a gift, while another stands holding a chalice, and a third stands behind him holding a scepter. A beam of light descends from the upper left, illuminating the scene. The architecture consists of rough stone walls and an arched opening, suggesting a humble dwelling or stable. The figures are rendered with gold highlights on their garments and crowns, indicating their importance.",
