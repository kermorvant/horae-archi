She wears a fur-lined mantle and a rosary with a pendant. On the right, a woman richly dressed in an orange gown with red sleeves and a black headdress sits on a raised dais. She holds a decorative blue and white lidded vessel. Behind her is a green tiled wall and a wooden canopy. To the left, an arched opening reveals an outdoor landscape with rolling green hills, a blue sky, and some rudimentary buildings. A peacock stands on the floor in the foreground.",
