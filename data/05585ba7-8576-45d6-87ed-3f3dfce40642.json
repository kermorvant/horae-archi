    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a male figure, likely a saint, with his arms bound behind his back. He is pierced by two arrows, one entering his chest and the other his side, with blood visible at the wounds. He wears a yellow loincloth and has a halo around his head, topped with a red crown or wreath. The background is a deep blue curtain, suggesting a symbolic or devotional setting rather than a literal one. A decorative initial 'E' in gold on a red square is visible in the upper right corner.",
