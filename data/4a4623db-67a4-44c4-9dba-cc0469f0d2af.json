In the center, two angels stand together, one holding open a large book of musical notation, while the other places a hand on the book, suggesting they are singing or reading together. Behind them, a man wearing a blue cap and tunic looks on from a balcony. The architectural setting includes a balcony with arched openings and a wall behind it, suggesting an elevated or interior space.",
