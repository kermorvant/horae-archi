    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman in a flowing red gown stands in a verdant landscape, holding a balance scale. Her long blonde hair is loose, and she gazes downwards. The background depicts rolling hills dotted with trees and bushes under a pale blue sky. The scene is rendered in a stylized, somewhat flat manner typical of medieval manuscript illumination, with a focus on symbolic representation rather than naturalistic detail. The woman's posture and the presence of the balance scale suggest a personification of the zodiac sign Libra.",
