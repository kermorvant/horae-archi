    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man, identified as Saint Mark by his halo and the presence of his symbol, the winged lion, seated and writing on a scroll. He is dressed in dark robes and appears to be in deep concentration. The winged lion, also with a halo, sits beside him, looking towards the scroll. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that includes an arched recess behind them, decorated with a starry pattern. To the left, a patterned wall or tapestry is visible, and to the right, a column supports the arch. The overall composition is framed by decorative borders, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
