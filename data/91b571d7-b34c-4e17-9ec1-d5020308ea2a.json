    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude figure, possibly representing a woman, is depicted seated and pouring water from a jug into a basin or trough. The figure has long, wavy hair and is shown from the waist up, with their legs extending downwards. Behind the figure, there is a dense foliage of grapes and leaves, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall style is illustrative and somewhat stylized, typical of woodcut prints.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely represents a personification of a month or a zodiac sign, possibly Aquarius, given the act of pouring water. In medieval iconography, such allegorical figures were common in calendars and Books of Hours to mark the passage of time and seasons.",
