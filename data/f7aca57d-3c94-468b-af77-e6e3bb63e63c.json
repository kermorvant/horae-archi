    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed female figures, likely saints or holy women, in close proximity. The figure on the left wears a blue mantle over a purple garment, her hands clasped in prayer. Her eyes are downcast, conveying a sense of solemnity or grief. The figure on the right, with golden hair, is draped in a pinkish-red robe adorned with gold accents. Her head is tilted, and her eyes are also closed, suggesting a shared emotional state. The background is a vibrant blue with abstract, cloud-like forms, and a hint of architectural elements is suggested by faint lines in the upper right corner, though not clearly defined. The overall impression is one of quiet contemplation and shared devotion.",
