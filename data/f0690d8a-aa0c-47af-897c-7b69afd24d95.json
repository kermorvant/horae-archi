    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity. God the Father, depicted as an elderly man with a halo and a gesture of blessing, holds the cross upon which Christ is crucified. The Holy Spirit is represented by a dove descending towards Christ. Christ's body is rendered with wounds, and blood drips from his hands and feet. God the Father is seated on a throne-like structure, with his arms outstretched to support the cross. The background is a rich blue tapestry with a repeating geometric pattern. The entire scene is framed by an ornate border featuring geometric and foliate motifs in gold, red, and blue.",
