    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, dressed in a white robe with gold trim, holding a golden staff and gesturing towards the Virgin Mary on the right. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, holds an open book and raises her left hand in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. Above them, the Holy Spirit is represented by a white dove descending with outstretched wings, emanating rays of light. The background features a rich, patterned red tapestry, and the figures stand on a green, tiled floor. The scene is framed by an architectural arch and decorative foliage at the top.",
