    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, stands to the right of a wooden tub filled with water. Three nude children are immersed in the tub, their hands clasped in prayer. The bishop, dressed in a richly decorated blue cope and a red dalmatic, points towards the children. Above him, in a celestial realm depicted with a golden and blue patterned background, God the Father is shown with a halo and rays of light, his hand raised in blessing. The scene is framed by an architectural arch with decorative foliate motifs. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a rocky outcrop and vegetation on the right, and a green grassy area at the bottom.",
