    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle, cradles the Christ Child, who is swaddled in white. To their left, Saint Joseph, wearing a blue hat and a red and purple robe, leads a donkey. In the background, a green, grassy hill rises, topped by a small, golden architectural element. Above, a golden cherub or angel is depicted in flight. To the right, a simplified representation of buildings with arched windows suggests a distant town or city.",
