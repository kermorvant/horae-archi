    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint George, clad in armor and with white wings, standing over a defeated dragon. He holds a spear, poised to strike the creature. To his right stands a bishop, identified by his vestments and halo, holding a book and a sword. The background features a red, patterned tapestry and a checkered floor, suggesting an indoor setting. The overall composition is framed by an arched architectural element and decorative borders, typical of a manuscript illumination.",
