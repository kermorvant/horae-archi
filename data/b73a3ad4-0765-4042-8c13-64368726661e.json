    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely Saint Andrew, bound to an X-shaped cross by ropes. His arms are outstretched and tied to the upper beams, and his feet are also secured. He has a pale complexion, a beard, and a halo, indicating his saintly status. Two figures, dressed in medieval attire, are actively involved in securing or torturing him. The figure on the left, in an orange tunic and blue hose, pulls a rope attached to the saint's left arm. The figure on the right, in a blue patterned tunic and red hose, also pulls a rope. The background is a rich red tapestry with a repeating gold pattern, and the ground is depicted as a green field with stylized white and gold plants. The overall impression is one of martyrdom and suffering.",
