    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in what appears to be an outdoor setting, suggested by a green, undulating landscape and a pale blue sky. On the left, a woman in a blue mantle and white veil bows her head, her hands clasped in her lap. Her expression is somber. To her right, another figure, possibly a woman, touches her ear with her hand, her gaze directed downwards, also conveying a sense of distress or contemplation. A vertical, wooden beam or post is visible between the two figures, and a hint of architectural structure is suggested by a red border at the bottom, possibly indicating the edge of a building or a decorative element. The overall impression is one of shared sorrow or a moment of quiet reflection.",
