    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. On the left, two men in armor and wearing crowns are shown, one holding a staff or spear. To the right, a figure, possibly a woman, is leaning out of a window, being lowered or helped by someone. Below the window, a man kneels in prayer, looking upwards. The architecture features pointed arches and decorative elements suggestive of Gothic style, with a hint of a building structure on the far right.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the story of Saint Paul's escape from Damascus, where he was lowered in a basket from the city walls by his disciples to evade his persecutors. The kneeling figure could be a disciple or a representation of faith.",
