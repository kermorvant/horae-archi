    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a long beard and flowing hair, wearing a distinctive hat and a patterned tunic, is depicted in profile. He is seated, with his hands resting on his lap. To his left, architectural elements suggest an interior space, possibly a room or a niche, with decorative columns and an arched opening filled with a stippled pattern, perhaps representing foliage or a textured background. The overall style is illustrative and somewhat stylized, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image does not depict a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional scene that can be definitively identified. It appears to be a portrait of a figure, possibly a saint, a king, or a donor, within an architectural setting.",
