The Child reaches out towards one of the Magi, who is kneeling and offering a golden chalice. Behind them, two other Magi, distinguished by their crowns and rich attire, stand holding their own gifts. An ox and a donkey are visible in the background, and the starry blue sky is seen through the open roof structure. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
