    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, clad in a blue cope and a red mitre, kneels in prayer before an altar. Above the altar, Christ stands with arms outstretched, displaying the stigmata on his hands and feet. A chalice is placed on the altar, and a book lies open before it. The background is a red tapestry adorned with a gold grid pattern and circular motifs. The floor is tiled in a red and black diamond pattern. The scene likely depicts the bishop's devotion to Christ's sacrifice, possibly during Mass or a private devotional moment.",
