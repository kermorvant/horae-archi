    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, with a halo, stands bound and partially unclothed, his torso showing marks of previous torment. Two figures, presumably tormentors, are actively engaged in scourging him. One on the left wields a whip, while the figure on the right appears to be striking him with a mace-like object. The background is sparse, suggesting an outdoor or rudimentary setting, with a suggestion of a wooden structure above.",
