    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, cradles the Christ Child, who is also haloed. They are surrounded by several figures. To the left, a woman in a head covering holds a child. To the right, a figure in a hooded robe holds a small animal, possibly a lamb or a cat. Several men, some in elaborate attire and others in simpler robes, are gathered around, presenting gifts. One man kneels and offers a chalice. The background suggests a rustic stable with wooden beams and a thatched roof, with rays of light emanating from above, possibly symbolizing divine intervention. The overall setting is humble, emphasizing the significance of the event.",
