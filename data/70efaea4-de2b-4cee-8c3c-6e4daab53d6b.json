    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands on a green checkered floor, holding an open book. He is dressed in elaborate blue and pink vestments. Behind him, a richly patterned red tapestry adorns the wall. To the right, three nude figures are partially submerged in a wooden tub. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element with a blue, star-studded vaulted ceiling and tall, multi-paned windows. This depiction likely represents a saintly bishop performing a miracle, possibly related to healing or baptism, given the presence of the nude figures in the tub.",
