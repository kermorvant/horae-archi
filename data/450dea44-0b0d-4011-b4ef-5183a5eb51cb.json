    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with his body rendered in pale tones and bloodstains visible on the cross and ground. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a deep blue mantle, bows her head in sorrow. To the right, Saint John the Evangelist, in an orange cloak over a blue tunic, also looks down with grief. The figures are set against a richly patterned gold background composed of alternating blue and red squares, each containing a floral motif. The entire composition is framed by an arched border adorned with floral and foliate designs.",
