    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a blue mantle and an orange dress, tenderly embraces the Christ Child. She is shown with her eyes closed, her head tilted towards the child, suggesting a moment of deep maternal affection and devotion. The Christ Child, with a halo, is held securely in her arms. They are positioned on a crescent moon, symbolizing the Virgin's purity and her role as the \"Woman of the Apocalypse\" (Revelation 12:1). The background is a rich tapestry of gold squares interspersed with blue and orange, creating a divine and opulent setting. Decorative floral motifs adorn the arched frame of the illumination.",
