    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a female saint, likely Saint Catherine of Alexandria, standing within an arched architectural frame. She wears a golden crown and a halo, indicating her sanctity. Her long, golden hair flows down her shoulders. She is dressed in a rich robe with ermine trim, a blue undergarment, and a golden cloak. In her right hand, she holds a sword, and her left hand rests on a wheel, a common attribute of Saint Catherine, symbolizing her martyrdom. The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting an interior space or a symbolic representation. The overall presentation is within a decorative border, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
