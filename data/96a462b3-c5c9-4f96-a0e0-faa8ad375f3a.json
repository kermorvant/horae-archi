    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession of people moving uphill, carrying bundles. In the foreground, a woman in a golden robe kneels and works on a large, rough stone, possibly preparing it. To her left, a young man in a blue tunic holds a bundle of wool or similar material. Behind the kneeling woman, a man in a red tunic also carries a bundle. The procession itself is composed of many figures, predominantly women with white head coverings and men in various colored tunics, all carrying bundles and moving towards a dark, densely populated area in the background, which appears to be a hill covered with many small figures. The setting is an outdoor landscape with green fields and scattered trees under a cloudy sky.",
