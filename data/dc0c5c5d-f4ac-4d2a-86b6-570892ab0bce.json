    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint or prophet, stands in a landscape, holding an open red book and a staff. The figure wears a blue robe over a brown tunic, with bare feet visible. The background depicts a body of water with a boat, rolling hills, trees, and a large rock formation on the left. The scene is framed by an ornate initial 'S'. The figure's posture and the book suggest contemplation or preaching, common iconography for figures engaged in spiritual study or ministry.",
