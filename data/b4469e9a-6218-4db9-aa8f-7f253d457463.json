    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely Christ, in a purple robe adorned with gold, being led by guards. He wears a crown of thorns and his hands are bound. To the left, a man in a blue robe and a blue cap is seated on a wooden bench, pouring water from a jug into a basin held by another figure in an orange tunic and orange hose. This action, along with the presence of guards and the bound figure, suggests a scene of judgment or humiliation. The background features architectural elements, including an arched doorway and a column, indicating an indoor setting.",
