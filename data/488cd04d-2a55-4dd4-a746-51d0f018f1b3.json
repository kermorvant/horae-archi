To the right, a group of figures, some wearing elaborate hats, are gathered and looking towards a rocky outcrop. In the background, a castle with blue-tiled roofs and towers is visible. Birds fly in the sky above the castle. The overall setting appears to be a landscape with rolling hills and vegetation.",
