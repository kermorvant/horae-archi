    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely King David, kneels in prayer, his hands clasped. He wears a royal blue mantle adorned with a floral pattern over a red tunic and a turban-like crown. He is positioned within an architectural setting featuring columns and arches, with an open doorway revealing a glimpse of an interior space with a wooden chair and red fabric. To his right, a harp lies on the tiled floor. Through an opening, a landscape is visible with trees and rock formations, and in the upper right corner, a figure, possibly God or an angel, appears in the clouds, holding a golden orb and gesturing.",
