    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation of the Christ Child, held by a figure who appears to be Mary, to a group of men. The setting is an interior space with arched windows and columns. The floor is tiled with a green geometric pattern. A red banner with golden sunburst motifs hangs in the background. The figures are dressed in medieval attire, with halos indicating sanctity. One figure, possibly a priest or elder, wears a dark, conical hat and holds the child. Another figure, to the left, holds a key and a basket of flowers. The overall scene suggests a religious ceremony or event.",
