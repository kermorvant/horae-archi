    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue mantle with gold trim, stands with her hands clasped over her chest, gazing downwards with a serene expression. Beside her, Saint Joseph, wearing a red robe, leans forward with his hands pressed together in prayer or contemplation. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies swaddled in a white cloth on a pillow. Behind them, the head of a donkey is visible, and the structure of the stable, made of rough wooden beams, is apparent. The background opens to a landscape with hills under a bright blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting beyond the stable.",
