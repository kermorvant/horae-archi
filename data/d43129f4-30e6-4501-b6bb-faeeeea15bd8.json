On the right, the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue and with a halo, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before an ornate lectern with an open book. Behind her, a red drapery hangs. To the left, the Angel Gabriel, also with a halo and dressed in a pink robe, gestures with his right hand and holds a staff. Above the angel, the Holy Spirit is represented as a white dove descending in a golden light. The background is a blue sky with golden rays and scattered stars, suggesting a divine or celestial setting.",
