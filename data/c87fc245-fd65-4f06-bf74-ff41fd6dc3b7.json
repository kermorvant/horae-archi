    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial figure, identified by a halo and pointing gesture, interacting with a group of bearded men. The celestial figure, clad in a gold tunic and pink mantle, is positioned against a starry blue background. Below, a group of three men, one in a blue robe and two in red robes, are gathered. The man in the blue robe gestures upwards, seemingly in response to the celestial figure. Another man, kneeling and wearing a pink garment, operates a pair of bellows connected to a fiery furnace. The background features a decorative geometric pattern. This scene likely represents a divine intervention or revelation, possibly related to a miraculous event or a teaching moment, with the bellows and furnace suggesting a craft or a symbolic act of creation or purification.",
