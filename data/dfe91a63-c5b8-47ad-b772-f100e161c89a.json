    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a crowned woman with long hair wears a flowing gown. To her right, a man in armor, possibly a soldier or guard, holds a sword aloft. To the right of the armored man, a bearded man with long hair, possibly a religious figure, holds a round object in his hands. The background features architectural elements suggesting a building with arched openings and decorative pinnacles. The overall composition suggests a narrative scene, possibly related to a biblical or historical event.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple, with the crowned woman representing Mary, the bearded man representing Simeon, and the armored figure potentially a temple guard or a representation of Herod's soldiers. The round object held by Simeon could be the infant Christ, or a symbolic representation of him. The architectural setting is consistent with depictions of the Temple.",
