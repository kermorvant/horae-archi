He is depicted with a golden halo and rays of light emanating from above, suggesting divine presence. He wears a pink robe over a golden tunic and points with his right hand towards a swirling, cloud-like orb. A scroll unfurls from beneath his left arm, bearing Latin inscriptions: \"et terra\" (and earth) and \"fiat lux\" (let there be light). The background is a deep blue, adorned with golden stars, representing the cosmos.",
