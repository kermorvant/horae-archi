    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with wings spread and halo, kneels and points with a long staff towards the Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary, also with a halo, kneels on the right, her hands clasped in prayer over an open book. Above them, within an arched architectural frame adorned with floral motifs, a divine figure, likely God the Father, is depicted wearing a crown and holding a scepter, surrounded by smaller figures and radiating light. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is shown descending towards the Virgin Mary. The background suggests an interior space with patterned walls and a tiled floor.",
