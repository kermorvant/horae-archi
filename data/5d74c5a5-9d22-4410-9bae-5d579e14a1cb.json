    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in what appears to be an interior setting. On the left, a person in a blue garment and a white headdress is seated, with their hands engaged in an activity over a dark, oval object on a red surface. To the right, another figure, also in a blue garment and a white head covering, stands and looks upwards and to the left. This figure wears a white apron and holds a dark object in their hands. The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting an indoor domestic or service space. The scene likely represents a moment of daily life or a specific devotional narrative, possibly related to food preparation or service.",
