    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. Christ's body, pale and wounded, lies across the lap of the Virgin Mary, who is dressed in a blue mantle and appears sorrowful. Other figures, likely mourners, surround them. Behind them, a wooden cross is visible, suggesting the crucifixion. The scene is framed by an ornate, arched architectural element, possibly a canopy or part of a larger structure, with decorative details. The background shows a simplified architectural element, possibly a building with windows, and a blue sky.",
