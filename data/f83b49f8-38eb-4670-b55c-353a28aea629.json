He wears an ornate headdress and a richly decorated garment with circular motifs on the collar. His right hand is raised, with the index finger pointing upwards, suggesting a gesture of speech, prayer, or emphasis. The figure is framed by architectural elements, including what appears to be a decorative arch above and a column to the right, suggesting an interior or a structured setting. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, possibly representing foliage or a decorative textile.",
