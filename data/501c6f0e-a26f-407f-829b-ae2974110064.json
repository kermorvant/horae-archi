    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a bishop, is depicted seated within a dark, oval frame. The figure wears a white mitre adorned with gold, a blue cope trimmed with gold, and white gloves. They hold a crozier, a staff topped with a decorative finial, in their right hand and raise their left hand in a gesture of blessing. The figure is seated on a throne-like structure, with a gold halo surrounding their head, indicating sanctity. The background is a dark, unadorned space, suggesting a spiritual or elevated setting. The overall impression is one of religious authority and reverence.",
