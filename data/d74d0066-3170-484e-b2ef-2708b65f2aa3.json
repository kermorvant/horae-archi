    "scene_description_enriched": "A man wearing a blue robe and a red cap is depicted leaning over a wooden lectern, engrossed in reading a book. His left hand rests on his forehead, suggesting contemplation or perhaps fatigue, while his right hand points to the text. The lectern itself is a simple, sturdy structure with an arched opening at its base. The scene is set against a decorative background featuring stylized foliage and small, insect-like motifs, typical of manuscript illumination. The overall impression is one of scholarly pursuit or deep thought.",
