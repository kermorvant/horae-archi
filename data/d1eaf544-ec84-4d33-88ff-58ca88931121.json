    "scene_description_enriched": "A heraldic beast, resembling a marten or ferret, stands on a grassy ground. It is adorned with two shields. The larger shield, held over its back, is gold with a red cross, and is decorated with blue birds and grey scallop shells. A smaller, red shield bearing three gold fleurs-de-lis is held in its right paw. The background is a rich, patterned textile in shades of pink and gold, featuring floral motifs. The overall impression is one of heraldic display and symbolic representation, likely within a devotional context.",
