    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, all with halos, are depicted in a close-up composition. The central figure wears a short tunic and appears to be holding something in their left hand. Other figures are visible behind and around them, some with beards and wearing cloaks. The overall impression is of a gathering of saints or holy figures. The scene is rendered in a somewhat stylized manner, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
