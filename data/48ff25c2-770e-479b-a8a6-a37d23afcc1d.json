The kings are offering gifts, represented by ornate chalices. One king, with a dark complexion and a white cap, stands to the left. Another king, with a long beard and a blue crown, holds a chalice and points upwards. The third king, on the far right with a blue hood, also appears to be presenting a gift. The Christ Child is naked and reaches out towards the viewer. The background is a stylized landscape with rocky formations and hints of buildings in the distance, suggesting an outdoor setting.",
