    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a garden-like setting, possibly engaged in tending to plants. The figure on the left, wearing a hat and cloak, is bent over, holding a tool that resembles a sickle or scythe. To their right, another figure, also wearing a cap, appears to be interacting with foliage. Between the figures and a ram on the right, there is a decorative architectural element, possibly a balustrade or a section of a garden wall with pillars. The ram stands to the right, looking towards the figures. The background suggests a natural environment with trees and foliage, interspersed with architectural elements that hint at a structured outdoor space. The overall impression is one of pastoral activity within a cultivated area.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a pastoral or allegorical theme, possibly related to the months of the year or agricultural labor, common in Books of Hours. The presence of a ram could also allude to Christ as the Lamb of God or to the zodiac sign Aries, often associated with spring and renewal. Without further context, a specific biblical event is not clearly identifiable, but the imagery evokes themes of nature, cultivation, and perhaps divine providence over earthly matters.",
