    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two young women seated outdoors near a decorative fountain. The woman on the left wears a yellow robe and a blue cap, and is looking down at a book in her lap. The woman on the right wears a blue dress and a white veil, and appears to be looking towards the fountain. In the background, a walled city with towers and a large arched building is visible, with a figure in royal attire leaning out of a window. The overall setting suggests a peaceful, perhaps contemplative, moment in a garden or courtyard.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of leisure or study, possibly within a devotional context, given the presence of a book and the contemplative postures of the figures. The background architecture and the figure in the window might allude to a narrative or allegorical meaning, but without further context, a specific biblical or devotional event cannot be definitively identified. It could represent a scene from a romance, a contemplation of worldly affairs versus spiritual study, or a general depiction of virtuous women.",
