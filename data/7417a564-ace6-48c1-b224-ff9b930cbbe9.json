    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and cloaked in dark fabric, cradles the Christ Child on her lap. Three kings, identified by their crowns and rich attire, approach to offer gifts. The first king, standing, holds a crown. The second king, kneeling, presents a chalice. The third king, also standing, holds a vessel. Behind them, a rudimentary architectural structure with a thatched roof and visible beams suggests a stable or humble dwelling. The background shows a stylized landscape with trees and buildings. The overall composition is framed by decorative borders.",
