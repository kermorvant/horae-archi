    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble shelter. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and with a golden halo, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Behind her stands Saint Joseph, wearing a red hat and a brown garment over a striped tunic. In the foreground, the Christ Child, also with a halo, lies on a red manger or bed. To the right, the heads of a donkey and an ox are visible. The background is a deep blue, possibly representing the night sky, with scattered gold stars. The shelter is suggested by a golden canopy supported by wooden beams and a green striped wall or curtain.",
