    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable structure. The Virgin Mary, adorned with a blue mantle and golden halo, is shown reclining on an orange cloth, her hands clasped in prayer. She gazes down at the Christ Child, who is lying in a manger, reaching upwards. To the right of Mary sits Saint Joseph, depicted as an elderly man with a white beard, wearing a blue head covering and a pink robe, his arms crossed. A white horse and a golden ox are present in the foreground, with the ox wearing a small crown. The stable has a thatched roof supported by wooden beams, and the background features a rocky landscape with some sparse vegetation. The entire scene is framed by a decorative border.",
