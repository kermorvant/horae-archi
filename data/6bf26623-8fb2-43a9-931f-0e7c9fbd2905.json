    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and bleeding from his wounds. To his left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle and with her hands clasped in sorrow. To his right is a younger figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also in blue and red garments, with his hand extended. The background is a landscape with rolling hills and a blue sky. The figures are rendered with delicate brushstrokes and highlighted with gold leaf.",
