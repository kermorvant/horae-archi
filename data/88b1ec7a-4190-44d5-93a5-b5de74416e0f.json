    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an elderly man with a long white beard, wearing a dark, ornate hat and a red and white robe, seated on a throne-like chair draped with blue fabric. He appears to be engaged in writing or examining something in his hands. To his right, a younger man in a reddish tunic and armbands holds a staff and a small grey bag. In the background, a small, nude child with outstretched arms is visible, seemingly floating or being held aloft. The overall setting is sparse, with a grey, textured wall behind the figures and a hint of architectural framing at the top.",
