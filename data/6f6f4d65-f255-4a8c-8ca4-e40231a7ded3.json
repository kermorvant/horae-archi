    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious gathering with several figures. In the foreground, a young woman in a red dress kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. She is accompanied by the Virgin Mary, who places a comforting hand on her shoulder. To the left, a bishop in red robes and a mitre stands on a raised platform, gesturing towards the kneeling woman. Behind the bishop, two men observe the scene. To the right, a bearded man in an orange robe stands with his arms crossed. In the background, a classical rotunda with a dome is visible, suggesting an architectural setting. The overall scene appears to be an act of supplication or divine intervention.",
