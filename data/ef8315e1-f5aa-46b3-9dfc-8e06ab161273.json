    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely God the Father, wearing a bishop's miter and holding a crown, gesturing with his right hand. Before him kneels the Virgin Mary, hands clasped in prayer, with an angel standing behind her. Another angel is shown above, reaching down to place a crown on the Virgin's head. The figures are set against a green, patterned backdrop, with a golden sunburst radiating from the upper left. The seated figure is positioned on a raised platform with steps, suggesting a throne-like setting.",
