    "scene_description_enriched": "Two knights stand facing each other, each holding a spear. The knight on the left wears a red surcoat over armor, with a helmet and a shield bearing a red and gold crest. The knight on the right wears a white surcoat with a red cross, also in armor with a helmet and a shield featuring a cross and decorative elements. Both figures are depicted against a blue background with a repeating geometric pattern of white squares and orange leaf-like motifs. Decorative borders frame the scene at the top and sides. The scene appears to be a symbolic representation rather than a specific narrative event.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Knights and heraldry often symbolize virtues, spiritual battles, or the patrons of the manuscript. Without further context or specific iconography, it's difficult to assign a precise biblical or devotional event. However, the presence of knights can allude to the concept of spiritual warfare or the defense of faith.",
