    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition from the Cross. Christ's body, pale and marked with wounds, is being carefully lowered from the cross by two men. One man, wearing a blue tunic and a red hat, supports Christ's torso, while another man in a brown robe holds Christ's arm. To the right, a woman in a blue robe and white veil, likely the Virgin Mary, supports Christ's legs. Another figure, possibly a disciple or a mourner, stands behind Christ. To the left, a man in a regal hat and ermine collar observes the scene. The background is a simple green landscape with a blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting.",
