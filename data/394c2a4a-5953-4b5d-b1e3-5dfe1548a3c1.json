    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man lying on a pyre, engulfed in flames, with a golden disc behind his head, suggesting martyrdom. He is being tormented by several figures. A seated figure, likely a king or judge, wearing a crown and royal blue robe, presides over the scene, holding a scepter. To the right, a jester-like figure in a red jester's hat holds a book and gestures towards the pyre. Two other figures actively torment the martyr: one pokes him with a stick, while another uses bellows to intensify the flames. The background is a richly patterned tapestry. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
