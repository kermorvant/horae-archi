    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely Christ, is seated on a wooden chair with a green draped back, reading from a lectern. The figure wears a blue robe and a white garment. To the left, a monkey-like creature sits on the floor, looking towards a scroll that unfurls from the lectern. The setting appears to be an interior space with pink walls and a checkered floor. Several arched windows with dark panes are visible along the upper wall. To the right, a wooden stand holds a green book with a grid pattern. The scene is framed by an arched border.",
