    "scene_description_enriched": "Two crowned figures, likely saints or holy figures, are depicted seated within an architectural frame. Both wear golden crowns and blue robes trimmed with gold, and hold books. The figure on the left gestures with an open hand, while the figure on the right raises two fingers in a gesture of blessing or teaching. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a golden orb. The background is a rich blue with gold ornamentation, and the figures are framed by an oval motif with pink and blue drapery. Below the figures, a stylized architectural element resembling a miniature arcade or screen is visible. The overall scene is highly decorative and symbolic, suggesting a theological or devotional theme.",
