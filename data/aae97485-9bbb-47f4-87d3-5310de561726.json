    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures surrounding a central figure who is blindfolded and seated. This central figure, identifiable as Christ, has a beard and long hair, and is wearing a simple tunic. He is being mocked and struck by the surrounding figures, who are depicted with varied expressions and gestures. One figure to the left is holding a stick and appears to be speaking to Christ, while others are gesturing towards him or touching him. Above the figures, architectural elements suggestive of a building's facade are visible, with decorative arches and pinnacles. The overall impression is one of torment and humiliation.",
