    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, depicted from the waist up, are shown seated or kneeling. They are dressed in long robes with distinct folds and pleats, suggesting a formal or religious context. The figures are arranged in a line, with their faces turned to the left, and their arms are crossed over their chests. The style is characteristic of woodcut illustrations, with bold outlines and hatching to create shading. No architectural elements or specific setting are visible, focusing entirely on the depiction of these individuals.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a group of faithful, possibly disciples or a congregation, engaged in prayer or contemplation. The solemn posture and unified arrangement suggest a moment of shared devotion or religious observance. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific biblical event cannot be definitively identified, but it evokes a sense of communal piety.",
