    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of people are depicted in distress, looking upwards towards a celestial event. The sky is a deep blue, filled with golden stars and streaks, suggesting a cosmic phenomenon. In the upper right corner, a hand, possibly divine, is shown holding a golden disc or orb. The figures below are shown in various states of anguish and awe, with some reaching their arms towards the sky. One man in a green tunic is particularly prominent, with his head tilted back and arms raised. Another figure, an older man with a white beard, lies prostrate on the ground, his face etched with suffering. The scene is set outdoors, with a hint of green ground beneath the figures.",
