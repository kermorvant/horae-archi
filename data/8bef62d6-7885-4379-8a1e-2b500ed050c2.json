    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures entering a building. On the left, several individuals are shown in motion, some with their arms raised. One figure wears a distinctive gold-patterned hat. In the center, a group of figures in red and white robes are approaching the entrance of a building. One figure in a red robe is being greeted by an older man with a long white beard, dressed in a blue robe, who stands within the doorway. Above the building, a figure in red, with a halo, is depicted in the sky, gesturing downwards. The background features a starry blue sky and architectural elements that suggest towers and buildings.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a biblical event, possibly the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, given the presence of figures entering a building and a divine figure above. The older man in blue could be Simeon, and the figures in red and white could be Mary and Joseph. The figure in the sky might represent God the Father or a divine messenger.",
