    "scene_description_enriched": "A youthful male saint, identified by a golden halo, stands in a landscape. He wears a white robe with gold trim and holds a palm frond in his left hand and a staff in his right. The background depicts a stylized forest with dark, dense foliage and slender trees, transitioning to rolling hills and distant architectural elements. In the foreground, a dark, barred fence separates the viewer from the saint, and scattered stones lie on the ground. The overall impression is one of serene contemplation within a pastoral setting, possibly representing a martyr or a holy figure in prayer or contemplation.",
