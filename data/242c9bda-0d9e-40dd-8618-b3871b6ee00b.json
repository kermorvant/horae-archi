    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures, likely the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child, in a devotional setting. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is seated and wearing a red mantle over a light-colored tunic, with a red headdress. She is looking down with a somber expression, holding an open book in her lap. The Christ Child, on the left, is dressed in a blue tunic and points to the text in the book, also with a halo indicating sanctity. Behind them, a column and a golden architectural element suggest an interior space, while a landscape with blue hills and a pale sky is visible in the background through an opening. The overall impression is one of quiet instruction and religious study.",
