    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act within an architectural setting. In the foreground, a figure in a blue cloak and white garment kneels with hands clasped in prayer before an altar or lectern, illuminated by a golden halo. Behind this kneeling figure, two men are engaged in a struggle. One man, wearing a blue cap and red tunic, strikes another man, who is dressed in a grey tunic and red cap, with a hammer. A third man, in a blue tunic and red cap, stands behind them, observing. The background reveals a brick wall with arched windows and vaulted ceilings supported by columns, suggesting an interior space. The floor is tiled in a blue and white checkerboard pattern. The overall scene appears to be a martyrdom or violent persecution of a devout individual.",
