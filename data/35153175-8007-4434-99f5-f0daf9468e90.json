    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pentecost, with the Virgin Mary and the Apostles gathered in an interior space. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from above, surrounded by fiery rays. The figures are arranged in a semi-circle, with Mary in the center, looking towards the viewer. Two figures in the upper register, possibly prophets or Old Testament figures, are shown reading from a book. The architecture includes arched windows and ornate golden structures, suggesting a sacred or important building. The overall impression is one of divine inspiration and the transmission of spiritual power.",
