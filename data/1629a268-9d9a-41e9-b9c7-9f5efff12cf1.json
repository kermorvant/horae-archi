    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint, stands in a landscape, holding a golden vessel containing a plant or branch. She wears a flowing rose-colored robe trimmed with gold. In the background, to the left, a dark, multi-tiered building resembling a castle or fortified structure is depicted. To the right, a body of water with green foliage is visible. The scene is set outdoors with elements of nature and architecture.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure holding a vessel with a plant could represent a saint associated with healing or a specific botanical element, or it might allude to the Tree of Life or a similar symbolic motif. Without further iconographic context, a precise interpretation is difficult, but it evokes a devotional scene set in a natural environment.",
