    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in what appears to be an interior setting with architectural elements. On the left, a bearded man wears a distinctive hat and has his hands clasped in prayer. To his right, a woman, also with clasped hands, looks towards the viewer. Behind her, another figure, possibly male, is partially visible, wearing a headdress. The background features stylized architectural details, including what could be arches and decorative elements suggesting a building. The overall impression is one of devotion or supplication.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a devotional moment, possibly a prayer or a plea, given the clasped hands of the figures. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or liturgical event cannot be definitively identified. However, the presence of multiple figures engaged in prayer suggests a communal or personal act of faith.",
