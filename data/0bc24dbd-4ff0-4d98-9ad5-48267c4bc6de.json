    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King Herod, seated on a throne adorned with gold and red tassels, gesturing towards a woman in a yellow gown who is recoiling in horror. The woman's arms are raised in distress, and she appears to be witnessing a massacre. Around her, soldiers in armor are shown brutally killing infants, whose bodies lie strewn on the ground, covered in blood. In the background, a city with numerous buildings and towers is visible under a bright blue sky, with distant mountains. The scene is framed by an ornate golden curtain on the left and a wooden structure on the far left.",
