    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious narrative unfolding within a partially visible architectural setting. On the left, three figures stand together. One figure, likely a saint due to the halo, is positioned between two other individuals. The central figure is looking upwards with hands outstretched in supplication or awe. To the right, a figure stands within an arched doorway, gesturing outwards. The background shows a stylized landscape with trees and a small building. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine intervention or communication.",
