    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in conversation, framed by decorative borders. The woman on the left wears a blue robe and has blonde hair, her head tilted downwards with a somber expression. The woman on the right is cloaked in red, her face partially obscured by her hood, and she gestures with her hands as if speaking. They stand on a checkered floor, with a patterned background behind them featuring circular motifs. The overall impression is one of intimate dialogue, possibly within a domestic or sacred setting, suggested by the architectural framing and the solemnity of the figures.",
