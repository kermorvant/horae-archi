    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and gold halo, holds the Christ Child on her lap. One of the Magi, dressed in black and gold, kneels before them, presenting a golden chalice. Another Magus, in green and wearing a crown, offers a golden vessel. A third Magus, in pink and white, holds a crown aloft. Behind them, other figures and horses are visible, suggesting a procession. The setting appears to be a stable or rudimentary shelter, indicated by wooden beams and a draped orange cloth with gold leaf patterns. In the background, a landscape with trees and a distant fortified structure can be seen.",
