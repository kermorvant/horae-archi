    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large red wings and a blue robe, kneels and gestures towards the Virgin Mary. Rays of light emanate from Gabriel towards Mary, who is seated on the right, dressed in a blue robe over a pink and red garment, and appears to be reading from a book. Behind Mary, a richly decorated canopy with patterned fabric and columns is visible. The setting appears to be an interior space with an arched doorway in the background, through which a glimpse of a brick-like structure can be seen. Above the figures, there are hints of architectural elements and possibly celestial beings.",
