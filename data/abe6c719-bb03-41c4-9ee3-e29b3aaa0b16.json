    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine revelation. Christ, with a halo and radiating golden rays from his hand, stands on the left. He is gesturing upwards, seemingly bestowing a blessing or imparting knowledge. To the right, an older man with a white beard, also with a halo, looks towards Christ and raises his hands in supplication or reception. In the foreground, a bearded man kneels with clasped hands, facing a large open book inscribed with text. The background is a richly patterned mosaic of red, blue, and gold squares, suggesting a celestial or sacred space. The ground beneath the figures is green and appears to be grassy.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a divine revelation or the imparting of divine law. The presence of Christ, the supplicating figures, and the open book suggest a moment of spiritual enlightenment or the transmission of sacred knowledge. This could be interpreted as a representation of God revealing himself to a prophet or a saint, or perhaps the moment of inspiration for the scriptures.",
