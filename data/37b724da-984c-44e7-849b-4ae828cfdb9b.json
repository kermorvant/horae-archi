    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral setting with four figures and several sheep. On the left, a person in a red and gold tunic and blue hood is kneeling, holding a bowl. Next to them, a woman in a blue dress and white head covering is also kneeling, holding a bowl and a spoon, and appears to be eating or feeding. In the center, a figure in a brown and gold hooded garment is kneeling, looking towards the woman. On the right, a person in a blue and red garment is seated, drinking from a vessel. Sheep are visible in the background. The overall impression is one of a simple meal or gathering in a rural environment.",
