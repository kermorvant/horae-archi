    "scene_description_enriched": "A seated female figure, likely a saint, is depicted within an architectural niche. She wears a veil and a draped garment. In her left hand, she holds a human skull, a common symbol of mortality and penance. Her right hand rests on a pedestal supporting a small, framed image, possibly a relic or a devotional icon. The figure is seated on a cushioned surface, with her feet resting on a prostrate figure, suggesting subjugation or triumph over an adversary. The background is filled with stippling, creating a textured effect. Above the figure, an ornate architectural canopy with pointed arches and microarchitecture frames the scene. A banner with Gothic lettering is visible at the very top.",
