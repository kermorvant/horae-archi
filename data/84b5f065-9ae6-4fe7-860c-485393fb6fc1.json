    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, likely a saint, stands centrally within an arched frame. He is depicted with a beard, wearing a blue robe over a red tunic and a grey cap. He holds a book in his left hand and a staff topped with a lantern in his right. The background is divided into two sections: the upper part features a gold diamond pattern with red and white accents, and the lower part displays a green diamond pattern with gold accents. The overall presentation suggests a devotional image, possibly representing a saint associated with pilgrimage or a specific religious order.",
