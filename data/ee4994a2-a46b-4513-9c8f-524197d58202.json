    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable structure. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, kneels in prayer to the left, facing a manger where the Christ Child lies. To the right, Saint Joseph, bearded and cloaked, also kneels, looking towards the child. A cow and an ox are present, with the ox's head visible near the child. Above and behind them, a group of onlookers, some with hats and spears, observe the scene. In the background, a detailed cityscape with various buildings, including towers and houses, is depicted, suggesting the event takes place near a town. Angels are shown in the upper left, possibly announcing the birth. The overall setting is a blend of the humble stable and the distant, more elaborate urban environment.",
