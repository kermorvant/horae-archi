    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a landscape. In the upper portion, a figure in dark robes kneels in prayer on a rocky, barren ground, with sparse trees in the background. Below this, a scene unfolds with several figures, some appearing to be soldiers in armor, gathered around a central object. This object appears to be a table or altar-like structure, upon which rests a crown and various weapons, including spears and swords. One figure, possibly a king or important person, is depicted with a crown and is surrounded by others. In the lower part of the image, a body of water is visible, with a suggestion of a landscape beyond. The overall impression is one of a dramatic event, possibly a battle or a scene of judgment, set within a natural environment.",
