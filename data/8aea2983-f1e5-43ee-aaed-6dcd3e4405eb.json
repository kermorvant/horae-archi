    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the creation of Eve and the temptation in the Garden of Eden. On the left, Adam is being formed from the earth by a figure in a blue robe, identified as God, who is surrounded by a golden halo. Nearby, Eve is being created from Adam's rib. To the right, Adam and Eve stand before a tree with a serpent coiled around it, offering the forbidden fruit. A winged figure, likely an angel or a representation of temptation, stands behind them. In the background, two elaborate Gothic architectural structures with spires and intricate tracery are visible, set against a lush green landscape with trees and a blue sky. The foreground shows a rocky, mountainous terrain meeting a body of water.",
