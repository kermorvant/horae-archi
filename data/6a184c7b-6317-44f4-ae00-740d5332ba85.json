    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural frame. On the left, a woman with a halo and flowing hair, likely the Virgin Mary, holds a book and gestures towards the other figure. On the right, an older woman, possibly Saint Elizabeth, with a veiled head and a more somber expression, looks towards the first woman and holds a small object, perhaps a scroll or a vial. Behind them, a stylized cityscape with towers and crenellated walls is visible. The scene is framed by an arched structure with decorative elements, suggesting an interior or a covered exterior space.",
