    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Archangel Michael in full armor, holding a cross aloft in his right hand and a spear in his left, poised to strike. He is shown in a dynamic pose, with his left leg forward and his right leg bent, suggesting movement and combat. His large, feathered wings are spread wide. He is clad in a tunic, a sash, and greaves, and wears a halo. The background is a tapestry of fleur-de-lis. At the bottom of the image, a defeated dragon or serpent lies prostrate, its scales and wings visible, being trampled by Michael's foot. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with foliate motifs.",
