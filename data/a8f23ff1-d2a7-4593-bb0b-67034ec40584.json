    "scene_description_enriched": "A man in full armor, with a long grey hair and a serene expression, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer before an open book resting on a green draped lectern. He is positioned within a richly decorated tent-like structure, suggested by the draped blue and pink fabric and the gold decorative elements. Behind him, a tapestry-like background features intricate gold patterns. To the right of the kneeling figure, a plumed helmet rests on the ground, indicating his martial status. The overall scene suggests a moment of private devotion, possibly before or after a battle, or as part of a daily prayer ritual.",
