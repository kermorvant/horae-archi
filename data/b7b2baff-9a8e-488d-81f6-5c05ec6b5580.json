This figure wields a staff or club, striking down the figures below. To the left, a figure with raised arms appears to be either defending or pleading. The overall impression is one of torment and suffering, with several figures appearing distressed or dead. The background is filled with stylized clouds, suggesting an otherworldly or tumultuous setting.",
