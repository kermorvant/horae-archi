He is draped in a blue tunic and a pink mantle. The background is divided into two sections: the left side features a cloudy, blue sky, while the right side shows a patterned blue surface, possibly representing water or a celestial realm. In the lower left, there are indications of architectural elements, specifically steps or a tiled floor, suggesting a ground level.",
