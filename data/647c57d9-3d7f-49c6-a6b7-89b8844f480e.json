    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel, with golden wings and a halo, descends from a starry sky, holding a scroll that reads 'uer. nae. eft. n'. Below, a pastoral scene unfolds with shepherds and their flock. One shepherd, seated and wearing a red tunic, plays a bagpipe. Another shepherd, standing and dressed in blue with a red collar, looks upwards with clasped hands, while a woman in a white gown and blue headdress stands beside him. Sheep graze in the foreground, and a dog lies near them. In the background, a fortified castle with towers sits beside a body of water, surrounded by rolling green hills and trees.",
