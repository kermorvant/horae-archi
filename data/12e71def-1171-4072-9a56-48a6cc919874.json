    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a nude figure, possibly a woman, seated on a draped surface. She has long hair and is looking to the right. Behind her, foliage and what appear to be grapes are visible. The figure's posture suggests she is either reclining or in the process of sitting down. The scene is framed by decorative elements, suggesting it is an illustration within a larger work. The overall impression is one of a pastoral or allegorical scene, possibly related to nature or fertility.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Nudity in medieval art can symbolize innocence, purity, or vulnerability. The presence of foliage and grapes might allude to themes of nature, abundance, or even the Garden of Eden. Without further context, a definitive interpretation is challenging, but it could represent a figure from classical mythology, an allegory of a season, or a symbolic representation of a virtue or vice.",
