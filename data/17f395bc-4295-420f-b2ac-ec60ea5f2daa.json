    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian. A haloed figure, presumably Saint Sebastian, kneels in the foreground, wearing a dark cloak over a white tunic. His left hand is raised in a gesture of prayer or acceptance, while his right hand points downwards. Two figures, dressed in contemporary medieval attire, stand behind him. The figure on the left holds a sword raised as if to strike, while the figure on the right appears to be holding a bow or a similar weapon. In the background, a landscape unfolds with a body of water, trees, and a distant city with towers and spires, bathed in a radiant light from above. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with foliage.",
