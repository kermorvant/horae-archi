Before her is an altar draped with a white cloth over a patterned red cloth. To the right, a man in a green robe and a tall, conical blue hat holds the Christ Child, who is depicted with a halo. Behind him stands another man in a blue robe. To the left of the Virgin, two women are present; one holds a bowl containing two doves, a reference to the purification offering. The background features a red tapestry with gold ornamentation and arched windows with tracery. The ceiling is visible, with visible wooden beams.",
