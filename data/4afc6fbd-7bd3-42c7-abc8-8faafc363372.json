    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a landscape setting. One figure, lying down, appears to be in repose or possibly deceased, with a head resting on a surface. Another figure, standing, is partially visible, with a blue garment and a red arm and hand extended. The background suggests a sky with some indistinct forms. The overall impression is one of a narrative scene, possibly religious, given the context of a Book of Hours.",
