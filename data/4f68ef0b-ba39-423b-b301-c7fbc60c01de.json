    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, all with golden halos, are depicted. The central figure, an older man with a white beard, wears a golden robe and holds open a book with musical notation. To his left, another figure in a blue robe looks towards the central figure. To the right of the central figure, a man in a blue robe with red trim gestures with his raised hand. Behind these figures, more halos suggest a larger gathering. The background is a rich red tapestry with a gold diamond pattern, and a sliver of green ground is visible at the bottom right. This scene likely represents a gathering of saints or apostles, possibly engaged in prayer or discussion, with the central figure perhaps being a composer or a significant biblical figure.",
