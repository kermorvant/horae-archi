    "scene_description_enriched": "A skeletal figure, representing Death, reaches out to touch a man who is seated on a chest or sarcophagus, his mouth open in a cry of distress. The man is dressed in contemporary medieval attire and holds a small vessel in his hand. Behind him, two other figures, possibly mourners or onlookers, are depicted with expressions of concern or resignation. The scene is set outdoors, with stylized foliage and flowers in the foreground and background, suggesting a natural, albeit somewhat abstract, environment. The presence of the skeletal figure and the distressed man points to a theme of mortality and the inevitability of death.",
