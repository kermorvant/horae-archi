    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial gathering, divided into three tiers. The uppermost tier features two elderly figures with halos, one holding a globe and gesturing with two fingers, the other looking upwards. Between them, a dove descends from a radiant light, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. Below this, two figures with halos are shown looking upwards in prayer against a red background with golden star-like motifs. The lowest tier shows a group of seven figures, all with halos and praying with clasped hands, also against a red background. The figures are dressed in robes of various colors, including blue, pink, and green. The lowest part of the image shows a green landscape with sparse vegetation. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with floral decorations.",
