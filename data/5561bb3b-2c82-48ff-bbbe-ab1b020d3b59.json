    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and a golden halo, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child. Joseph, an elderly man with a white beard and a red cap, walks behind, carrying a bundle on his shoulder. An angel with vibrant orange wings and a white tunic, also barefoot, walks alongside the donkey, gesturing forward. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling green hills and a tree, set against a deep blue sky with gold flecks, suggesting a celestial or divine presence.",
