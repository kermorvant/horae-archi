    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a stylized, open-air pavilion. The Angel Gabriel, with large feathered wings and a golden halo, kneels on the left, holding a scroll with an inscription. He is dressed in a red robe and kneels on a white cushion. Facing him on the right is the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, wearing a blue robe and a white veil. She is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, looking towards the angel, and stands before a lectern. Between them, a lily stands in a vase, symbolizing purity. Above the pavilion, a divine figure with multiple wings, possibly God the Father, is depicted in a radiant blue sky. In the background, a detailed architectural structure resembling a tower or castle is visible. The ground is tiled with a geometric pattern. The overall scene is framed by decorative floral elements typical of manuscript illumination.",
