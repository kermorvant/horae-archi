    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an interior space. A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and vestments, kneels and receives communion from a chalice. He is attended by two other figures, likely clergy or laymen, who look on with reverence. In the background, a figure, possibly a saint or a divine manifestation, stands behind a barrier, with arms raised. An altar is set with a book and a chalice. The overall setting suggests a liturgical event, possibly a Mass or a vision during a Mass.",
