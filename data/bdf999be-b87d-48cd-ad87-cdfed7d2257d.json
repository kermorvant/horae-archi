Below, three shepherds are depicted in a pastoral landscape. The shepherd on the left, in a red tunic and blue leggings, looks up at the angel with outstretched arms. The shepherd in the center, wearing a blue tunic and pink head covering, also looks upwards, while the third shepherd on the right, in a brown cloak, turns away. Several sheep are scattered around the shepherds. In the background, stylized buildings with blue roofs and towers are visible, suggesting a town or city.",
