    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body pale and marked with wounds, wearing a loincloth. To his left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, her hands clasped in prayer and her head bowed in sorrow. To his right is a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, clad in a golden robe, with hands raised in supplication. The setting is an outdoor landscape with trees and a distant city skyline under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
