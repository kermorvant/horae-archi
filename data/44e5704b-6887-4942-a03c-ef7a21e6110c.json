    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, dressed in royal attire with a blue and green striped robe and a fur-trimmed collar, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. Before him lies a crown on a cushion, and to his left, a harp. He looks upwards towards a divine figure depicted within a celestial orb, radiating golden light. The scene appears to be set within an architectural structure, suggested by an ornate archway and a draped tapestry with a fleur-de-lis pattern. Beyond the architecture, a landscape with trees and a body of water is visible, with distant buildings. The overall impression is one of supplication and divine communication.",
