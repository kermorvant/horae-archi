    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, meeting Elizabeth, who is kneeling and wearing a golden gown and a white veil. They are holding hands, suggesting a moment of embrace and recognition. Behind them, a rocky landscape transitions to a settlement with several buildings, including a prominent tower and a larger structure with a red roof and multiple windows. The sky is a vibrant blue, and the overall setting appears to be outdoors, possibly on a hillside overlooking a town or castle.",
