    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and beard, seated and gesturing towards an open book placed on a lectern. He wears a red tunic and a blue mantle. To his right, an angel with blue wings kneels, looking up at Christ and holding a book. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by a series of arches supported by columns. Beyond the arches, a landscape with trees and hills is visible. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern. This scene likely represents Christ teaching or expounding scripture, possibly to an angelic audience or as a representation of divine wisdom.",
