    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, likely a saint given the halo, stands in a landscape. He wears a patterned golden robe over a white tunic and a green mantle. In his right hand, he holds a book open, displaying musical notation. His left hand holds a dark, slender object, possibly a stylus or a musical instrument part, resting on a dark railing. The background depicts rolling hills and distant mountains under a blue sky. The figure's attire and the musical notation suggest a connection to music or liturgy.",
