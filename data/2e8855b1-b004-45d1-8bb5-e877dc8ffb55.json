    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint, stands within an architectural frame. She wears a draped garment and a cloak fastened at the neck. Her left hand holds a vessel, possibly a censer or a reliquary, while her right hand is positioned near her chest. The background is filled with a dense pattern of dots, suggesting foliage or a decorative motif, with a hint of landscape elements at the bottom. Above her, an arched structure, possibly part of a larger architectural setting, frames the scene. The overall impression is one of devotional representation, possibly depicting a saint associated with a specific relic or liturgical practice.",
