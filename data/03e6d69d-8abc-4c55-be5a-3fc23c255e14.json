    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male figure, identified as a prophet, stands centrally, holding a red book in his left hand and a curved blade in his right. He wears a pink mantle over a golden tunic and blue undergarment. A golden halo encircles his head, and he is depicted against a patterned background of gold squares interspersed with blue and red diamonds. Below him, a green architectural element, possibly a throne or altar, is visible, resting on a checkered orange and red surface. The overall scene is framed by decorative borders.",
