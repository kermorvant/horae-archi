The figure on the left wears a pink tunic and an orange cloak, holding a book in his left hand and gesturing with his right. The figure on the right wears an orange robe and a red cap, holding a book and a staff, with a small pouch slung over his shoulder. Both figures are depicted in an outdoor setting with stylized green ground and foliage at the bottom. Above them is a blue arch with radiating lines, suggesting divine light, and decorative floral motifs on a gold border.",
