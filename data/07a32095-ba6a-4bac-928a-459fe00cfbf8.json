    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a kneeling woman, likely Mary Magdalene, with a halo, facing a standing figure of Christ, who is shown with wounds and a draped cloth. Christ extends his hand towards the woman. In the background, a tree stands to the left, and a walled city with towers is visible on the horizon. The figures are positioned in an outdoor setting, with a tomb or altar-like structure in the foreground. The inscription at the bottom suggests a devotional context, possibly related to the \"Noli me tangere\" moment.",
