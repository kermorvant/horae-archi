Two winged angels, rendered in gold, are positioned above her, holding a golden crown. Below Mary, partially visible, are the heads and shoulders of several other figures, also appearing to be angels, with blue skin and golden wings. The overall impression is one of celestial reverence and the coronation of the Virgin.",
