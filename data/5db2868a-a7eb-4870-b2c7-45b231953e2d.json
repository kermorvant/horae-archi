    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female figure, likely a saint, is depicted in a three-quarter profile, looking towards the viewer's left. She wears a golden crown, a brown undergarment, and a rich blue mantle lined with red. Her right hand holds a sword upright, its hilt adorned with a dark knob. Her left hand rests on her abdomen. Behind her, a stylized landscape unfolds with rolling green hills, scattered blue trees, and a distant, simplified castle structure. The sky is a bright blue with wispy, dark clouds. A golden halo surrounds her head, and a golden plume-like element extends upwards from behind her right shoulder. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
