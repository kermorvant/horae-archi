    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, dressed in dark robes, holds the Christ Child on her lap. She gestures with her right hand, her palm open. Before them kneels a bearded man, presumably one of the Magi, offering a gift. Behind him stand two other figures, also likely Magi, one holding a child. The figures are set against a dark background, with hints of architectural elements and a landscape in the upper portion, suggesting an outdoor setting or a partially enclosed space.",
