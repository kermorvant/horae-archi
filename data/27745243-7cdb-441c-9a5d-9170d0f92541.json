    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, stands to the right, gesturing with his left hand towards a group of three young boys submerged in a wooden tub. The boys, depicted with halos, appear to be praying or in a state of supplication. Behind them, a pink textile, possibly a curtain or tapestry, is adorned with golden sunburst motifs. The scene is framed by a decorative border, and architectural elements suggesting an interior setting are visible at the top, including a patterned frieze and what appears to be a window with blue and grey panes.",
