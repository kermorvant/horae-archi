    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely Christ, stands barefoot and robed, holding a spherical object resembling a globe or orb. The figure's gaze is directed downwards towards this object. Behind the figure, two large, dark spheres are depicted. The upper sphere contains celestial bodies: a radiant sun and a crescent moon, along with numerous stars. The lower sphere is dark and appears to represent the earth or a void. The background is decorated with an ornate, swirling pattern. This scene is interpreted as the Creation of the World, with Christ depicted as the divine creator.",
