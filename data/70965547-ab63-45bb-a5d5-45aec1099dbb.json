    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a coronation ceremony, likely of the Virgin Mary, within an opulent interior. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. To her right, a bearded figure, possibly Christ, points towards her. Two winged figures, likely angels, hover above, holding a golden crown. Below them, two figures play trumpets, adding to the ceremonial atmosphere. The background is a rich red tapestry with gold ornamentation. Above the tapestry, architectural elements suggest a vaulted ceiling with decorative windows.",
