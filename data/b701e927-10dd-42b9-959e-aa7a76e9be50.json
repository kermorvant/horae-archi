    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border with stylized vegetal motifs and what appear to be grotesque figures or animals. The overall impression is one of intricate ornamentation rather than a narrative scene. The figures are rendered in a black-and-white woodcut style, with hatching used to create shading and form. There are no discernible architectural elements or a clear setting that would suggest a specific location or event.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image does not depict a specific religious, biblical, liturgical, or devotional scene. It appears to be a decorative border or initial, possibly from a Book of Hours, intended to embellish the text rather than illustrate a narrative.",
