    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men are gathered, some wearing elaborate hats. One man in a yellow tunic and green hose is stepping onto a stone structure, his back to the viewer. Another man with a long white beard, wearing a blue and red robe and a pointed blue hat, gestures towards him. The scene appears to be indoors, with a patterned floor and a wooden ceiling visible. The overall impression is one of a gathering or a significant event, possibly a religious or judicial one, given the attire and the solemn expressions.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is not clearly identifiable as a specific biblical or devotional event based solely on the visual information. The presence of multiple figures in distinct attire, one of whom appears to be in a position of authority or judgment (the bearded man with the pointed hat), could suggest a scene from the Old Testament, a legal proceeding, or a council. However, without further context or clearer iconography, a definitive interpretation is not possible.",
