    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, is seated on a bed of straw, holding the Christ Child. Three Magi, identified by their crowns and rich attire, approach. The first, kneeling, offers a golden chalice. The second, in a purple robe, holds a similar offering. The third, with dark skin and a red and gold patterned robe, also carries a chalice. Behind them, a rough stone wall and wooden beams suggest the stable's structure. A star shines in the blue sky above.",
