    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Last Judgment. Christ, with wounds visible on his body, is enthroned in the upper register, surrounded by a radiant halo and seated on a globe. Below him, an angel descends, holding a trumpet. To the left and right of Christ are groups of figures, likely apostles or saints, seated on ornate benches. In the lower register, souls are being judged: on the left, angels guide souls upwards, while on the right, a monstrous demon presides over a pit of fire where souls are being tormented. The overall setting is celestial and infernal, framed by architectural elements suggestive of a Gothic archway.",
