    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a flock of sheep resting on a grassy hill. A shepherd, dressed in a red tunic and blue trousers, lies on the ground, looking upwards with his arms outstretched. Beside him, a dog stands alert. Another figure, possibly a monk or a traveler, stands over the shepherd, leaning on a staff and looking towards the sky. Above them, a winged, golden figure, possibly an angel or a divine messenger, descends from a blue, star-filled sky, holding a scroll. In the background, a walled city with towers and a church spire is visible.",
