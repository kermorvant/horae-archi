He holds an open book in his left hand and points with his right index finger towards the text. The background is a vibrant blue with scattered gold flecks, suggesting a celestial or divine setting. The text within the frame, though partially obscured, appears to be Latin script. The overall composition suggests a learned figure, possibly a prophet or a scholar engaged in contemplation or teaching.",
