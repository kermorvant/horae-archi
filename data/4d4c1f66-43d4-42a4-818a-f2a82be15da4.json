They are seated on a wooden bench within an architectural space that features vaulted ceilings and decorative gold elements. All figures are looking upwards with hands clasped in prayer or raised in supplication. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a golden, starry sky, with rays of light emanating downwards. The architectural setting is ornate, suggesting a sacred or important interior space.",
