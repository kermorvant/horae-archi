    "scene_description_enriched": "A saintly figure, likely a bishop or abbot, stands centrally, clad in a black monastic habit and wearing a jeweled mitre and halo. He holds an open book in his left hand and a crosier in his right, with a white cloth draped over it. To his left, a man in a black habit kneels with hands clasped in prayer. To his right, a woman in a red gown and black head covering also kneels with hands clasped. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that suggests a church interior, with ornate golden structures resembling choir stalls or a reredos behind them. The background features blue walls with decorative patterns and arched windows. The overall scene depicts a devotional encounter, possibly a saint interceding for the kneeling figures.",
