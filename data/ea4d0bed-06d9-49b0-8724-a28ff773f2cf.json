    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and bearing the weight of the cross, being led through a city by a procession of soldiers in armor. Christ is shown with a halo, indicating his divinity, and his face is marked by suffering. The soldiers, armed with spears, surround him, some pulling at his robe with ropes. In the background, a walled city with towers and battlements is visible, suggesting the procession is moving towards a place of execution. To the left, two women, possibly the Virgin Mary and another follower, are depicted with halos, observing the procession with sorrow. The overall setting is outdoors, with a rocky, uneven terrain.",
