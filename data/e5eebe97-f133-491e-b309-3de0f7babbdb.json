    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in a blue cope with gold trim and a white mitre, stands holding an open book with musical notation. He gestures with his right hand towards a radiant, patterned background composed of gold, red, and blue squares, from which golden rays emanate. Behind him, a procession of three figures, also holding books, follows. The figures are dressed in blue and gold robes, and their faces are turned upwards, suggesting prayer or contemplation. The lower part of the scene depicts a grassy ground.",
