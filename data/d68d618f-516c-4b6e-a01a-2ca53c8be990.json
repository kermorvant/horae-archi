    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border featuring a repeating pattern of circular motifs, some resembling stylized flowers or rosettes, interspersed with smaller circular elements. In the center of the visible portion, a grotesque or monstrous face is depicted, characterized by wide eyes, a prominent nose, and a gaping mouth. The overall style suggests a woodcut or similar print technique, common in medieval manuscripts for borders and initial letters.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image does not depict a specific religious or biblical scene. Instead, it appears to be a decorative element, possibly an initial letter or a border, from a medieval manuscript. The grotesque face is likely an example of a marginalia or a decorative motif rather than an iconographic representation of a religious figure or event.",
