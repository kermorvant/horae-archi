    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Betrayal of Christ, with Judas Iscariot kissing Jesus to identify him to the arresting soldiers. Jesus, with a golden halo, is embraced by Judas, who wears a red robe. A crowd of soldiers, many in armor and helmets, surround them, some wielding swords and clubs. One soldier in the foreground, dressed in green, is wounded and bleeding. In the background, a wooden structure with a thatched roof is visible, and a figure in blue armor stands within it, holding a torch. The landscape behind is hilly, with trees and distant spires suggesting a town or city.",
