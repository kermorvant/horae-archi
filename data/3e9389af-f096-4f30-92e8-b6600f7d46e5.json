    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned king, identified as David, kneeling in prayer with his hands clasped. He is richly attired in a blue robe with a red mantle lined with ermine, and wears a golden crown. To his left lies a golden harp. The background features a rocky landscape with trees and birds, including cranes and swans. Above, in a celestial vision framed by fiery red seraphim, a bearded figure, likely God the Father, is depicted. In the distance, a walled city with numerous towers and spires is visible, with a procession of figures and horse-drawn carts moving towards it. The overall scene is set within an arched frame decorated with floral motifs and gold leaf.",
