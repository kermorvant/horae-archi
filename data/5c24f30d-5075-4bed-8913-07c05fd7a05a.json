    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bearded male figure wearing a crown of thorns and a halo, suggesting a religious context. He has long, wavy hair and is adorned with a jeweled ornament on his chest. His arms are raised, with open palms facing outward, in a gesture that could signify blessing, supplication, or lamentation. Two eight-pointed stars are positioned on either side of his head, within the frame. The style is that of a woodcut illustration, with bold lines and minimal detail.",
