    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in a richly decorated blue and gold robe, raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing or teaching. He holds a cross-topped staff. Before him kneels a young, naked boy, his hands clasped in prayer and a red and gold sash draped around his body. The scene appears to be set within an architectural space, suggested by a tiled floor and a window opening to a green landscape with trees. The bishop's attire and the boy's supplicating posture suggest a devotional scene, possibly depicting a saint interceding for a petitioner or a moment of spiritual guidance.",
