    "scene_description_enriched": "This image depicts a decorative border composed of repeating circular motifs interspersed with stylized vegetal elements and grotesque figures. The central motif features a creature with a prominent eye and what appears to be a mane or headdress, rendered in a woodcut style. The overall impression is one of ornamental design rather than a narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This is a decorative border, likely from a Book of Hours, intended to frame text or an illustration. The grotesque figures are common in medieval marginalia and decorative elements, often serving an aesthetic or symbolic purpose related to warding off evil or representing the chaotic forces of the world contrasted with the sacred text.",
