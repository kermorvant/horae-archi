    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition from the Cross. Christ's body, pale and marked with wounds, is being carefully lowered from the cross by a figure standing on a ladder. Another figure, possibly Joseph of Arimathea, supports Christ's legs. To the right, a group of mourners, including the Virgin Mary in blue and a figure in red holding a book, stand in sorrow. In the background, a stylized city with towers and buildings is visible. The ground is rendered as green, suggesting an outdoor setting.",
