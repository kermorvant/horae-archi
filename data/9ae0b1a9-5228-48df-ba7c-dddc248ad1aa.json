    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act within an architectural setting. Three figures are prominently displayed. The central figure, a man in a hooded garment, is being held by two other men who appear to be soldiers or guards. One soldier, on the left, wears armor and a helmet, and holds the hooded man's arm. The other soldier, on the right, is raising a sword or dagger towards the hooded man's neck. A fourth figure, partially obscured, is visible behind the first soldier. The background suggests an interior space with a ribbed or arched ceiling and vertical elements that could represent a wall or drapery. A jug or vessel is visible on the ground in the lower right corner. The overall impression is one of capture and imminent execution or martyrdom.",
