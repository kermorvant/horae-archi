    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely a saint or a devout figure, stands in a landscape. She wears a dark veil and a long, pink, patterned gown. Her left hand is raised, pointing outwards, while her right hand is held lower, palm open. The background depicts a stylized landscape with rolling blue hills, a distant tower-like structure, and a tree laden with red fruit on the right. The overall impression is one of contemplation or a narrative moment within a devotional context.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The gesture of pointing and the contemplative pose suggest a moment of revelation, prophecy, or instruction. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or hagiographic scene cannot be definitively identified, but it aligns with devotional imagery common in Books of Hours.",
