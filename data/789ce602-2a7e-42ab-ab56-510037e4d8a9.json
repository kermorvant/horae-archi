    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ's body, bloodied and pale, is being carefully lowered by several figures. One man in a blue tunic supports Christ's torso from above, while another, dressed in green and wearing a black hat, holds Christ's legs. A third figure in an orange garment stands on a ladder, reaching to support Christ. Below, a woman in a blue mantle, presumably the Virgin Mary, sits with her hands clasped, looking up at her son with sorrow. The background is a rich red tapestry with gold ornamentation, suggesting an indoor setting or a symbolic representation of a sacred space. The ground is depicted as green, possibly representing Golgotha.",
