    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Peter, identifiable by his halo and the keys he holds, standing within an architectural setting. He is dressed in a blue robe and holds an open book. Behind him, a patterned red tapestry hangs on the wall, and a wooden table holds stacks of books. The architecture includes arched windows with tracery, columns, and a vaulted ceiling structure above. To the right, an open archway reveals a glimpse of an outdoor landscape with rolling hills and trees. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. The overall scene suggests a devotional or narrative context, likely within a church or a scholarly setting.",
