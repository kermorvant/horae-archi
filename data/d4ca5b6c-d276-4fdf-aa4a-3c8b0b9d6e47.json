    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within a dark, possibly interior, setting. On the left, a bearded man with a halo stands, gesturing with his left hand. In the center, a woman holds two infants. The infants appear to be looking upwards. Behind them, another figure, possibly male, is visible, also with a halo. The overall impression is of a religious scene, likely depicting a biblical or devotional moment. The dark background and limited architectural detail suggest a focus on the figures and their spiritual significance.",
