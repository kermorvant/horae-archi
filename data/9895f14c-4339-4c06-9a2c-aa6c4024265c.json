    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in the foreground holding an open book. He is richly robed in gold and blue vestments. Behind him, a stylized landscape with green foliage is visible, and in the distance, a cluster of buildings with towers suggests a city or town. The figure's gaze is directed slightly to the viewer's left, and his expression is serene. The scene is likely a depiction of a saintly bishop, possibly Saint Nicholas or another prominent church figure, emphasizing his role as a spiritual leader and scholar.",
