    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and cope, stands to the right of a large wooden tub containing three nude boys. The bishop holds a crozier in his left hand and raises his right hand, seemingly in blessing or admonishment. The boys are depicted with their hands clasped in prayer or supplication. The background is a decorative tapestry with a geometric pattern. This scene likely depicts Saint Nicholas of Myra, a bishop known for his miracles, possibly related to saving children.",
