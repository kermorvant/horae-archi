    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a saint, lying on the ground, draped in a blue robe with gold trim and a pink undergarment. A rope is tied around their neck, and two men, one in blue and pink, the other in red, are pulling it. The figure has a halo, indicating sainthood. Behind them, a walled city with various buildings, including towers and houses with pitched roofs, is visible. The foreground features a low, crenellated wall. The inscription \"S Maze\" is present, suggesting the identity of the figure as Saint \"M\"aze, possibly a martyr. This scene likely represents the martyrdom of Saint \"M\"aze, being dragged to their execution or burial.",
