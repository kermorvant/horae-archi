    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of people gathered indoors, looking towards a divine manifestation. In the foreground, two figures are prominent: one woman with long braided hair, dressed in a long robe, stands with her hands clasped. Beside her, another figure, possibly a man, kneels and gestures towards an open book placed on a small lectern. Behind them, a crowd of individuals, some with halos, are looking upwards. The focal point of the scene is a radiant dove descending from above, emitting rays of light, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The architectural setting appears to be a vaulted interior, suggested by the arched structure above and the presence of windows with tracery. The overall atmosphere is one of reverence and spiritual awe.",
