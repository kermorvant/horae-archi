    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, likely a king or nobleman, kneels in prayer, his hands clasped and his head tilted upwards. He is richly attired in a blue robe with gold trim and a red cloak lined with ermine. Behind him, a patterned tapestry or screen fills the upper portion of the scene, featuring a complex geometric design in blue, red, and gold. Above this, a cherubic figure with wings is depicted. The lower part of the scene shows a green landscape with sparse vegetation. To the right, a crown rests on a cushion, suggesting royalty. To the left, a musical instrument, possibly a harp or lyre, lies on the ground. The overall composition is framed by an arched architectural element, suggestive of a window or portal.",
