    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ in majesty, seated on a golden orb against a starry blue sky. He is shown with a halo, wounds on his chest, and draped in a red cloak over a green garment. His arms are outstretched. Two winged figures, possibly angels, flank him in the upper register. Below, in a green landscape, several figures emerge from the ground, their faces turned upwards towards Christ, with hands raised in supplication. The overall composition suggests a divine and cosmic setting.",
