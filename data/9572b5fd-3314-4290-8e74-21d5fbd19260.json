The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated on a donkey, cradling the Christ Child. She wears a blue mantle adorned with gold trim. Joseph, also with a halo, walks beside the donkey, guiding it and carrying a staff. They are traversing a hilly, green landscape dotted with trees and bushes. In the background, a fortified city with numerous towers and spires is visible on a hill, alongside a windmill. The sky above is a deep blue, with golden rays emanating from the upper center, suggesting divine light.",
