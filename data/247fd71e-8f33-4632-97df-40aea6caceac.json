The people, some with elaborate headdresses, are shown in various poses of reverence and supplication, with some kneeling. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling green hills, scattered trees, and a blue sky. In the background, a small flock of sheep and figures engaged in agricultural work are visible. The entire scene is framed by an arched border adorned with floral motifs and gold leaf.",
