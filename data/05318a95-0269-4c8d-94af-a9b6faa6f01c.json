    "scene_description_enriched": "A young man with reddish-blond hair, dressed in a blue tunic and an orange robe, sits on a grassy slope, holding a scroll and a quill. He appears to be writing or contemplating. To his right, a stylized, reddish-brown bird with a crest and elaborate tail feathers stands on the ground. The background depicts a rolling landscape with green hills, a winding blue river or body of water, and sparse vegetation. The scene is rendered in a typical medieval manuscript style with vibrant colors and a flat perspective.",
