Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a radiant blue background, surrounded by golden rays of light. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by arched openings and columns, suggesting an interior space. The overall composition emphasizes the divine descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles and the Virgin Mary.",
