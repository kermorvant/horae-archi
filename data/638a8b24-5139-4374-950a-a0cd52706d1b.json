    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a flock of sheep grazing on a green hillside. In the foreground, two men are engaged in a struggle. One man, dressed in blue, stands over another man who lies on the ground, seemingly injured or defeated. A dog stands alert beside the standing man. In the upper part of the image, two angels descend from a radiant sky, holding a scroll and bestowing blessings or divine pronouncements. Behind them, a walled city or fortress is visible across a body of water. The overall scene is framed by an ornate border with floral motifs.",
