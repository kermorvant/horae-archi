    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, with her eyes closed and hands crossed over her chest, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies naked in a manger. A cow and a donkey are present, their heads bowed. Behind them, a rustic shelter with a thatched roof is visible, supported by wooden beams. In the background, a rocky landscape unfolds with a winding path, a shepherd with sheep, and two figures, possibly Joseph and another attendant, walking. Above, a winged seraph with multiple eyes and fiery wings, bearing a scroll with the inscription \"Gloria in excelsis Deo,\" flies across a blue sky with stylized clouds.",
