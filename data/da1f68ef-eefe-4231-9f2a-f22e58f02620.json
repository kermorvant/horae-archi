    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man, identified as David, kneeling in a green landscape under a blue, star-filled sky. He wears a red robe lined with ermine and a blue sleeve. His head is tilted upwards, and his hands are raised in supplication. A golden halo surrounds his head, indicating his sanctity. To his right, a harp lies on the ground. In the background, stylized mountains and trees are visible. Above, a radiant red sun with emanating rays dominates the upper portion of the sky, and a green, star-like object descends from it. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
