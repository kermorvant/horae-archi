    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women, likely the Virgin Mary and Saint Elizabeth, in a close embrace, their faces turned towards each other with expressions of deep emotion, possibly sorrow or contemplation. The woman on the left wears a blue mantle over a blue garment, her blonde hair visible. The woman on the right is clad in a white veil and a yellow garment. They are framed within an ornate, decorative border, suggesting a miniature within a manuscript. The background is a simple, light blue.",
