    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition from the Cross. Christ's body, pale and limp, is being carefully lowered from the cross by two figures. One figure, wearing a red tunic and blue head covering, is positioned on a ladder, supporting Christ's torso. Another figure, in a red tunic and green hose, is also actively involved in the descent. Below, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and red undergarment, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, her face turned towards Christ. To her right, another figure, possibly Saint John the Evangelist, stands with his hands clasped, looking towards the scene. The background is a muted, earthy tone, suggesting an outdoor setting, with hints of green suggesting foliage. The entire scene is framed by a decorative gold border.",
