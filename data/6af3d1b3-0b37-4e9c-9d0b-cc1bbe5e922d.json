To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in blue and with hands clasped in prayer, stands beside Saint John the Evangelist, who is also haloed and wears a red and gold robe. To the right, a group of soldiers and onlookers are present. One soldier, clad in armor and a yellow helmet, stands near the cross, while another, wearing a blue robe and a red hat, holds a scroll or document. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible, set against a blue sky with a crescent moon and a star. The foreground features a green, hilly landscape with patches of yellow fields.",
