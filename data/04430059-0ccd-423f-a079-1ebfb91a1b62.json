    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, seated and wearing a crown and bishop's mitre, holds a blue orb in his left hand and gestures with his right. He is draped in a reddish-brown cloak over a white pleated garment. Before him kneels a woman in a blue robe, her hands extended. Behind her, an angel in an orange cloak and green tunic holds a golden crown, offering it towards the woman. The scene takes place indoors, with a stone wall and a diamond-paned window visible on the left, and a green, gold-patterned tapestry on the right. The overall impression is one of a royal or ecclesiastical investiture or a scene of divine revelation.",
