    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with shepherds and their flock. In the foreground, three shepherds are tending to a flock of sheep. One shepherd, wearing a blue hood and yellow tunic, looks upwards, holding a staff. Another shepherd, in a red tunic and grey cloak, plays a horn, accompanied by a dog. A third shepherd, in a yellow tunic and blue sleeves, also looks upwards, holding a staff. In the middle ground, a lone figure sits on a hill, mending footwear, with sheep nearby. In the background, a fortified city with towers and battlements is visible on a hill, and further in the distance, a windmill stands atop another hill. Above the scene, an angel with golden wings and a halo descends from a radiant blue sky, pointing downwards and holding a scroll that reads 'Gloria in excelsis Deo et m'. The overall scene evokes a sense of divine announcement to humble shepherds.",
