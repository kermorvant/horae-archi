    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded figure, likely God the Father, seated on clouds. He is adorned with a circular necklace and wears a draped garment. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or speaking, while his left hand is held near his chest. Two winged figures, presumably angels, are positioned on either side of him, with their hands clasped in prayer or adoration. The background is filled with stylized clouds and what appear to be rays of light emanating from above the central figure. The overall impression is one of divine presence and heavenly activity.",
