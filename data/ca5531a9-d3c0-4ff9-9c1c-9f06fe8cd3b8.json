    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. Christ's body, marked by wounds and wearing a crown of thorns, lies on a bier. The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, mourns beside him, supported by other grieving women. Two figures, possibly Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, are shown preparing to wrap Christ's body in a shroud. The background is a dark, brick-like wall, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a tomb or a preparation area. A crown of thorns lies on the ground in the foreground.",
