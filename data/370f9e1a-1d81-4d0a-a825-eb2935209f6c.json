    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and carrying the cross, being led through a crowd. He is dressed in a blue robe with gold embellishments. Several figures surround him, including a man with a beard helping to carry the cross, and a group of women, one of whom, likely the Virgin Mary, is shown with hands clasped in prayer. Behind Christ, a multitude of soldiers with spears are visible, their weapons forming a dense, upright pattern against the blue sky. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling hills and sparse trees under a bright blue sky with golden clouds. The overall impression is one of suffering and procession.",
