    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with red wings and a golden halo holds a white cloth stained with blood, revealing the head of a man who is also bleeding from his wounds. The angel wears a pink cloak over a blue garment, and the man has long dark hair and a beard. The background is a textured gold pattern on a reddish-orange surface. To the left, architectural elements suggest a Gothic structure with pointed arches and decorative pinnacles. The scene is framed by a green patterned border at the bottom.",
