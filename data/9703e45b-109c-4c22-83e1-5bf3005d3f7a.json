    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a body of water with two large fish swimming in the foreground. In the middle ground, there is a rocky island or peninsula with some rudimentary structures and a single tree. Beyond this, a body of water stretches towards a distant landscape with hills and what appears to be a building or structure on a hill. The overall impression is a natural landscape with aquatic life and a hint of human habitation or fortification.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Fish are often symbolic in Christian art, representing Christ, the Eucharist, or the apostles. Given the context of a Book of Hours, this could be a scene related to a biblical event involving fish, such as the miraculous draught of fishes, or a more general devotional image evoking the bounty of creation or spiritual nourishment.",
