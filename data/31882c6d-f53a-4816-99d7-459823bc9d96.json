    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men gathered under an architectural canopy, possibly a loggia or a decorative archway. On the left, a woman stands, facing the group. The central figures are engaged in conversation, with one man, seated and wearing a patterned robe, appearing to address the others. To the right, another man, possibly a cleric or a figure of authority, is depicted. The architectural elements suggest a formal setting, possibly within a courtyard or a public space. The overall composition is framed by decorative architectural motifs.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a council or a meeting of important figures, possibly from a biblical narrative or a historical event.
