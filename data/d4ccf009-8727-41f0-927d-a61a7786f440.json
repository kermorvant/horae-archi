    "scene_description_enriched": "Within an arched frame adorned with foliate motifs, a haloed male figure, identified as Saint Mark, is depicted seated on an ornate throne, diligently writing on a scroll. He wears a blue tunic and a pink mantle. To his left, a winged lion, the symbol of Saint Mark, stands on a patterned floor, also associated with the saint, and appears to be looking at the writing. Behind the figure, a richly decorated tapestry hangs, and to the left, an open doorway reveals an architectural setting with arched windows and a path leading outdoors into a landscape. The scene combines an interior setting with a view of the exterior.",
