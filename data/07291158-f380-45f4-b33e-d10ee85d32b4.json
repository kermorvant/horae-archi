    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Daniel in the lions' den, a biblical narrative. Daniel, a young man with curly hair, is seated with his hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards with a pensive expression. He is surrounded by several lions, some lying down and others standing, all appearing calm and submissive. Above Daniel, a figure, likely an angel, descends from the clouds, holding a vessel. In the background, elaborate classical architecture is visible, including arches, columns, and a domed structure, suggesting an outdoor setting within a grand courtyard or palace complex. The overall composition emphasizes Daniel's faith and divine protection.",
