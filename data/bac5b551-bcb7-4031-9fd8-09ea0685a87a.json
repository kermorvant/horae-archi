    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child, who also has a halo. Joseph, with a fur-lined hat and a red cloak, leads the donkey. The background features a landscape with rolling hills, a body of water, and in the distance, a city with prominent spires and domes, suggesting a destination or origin. The scene is framed by an ornate, decorative border typical of Books of Hours.",
