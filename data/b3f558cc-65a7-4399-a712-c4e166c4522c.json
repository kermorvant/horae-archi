    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a prophet or saint, kneels in prayer on a patterned rug, facing a large, imposing castle. The castle features multiple towers with crenellations and small windows, and a section with arched openings. Above the castle, a golden, swirling pattern against a blue sky is visible. In the upper left corner, a haloed figure in pink robes is depicted in a circular medallion, also in prayer. The scene appears to be a vision or a moment of divine communication, possibly related to the Old Testament.",
