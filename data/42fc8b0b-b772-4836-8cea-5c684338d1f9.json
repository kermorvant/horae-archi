    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious service taking place within a richly decorated church interior. Several figures are engaged in prayer and reading. On the left, a group of three individuals, two men and a woman, are gathered around a lectern, reading from an open book. One of the men wears a red cap, and the woman is dressed in a blue patterned robe. To the right, a priest, adorned in a blue cope with gold stars, stands before an altar, his hands clasped in prayer as he reads from a book. Two figures in black monastic habits kneel before the altar, one with head bowed. A woman in a white wimple and black habit also stands in prayer. The architecture features a vaulted ceiling painted with blue and gold stars, supported by columns. Windows with tracery are visible, and an organ is depicted in the background. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. The overall atmosphere is one of solemn devotion.",
