    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male figure, identified as Saint Andrew by his attribute, the saltire cross, is depicted holding the cross diagonally across his body. He wears a blue tunic with a patterned overlay and a red cloak. His hair is brown and wavy, and he has a halo indicating sainthood. The background features a bright blue sky with some clouds, a green, rolling landscape with trees, and in the distance, a cluster of buildings with red roofs and a spire, suggesting a town or village. The scene is rendered in a typical medieval manuscript illumination style.",
