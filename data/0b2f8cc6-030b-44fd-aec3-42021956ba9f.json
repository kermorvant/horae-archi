    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by several figures. Christ, wearing a purple robe and a crown of thorns, is shown kneeling and struggling under the weight of a large wooden cross. He is being pushed and pulled by several men. To his left, a woman in a blue mantle, likely the Virgin Mary, looks on with sorrow, her hands clasped. Behind her, other figures with halos suggest disciples or mourners. The setting is outdoors, indicated by the ground and the light blue sky. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with halos signifying their spiritual importance.",
