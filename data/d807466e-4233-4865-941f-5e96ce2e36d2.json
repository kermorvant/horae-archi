    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a woman, with long, flowing hair, looking upwards and gesturing with one hand. She is seated or kneeling, with a bird perched on her left arm. In the foreground, another figure, possibly an animal or a person in a crouched position, is visible. The background features stylized foliage and what appears to be a draped canopy or architectural element. The overall impression is one of a pastoral or devotional setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of a bird and a figure in a contemplative pose, possibly receiving a divine message or in prayer, suggests a scene related to a saint or a biblical narrative. Without further context or clearer iconography, a definitive interpretation is difficult, but it could allude to a moment of divine inspiration or a specific hagiographic event.",
