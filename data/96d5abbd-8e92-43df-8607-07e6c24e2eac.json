On the left, a figure in clerical vestments, likely a priest, stands with hands clasped in prayer before an altar. The altar is adorned with a chalice and a decorative panel. In the background, to the right, three figures are gathered around a lectern, attentively reading from an open book. A fourth figure, cloaked in dark fabric, stands to the far right, partially obscured. The architecture features an arched opening with decorative elements and a window with visible mullions. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern, and decorative fabric with fleur-de-lis motifs covers the ground in front of the altar and lectern. Two candlesticks with lit candles are placed on the floor.",
