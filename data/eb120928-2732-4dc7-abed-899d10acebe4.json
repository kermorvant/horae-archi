    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female saint, identified by the palm frond and sword, stands in a landscape. She wears a white tunic adorned with small dark marks and a rich red cloak lined with gold fabric. A golden halo surrounds her head, and a jeweled crown sits upon her blonde hair. In her right hand, she holds a golden sword with a decorative hilt, and her left hand rests on her cloak. The background depicts a verdant, rolling landscape with stylized trees and distant architectural structures, including towers and what appear to be fortified buildings. The overall scene evokes a sense of solemnity and devotion, typical of depictions of female martyrs.",
