In the background, an angel expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, with other naked figures, possibly representing humanity after the Fall, in a landscape with trees bearing fruit. The scene is framed by ornate architectural elements, including columns and decorative borders, and a coat of arms supported by griffins at the bottom.",
