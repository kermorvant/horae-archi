    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a dramatic interior setting, likely a palace or hall, with tiled flooring and arched architectural elements. On the left, a regal figure, presumably King Herod, sits on a throne, adorned with a crown and a fur-trimmed blue mantle. He gestures with his hand. Facing him, a woman in a red robe stands, holding a staff. In the center, a soldier in red armor and a helmet raises a sword over a naked infant. A woman in a blue robe and white head covering kneels before the infant, reaching out in distress. To the right, a woman in a blue robe and a yellow headdress holds another infant, looking on with concern. The scene is framed by decorative borders typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
