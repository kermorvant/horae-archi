    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a beard, wearing a golden robe, stands with his hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. He is in a rocky, natural landscape with trees and a body of water. In the background, a formidable castle sits atop a hill. To the right of the man, a multi-headed serpent-like creature emerges from the rocks. The scene is framed by an ornate, gold-colored arch, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript. This scene likely depicts a moment of spiritual trial or divine intervention, possibly related to the man's faith or a biblical narrative involving a struggle against evil.",
