    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching out. They are facing a priest, likely Simeon, who is wearing a bishop's mitre and vestments and is about to receive the child. To the left, a woman in a green dress carries a basket containing doves, and behind her stands a bearded man. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that includes a checkered floor, a raised platform with steps, and an altar-like structure with a golden tabernacle. The background is a rich red tapestry with gold ornamentation. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
