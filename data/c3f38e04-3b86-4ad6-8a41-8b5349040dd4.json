The Holy Spirit is represented by a dove descending upon Christ's head. Christ is shown with wounds from the crucifixion, wearing a loincloth. Behind the figures, a golden, patterned background suggests a divine or heavenly setting, framed by red drapery with figures of angels or saints visible within. The ground beneath is rendered with a checkered pattern.",
