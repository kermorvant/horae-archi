    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely Christ or a saint, is seated on a raised wooden throne, holding an open book and gesturing with one hand. The figure wears a blue robe. Around the throne, several individuals are gathered, some seated and others standing. To the left, a figure in a red robe and white wimple is seated, with hands clasped. Behind them, two men are visible, one in a red cap and green tunic, the other in a grey cap. To the right, a man in a blue robe and a fur-trimmed crown is seated. The scene takes place indoors, with a checkered floor and a backdrop featuring a window with tracery. The overall setting suggests a teaching or discourse.",
