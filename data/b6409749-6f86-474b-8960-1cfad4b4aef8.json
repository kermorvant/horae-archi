    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a simple wooden structure, suggesting a stable. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child on her lap. Three Magi are present: one kneels before them, offering a chalice; another stands behind him, holding a reliquary; and the third stands to the right, also holding a vessel. The background shows rolling green hills under a pale sky. The architectural elements are rudimentary, consisting of wooden beams and a thatched roof.",
