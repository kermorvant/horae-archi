    "scene_description_enriched": "This image depicts a decorative border featuring stylized floral elements and a creature that appears to be a lion or a similar beast of prey. The creature is shown in profile, with its head turned towards the right, revealing sharp teeth and a textured mane. Its body is rendered with hatching to suggest fur. The floral motifs include blossoms with multiple petals and swirling foliate designs. The entire composition is framed by a double horizontal line, suggesting it is a decorative element within a larger work, likely a manuscript. Below the border, partial text is visible, indicating it is part of a book.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of a lion motif in medieval art often carries symbolic meaning, representing strength, royalty, or even Christ. The floral elements can symbolize purity, the Virgin Mary, or the Garden of Eden. Without further context from the manuscript, a definitive interpretation is difficult, but it likely serves as a decorative or symbolic embellishment.",
