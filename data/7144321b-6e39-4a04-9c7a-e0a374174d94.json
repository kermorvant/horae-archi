    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned man, identified as King David, kneels in prayer within an arched architectural setting. He wears a blue robe adorned with golden fleur-de-lis and a richly patterned surcoat. His hands are clasped in supplication, and his gaze is directed upwards. To his right, a harp rests on a stand. Through a large window, a verdant landscape is visible, featuring rolling hills, trees, and a distant castle or fortified building. Above the landscape, an angel with outstretched wings hovers in a blue sky. The scene likely depicts King David in prayer, possibly receiving divine inspiration or a message from an angel, a common theme in devotional art.",
