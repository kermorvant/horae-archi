    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a man and a woman, both wearing crowns and elaborate ruffs. The man, positioned on the left, has his hands clasped in prayer. He is adorned with a fur-lined mantle over a patterned robe, and a crown with fleur-de-lis motifs. The woman, to the right, also wears a crown and a richly decorated garment with a jeweled pendant. The background is dark and featureless, with a decorative border at the top containing small sculpted faces. The scene is a formal portrait, likely intended to convey royal status and piety.",
