    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a saint, kneels with his arms outstretched and head tilted upwards, gazing towards the sky. He wears a simple, earth-toned robe with a fur collar. In the background, a fortified castle with towers and crenellations sits atop a green, rolling hill. To the right, a winged angelic figure, possibly an angel, hovers in the sky, holding a palm frond or branch. The scene is set outdoors with a blue sky above.",
