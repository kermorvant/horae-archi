    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, rides a grey donkey, holding the Christ Child swaddled in white. She wears a blue mantle over a golden-orange tunic. To her right, a bearded man, presumably Saint Joseph, walks alongside, dressed in a red robe with gold trim and a blue tunic, leaning on a staff. The scene unfolds in a landscape with rolling green hills, a body of water, and distant blue castles or towers on a hill. The foreground is a sandy path, and the background is a bright blue sky. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
