    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a Nativity, with the Virgin Mary lying in a bed covered by a large orange blanket, resting her head on a pillow. Behind her, within a simple wooden stable structure, are a cow and a donkey, their heads visible. To the right of the bed, an elderly man, likely Joseph, is seated, leaning on a staff and appearing to be asleep or weary. The setting is humble, suggesting the traditional depiction of the birth of Christ in a stable.",
