    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border with stylized vegetal motifs and what appear to be human faces or figures integrated into the design. The central portion of the border shows a figure with a beard and long hair, possibly a prophet or saint, depicted in profile. Below this, another figure's head is visible, also in profile, with a serene expression. The overall impression is one of intricate, possibly symbolic, ornamentation rather than a narrative scene. The context is likely devotional, given the typical use of such borders in Books of Hours.",
