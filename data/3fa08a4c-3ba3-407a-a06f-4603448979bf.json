    "scene_description_enriched": "In a verdant landscape, a knight in full armor is depicted raising a sword, poised to strike a lamb held by a woman in a blue gown. Below them, a dismembered infant lies on the ground, with another infant's head nearby. To the right, a king, seated on a stepped platform and wearing a crown, holds a sword. In the background, a windmill stands on a hill, and distant buildings with spires suggest a town. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements. This imagery likely represents the Judgment of Solomon, where the king's wisdom is tested by a dispute over a child.",
