    "scene_description_enriched": "A young couple, a man and a woman, are seated outdoors in a grassy landscape with trees and a flock of sheep in the background. The woman, dressed in a red gown and white head covering, holds a lamb in her lap and appears to be tending to it. The man, in a blue tunic and dark cap, has his arm around her and gently touches her chin. The scene evokes a pastoral setting, possibly representing a moment of tenderness and care within a rural context.",
