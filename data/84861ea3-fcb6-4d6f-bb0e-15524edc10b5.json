    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and cope, stands holding a cross-staff in his left hand and a blue-bound book in his right. He wears a white mitre adorned with gold embroidery, a crimson cope over a grey alb, and a pectoral cross. A halo encircles his head, indicating his sanctity. The background is a dark, textured void, suggesting a spiritual or devotional context rather than a specific physical location. The figure is depicted in a devotional pose, reading from the open book.",
