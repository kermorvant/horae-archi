    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint or scholar, is seated at a wooden lectern, diligently writing in a large illuminated manuscript. The figure wears a blue robe over a golden garment and a black cap. To the right, a lion with a halo sits attentively, its tongue extended. The scene is set within an architectural space featuring a vaulted ceiling with red and orange hues, large windows with tracery, and decorative patterned walls. A circular table with books, an inkwell, and a quill is also visible. The overall impression is one of scholarly pursuit and divine inspiration, possibly depicting a saint known for their writings or theological work, with the lion symbolizing strength, courage, or perhaps a specific attribute of the saint.",
