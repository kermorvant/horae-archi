    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint, stands in a green, grassy landscape under a blue sky. She has long, blonde hair and wears a blue robe and a reddish-pink cloak lined with gold. In her left hand, she holds an open book, and in her right, she grasps a pair of tongs. A halo encircles her head, indicating her sanctity. The scene is rendered with a stylized, somewhat naive artistic approach typical of some medieval manuscript illuminations.",
