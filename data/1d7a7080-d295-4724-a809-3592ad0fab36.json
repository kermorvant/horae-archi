    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling in prayer outdoors, with a castle and a body of water in the background. Above him, a dove descends, radiating light, and in the upper right corner, a bearded figure, presumably God the Father, is depicted within a blue celestial sphere, also radiating light and pointing. A scroll unfurls above the kneeling man, bearing an inscription. The landscape is rendered with rolling hills and scattered trees. The man is richly dressed in a long robe with blue and gold trim, and wears a distinctive golden headdress. The castle features multiple towers with conical roofs topped by crosses, and a large arched entrance. The overall composition suggests a divine revelation or inspiration.",
