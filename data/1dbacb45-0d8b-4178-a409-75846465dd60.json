    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bathing ritual or a symbolic cleansing. On the left, a robed figure, possibly a queen or noblewoman, sits and offers a bowl of fruit to a nude woman emerging from a body of water. The nude woman has long hair and is adorned with a necklace. Behind them, architectural elements suggest a grand setting, with arches, columns, and ornate structures. To the right, a group of armed men are depicted in a battle or procession, suggesting a narrative context beyond the immediate interaction. The overall composition is framed by decorative architectural borders.",
