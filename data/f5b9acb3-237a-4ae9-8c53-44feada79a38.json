    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of five women, four of whom are standing and one is partially obscured. The two women on the left and the woman on the far right are dressed in elaborate gowns and wear jeweled crowns. The central two women are engaged in an interaction, with one holding a scroll or banner inscribed with letters, possibly \"I\" and \"&\" and \"P\". Above them, within a circular frame, two figures, likely divine or saintly, are depicted. The background is a textured, wavy pattern, suggesting water or a turbulent sky. The overall impression is one of a devotional or allegorical scene, possibly related to a biblical narrative or a saint's life, with an emphasis on female piety and divine intervention.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene appears to represent a devotional or allegorical moment, possibly related to the Virgin Mary or a female saint, given the presence of multiple women and the divine figures above. The scroll with letters might allude to a specific prayer, scripture, or a significant event. The crowns suggest royalty or high status, perhaps indicating the women are queens, noblewomen, or even personifications of virtues.",
