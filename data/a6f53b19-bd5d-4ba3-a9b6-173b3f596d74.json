She is draped in voluminous clothing. In the background, a smaller figure stands, facing away from the viewer, dressed in a tunic and cap. Behind this figure, a stylized cityscape is visible, featuring a tall tower with crenellations and arched windows, alongside other buildings. The overall scene suggests an outdoor setting with architectural elements.",

The gesture of the woman's hands and her prominent headdress could indicate a moment of prophecy, prayer, or discourse.
