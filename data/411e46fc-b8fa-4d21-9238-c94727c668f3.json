She is attended by several women. One woman, in a purple robe, leans over Mary, holding a white cloth and a bowl. Another woman, in a blue robe, stands to the right, gesturing with her hand. Two other women are visible behind a table laden with bowls and a pitcher. In the foreground, a cradle contains the infant Virgin Mary, also with a halo. The background features stylized architecture with arched windows and decorative patterns, suggesting an interior setting within a building.",
