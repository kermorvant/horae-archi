    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, depicted in profile, wears a distinctive headdress with a circular ornament and a flowing garment adorned with buttons. He is framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior or a niche. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong lines and stippling for shading. The figure's solemn expression and regal attire suggest he might represent a king or a prophet from the Old Testament, possibly depicted in a devotional context within a Book of Hours.",
