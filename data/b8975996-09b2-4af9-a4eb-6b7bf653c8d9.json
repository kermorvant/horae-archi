    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross, haloed and with a scroll above him reading \"con[f]f[o]m marum eff\". Angels, some in yellow and red robes, attend to him, with one in a brown robe kneeling below. To the left, a figure identified as \"David\" stands in a richly decorated blue and gold robe and a turban-like headdress, with his hand to his face in contemplation. A harp is placed at his feet. The setting is an outdoor landscape with stylized green trees and a pale blue sky. In the foreground, various animals are depicted, including a lion, a horse-like creature, a rooster, and birds. The overall scene combines the sacred event of the Crucifixion with the figure of King David, suggesting a devotional context that links the Old Testament king to the New Testament sacrifice.",
