    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, shown as the Man of Sorrows, seated and displaying his wounds, with an angel hovering behind him, placing a hand on his shoulder. Christ is depicted with a halo, long hair, and a beard, wearing only a loincloth. The angel also has a halo and large wings. They are positioned within a space that suggests a tomb or sarcophagus, indicated by the stone slab and the decorative architectural elements below. The background is filled with a starry or speckled pattern, suggesting a celestial or otherworldly setting. The overall composition evokes the sorrow and sacrifice of Christ's Passion and Resurrection.",
