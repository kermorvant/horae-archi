    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an angel, identifiable by its halo and wings, in a red tunic and white undergarment, holding a sword aloft. The angel is confronting a small, demonic creature with yellow skin and large eyes, which is partially obscured by the angel's leg and appears to be recoiling or being subdued. The background is a vibrant blue sky above a green, grassy landscape with stylized vegetation. The entire image is framed by an arched border with decorative elements. This scene likely represents the triumph of good over evil, possibly the Archangel Michael battling a demon.",
