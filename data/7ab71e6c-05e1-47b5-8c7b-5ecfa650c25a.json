    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a stylized representation of a heart, rendered in shades of orange and brown, set against a vibrant blue background. The heart is centrally placed and appears textured, with visible hatching lines suggesting depth. Four circular elements, also in orange and brown, are positioned around the heart, two above and two below, at the cardinal points of a compass. The blue background is adorned with delicate, swirling gold lines that create a sense of movement or texture. The overall composition is abstract and symbolic, lacking any discernible figures, architecture, or setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The heart is a potent symbol in devotional art, often representing divine love, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, or the human heart's devotion to God. The surrounding circular elements could symbolize the four evangelists, the four cardinal virtues, or perhaps even wounds. The abstract nature of the depiction suggests a focus on spiritual or emotional concepts rather than a narrative scene.",
