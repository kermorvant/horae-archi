    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Archangel Michael, clad in golden armor and a royal mantle, standing triumphantly over a defeated dragon. He holds a sword raised in his right hand, poised to strike, and a shield emblazoned with a circular emblem in his left. His wings are spread wide, and a halo encircles his head. The background features a pastoral landscape with distant architectural structures, including towers and what appear to be fortified buildings, suggesting a terrestrial setting. The dragon, depicted as a monstrous, scaly creature with horns and claws, lies beneath Michael's feet, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.",
