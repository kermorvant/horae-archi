    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel, identified by his halo and wings, standing over a dragon-like creature. He is clad in a blue robe and red tunic, and holds a spear aloft, poised to strike the beast. The background is a rich, patterned tapestry of red and gold, with a small green tree on the left. The dragon is depicted with a scaly body, a coiled tail, and sharp teeth. The overall composition suggests a moment of triumph over evil.",
