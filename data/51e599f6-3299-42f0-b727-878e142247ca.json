    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, wavy hair and a distinctive headdress stands in profile, looking to the right. She wears a long garment with a draped skirt. To her right, a tall, slender architectural element, possibly a column or a part of a larger structure, is depicted. Above the woman's head, an arched decorative element, possibly part of a canopy or architectural framing, is visible. The scene is rendered in a black and white, etched style, suggesting a manuscript illumination or woodcut.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image does not contain enough iconographic detail to definitively interpret a specific religious, biblical, liturgical, or devotional meaning. It appears to be a portrait or a figure within a larger narrative context that is not fully presented.",
