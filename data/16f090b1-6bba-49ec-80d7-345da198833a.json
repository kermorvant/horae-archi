    "scene_description_enriched": "This image displays a decorative border with stylized foliate motifs and two animalistic figures. On the left, a creature resembling a lion or monkey is depicted in profile, facing right, with its mouth open. On the right, another creature, also animalistic, is shown in profile, facing left, with its mouth open. Between these figures, a central floral element is rendered with layered petals, surrounded by swirling vines and smaller decorative elements. The overall style is that of a woodcut or wood engraving, characterized by bold black lines on a light background. There is no discernible religious or biblical scene depicted; this appears to be purely ornamental.",
