    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist seated in a verdant, somewhat enclosed landscape, possibly a grotto or a natural hollow. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a rose-colored cloak, with a golden halo around his head, indicating his saintly status. He holds a scroll or parchment in his left hand and a quill pen in his right, poised as if to write. To his left, a golden eagle, his traditional symbol, is depicted with its wings spread, looking towards the saint. The background features rolling hills under a starry blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall composition evokes a moment of divine inspiration or contemplation for the evangelist.",
