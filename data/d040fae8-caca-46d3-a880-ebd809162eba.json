    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, dressed in a dark gown and veil, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before an open book placed on a green-covered table. The book displays musical notation. Behind her, a bed with red drapery and a dark, possibly wooden, structure is visible. The background appears to be a brick wall. The scene is framed by decorative architectural elements on the left and right, featuring gold leaf and blue panels with stylized motifs. The overall setting suggests a private devotional space within a domestic or monastic context.",
