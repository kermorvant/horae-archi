    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling in prayer outdoors, with his hands clasped and raised. He is dressed in a rich red robe with gold embellishments and a blue undergarment. Beside him lies a golden harp and a basket containing a pomegranate. In the background, a walled city with numerous towers, spires, and buildings is visible, nestled within rolling green hills. Above the city, in a celestial cartouche, a bearded figure in pink robes holds a cross and appears to be reading or contemplating. The overall impression is one of devotion and contemplation set against a detailed urban and natural landscape.",
