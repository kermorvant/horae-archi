    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a circular frame. On the left, a younger figure with a beard and short hair, wearing a tunic, raises their hands in a gesture of supplication or awe. To the right, a more mature figure with a long beard and flowing hair, also with hands raised, appears to be speaking or gesturing. Behind the younger figure is a stylized tree with branches reaching upwards. The background is filled with stippling, suggesting a celestial or ethereal setting. The overall composition evokes a moment of divine encounter or revelation.",
