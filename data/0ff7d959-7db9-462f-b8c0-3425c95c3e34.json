He is dressed in dark robes and holds a book in his left arm and what appears to be a scroll or tablet in his right hand. The figure is positioned in a doorway or opening, with a checkered floor extending into the foreground. To the left, an arched opening reveals a landscape with stylized trees. To the right, a window with tracery is visible, suggesting an interior space. The overall scene evokes a sense of contemplation or scholarly pursuit.",
