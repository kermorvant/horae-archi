    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint Luke by the presence of the ox symbol, is depicted seated and writing in an open book. He wears a green robe and a turban, and has a halo, indicating his saintly status. He holds a quill in his right hand and an inkwell in his left, actively engaged in transcription. Before him lies an open book on his lap, and to his right, a lectern holds another book. The background suggests an interior space with draped fabric and a window revealing a distant landscape with a castle. To the right of the scene, the head and forelegs of an ox are visible, a traditional symbol of Saint Luke.",
