    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with green wings, wearing an orange tunic, descends from a rocky, mountainous landscape. The angel holds a scroll inscribed with Latin text, which appears to be a divine message. Below, in a pastoral setting with scattered trees and a green fence, a young shepherd in a blue cloak and red tunic looks up at the angel, holding a staff. To the right, an older man, also in blue attire and a pink hat, sits on a red stool, gesturing with his hands. Several sheep are scattered around the scene, some lying down and others standing. The background features rolling hills and stylized trees, with a decorative border framing the entire composition.",
