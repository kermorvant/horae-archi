    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, is seated on a gilded throne, dressed in a flowing grey robe. He holds an open book in his lap, writing with a quill, and gestures with his other hand. To his left, a lectern holds another open book, and a small cabinet displays a closed book. A bird, possibly an eagle, is depicted on the green tiled floor in the foreground. The scene is framed by architectural elements, including columns and arches, and a window reveals a landscape with rolling hills and buildings. The overall impression is one of scholarly contemplation and divine inspiration.",
