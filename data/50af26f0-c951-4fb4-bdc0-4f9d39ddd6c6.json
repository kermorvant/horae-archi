    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her halo, standing on a set of stairs leading to a building entrance. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a white garment and holds a small object in her hand. Facing her, and slightly lower on the stairs, is Saint Elizabeth, dressed in a purple gown and a white veil, gesturing towards Mary. Behind Mary, within the doorway of the building, a nun or servant is visible, looking out and holding a rope, possibly indicating she is ringing a bell or operating a mechanism. The architecture features a gabled roof, a pointed archway with decorative tracery, and columns. The setting appears to be an exterior with some architectural elements suggesting a dwelling or religious building.",
