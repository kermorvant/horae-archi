    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and vestments, stands behind a wooden lectern, gesturing with his hands as if preaching or giving counsel. In front of him, two women are seated on the floor, one in a pink gown and the other in a lavender gown. Behind them, a group of men are gathered, some looking towards the bishop and others conversing amongst themselves. The scene takes place within an interior space with arched architectural elements and a window with tracery. The bishop's gesture and the presence of the seated women suggest a scene of instruction or spiritual guidance, possibly related to a religious teaching or a confession.",
