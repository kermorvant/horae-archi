    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures moves across a green, grassy ground. In the foreground, a woman in a pink gown, her head tilted back and eyes closed, appears to be fainting or in distress. She is supported by a man in a blue robe with gold trim, who holds her arm. Behind them, another man in a blue robe with gold trim, and an older man with a white beard also in blue, walk forward. To the far right, a man in a red robe with gold trim follows. On the left, a figure in a blue robe, possibly a servant or attendant, is pulling the pink-gowned woman forward. The background is a richly patterned tapestry or wall, composed of small, tessellated squares of red, blue, and gold.",
