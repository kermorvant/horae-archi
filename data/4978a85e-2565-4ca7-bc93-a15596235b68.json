    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary on the left, dressed in a blue mantle and gold-embroidered dress, her hands clasped in prayer. Before her is a lectern with an open book. To her right stands the Archangel Gabriel, with large red wings, wearing a gold tunic and green undergarment, holding a golden lily and gesturing towards Mary. Rays of light emanate from Gabriel towards Mary, symbolizing the divine conception. Above and to the right, a depiction of God the Father, robed and bearded, blesses the scene, with a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descending towards Mary. The setting appears to be a room with architectural elements suggesting an interior, including a column and a draped curtain, with a glimpse of a landscape through a window.",
