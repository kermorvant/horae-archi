    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, naked and with a halo, is bound to a thick, green column. His body is marked with numerous wounds, some of which are bleeding. Two figures, presumably tormentors, are shown inflicting pain. The figure on the left, wearing a blue tunic and a red cap, holds a whip and strikes Christ's face. The figure on the right, dressed in a green tunic and a white cap, raises a rod with two red spheres, poised to strike. The background is a rich green tapestry with gold ornamentation, suggesting a formal or symbolic setting. The floor is a checkered pattern of dark green and light gold squares, creating a sense of depth.",
