    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal figure, likely a king, seated on a throne and holding a sword. He is dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold trim and wears a crown. Before him, an older man in a golden robe presents a sword, possibly as an offering or a symbol of authority. Behind the older man, a figure with a halo, presumably Christ, stands with his hand raised in a gesture of blessing or guidance. Several other figures, dressed in blue and golden robes, kneel and look up at the scene with supplication. The background features a richly patterned tapestry and a red curtain behind the throne, suggesting an indoor, possibly courtly, setting. The overall composition conveys a sense of investiture or a significant presentation of power.",
