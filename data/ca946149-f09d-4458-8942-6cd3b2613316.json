    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a group of four men, each wearing distinct headwear and elaborately patterned robes. Their hands are clasped or held in gestures of prayer or supplication. The figures are rendered in a stylized, woodcut-like manner, with strong outlines and hatched shading. The background is filled with decorative motifs, suggesting a rich textile or tapestry, rather than a specific architectural setting. The overall impression is one of solemnity and devotion, possibly representing a group of donors or figures engaged in prayer.",
