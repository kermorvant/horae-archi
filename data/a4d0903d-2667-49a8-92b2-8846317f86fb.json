    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe adorned with gold trim, meeting Elizabeth, who wears a red cloak over a blue garment and a white veil. They are shown holding hands, suggesting a moment of greeting and recognition. Behind them, a rocky landscape with green foliage rises on the left, while on the right, a building with a golden, steeply pitched roof and grey stone walls is visible. The sky is a deep blue, dotted with stars, and rays of golden light emanate from the upper center, possibly symbolizing divine presence or blessing. The figures are haloed, indicating their sanctity.",
