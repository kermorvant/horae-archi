    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in a landscape setting. He is richly robed in a crimson mantle lined with gold and a blue tunic adorned with gold stars. His hands are raised in blessing or prayer. To his left, three nude children are depicted. One child sits on a barrel-like object, while the other two stand behind, looking towards the bishop. The background is a stylized depiction of trees and foliage, rendered in muted greens and blues. The overall scene suggests a moment of pastoral care or divine intervention.",
