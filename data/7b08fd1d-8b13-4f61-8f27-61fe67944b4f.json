    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, is depicted in a richly ornamented ecclesiastical robe. He wears a white mitre adorned with gold and jewels, and a golden halo encircles his head, signifying sainthood. His right hand, gloved in white, is raised in a gesture of blessing or teaching, with fingers delicately extended. His left hand grasps a golden crozier, topped with a cross. The background suggests an interior architectural setting, with a dark, textured wall and a hint of a patterned screen or lattice behind him. The overall impression is one of solemnity and spiritual authority.",
