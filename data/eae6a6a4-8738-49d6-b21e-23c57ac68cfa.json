    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession of figures in a city setting, with elaborate Gothic architecture forming the backdrop. On the left, a crowd of people, some appearing distressed, are gathered near an arched gateway. In the center, a group of individuals in red robes and white habits, possibly clergy or mourners, are shown with hands clasped in prayer. To the right, a procession carries a reliquary or shrine, accompanied by figures in religious attire. Above the city, an angel with a halo and wings stands on a tower, holding a sword and a trumpet. The overall impression is one of solemnity and religious devotion, possibly depicting a funeral procession, a saint's procession, or a scene related to the Last Judgment given the presence of the angel.",
