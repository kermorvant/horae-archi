    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, is seated and holding the Christ Child, who is naked and appears to be reaching out. Behind them is a brick wall and a wooden structure, possibly a stable or shelter, with a golden sunburst above. Three Magi, identified by their crowns, approach the Virgin and Child. One kneels, offering a golden vessel, while the other two stand, one holding a similar vessel and the other a box. The figures are rendered with simple, stylized features, and the background is a mix of architectural elements and a sky with a sunburst.",
