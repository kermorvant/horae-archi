    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, kneels before a lectern, her hands resting on an open book. Above her, an angel, identified as Gabriel, descends, holding a scroll with text. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is shown between them, emanating rays of light. In the background, architectural elements suggest a room with windows and a draped canopy over a bed. A small table with a vase of flowers stands to the right. The scene is framed by an illuminated border.",
