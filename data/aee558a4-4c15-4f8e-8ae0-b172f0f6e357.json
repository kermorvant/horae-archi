    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel, identified by a golden halo and large, red-feathered wings, stands over a dark-skinned, demonic figure that lies prostrate on the ground. The angel is clad in a white robe and holds a sword aloft, its tip adorned with a cross, which is poised to strike the demon. The angel also holds a red scroll inscribed with a complex, cross-like symbol. The background depicts a stylized landscape with rolling green hills, a body of water, and a distant castle with multiple towers. The sky is a deep blue, dotted with gold stars. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
