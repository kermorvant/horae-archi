    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, some with beards and wearing robes and headdresses, are depicted on the left, with hands clasped in prayer or supplication. On the right, a multi-headed beast, resembling a dragon or hydra with several serpentine necks and heads, is shown. One of the heads appears to be a human face. The figures on the left seem to be reacting to or confronting the beast. The setting is indistinct, suggesting an outdoor or possibly a symbolic space, with no clear architectural structures visible.",
