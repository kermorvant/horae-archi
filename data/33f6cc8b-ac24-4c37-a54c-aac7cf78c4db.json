    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman in a long red robe and blue underdress, with a white veil, stands on the left, holding a small object and gesturing towards a man. The man, with a beard and appearing disheveled, is kneeling on a mound of straw or hay, his hands clasped in prayer. He is wearing a white loincloth. Behind them, a stone building with towers and windows is visible, suggesting a castle or fortified structure. The scene is set outdoors with a hilly landscape and trees in the background under a blue sky with scattered gold stars.",
