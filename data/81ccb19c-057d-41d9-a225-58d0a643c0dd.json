    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identified by his halo and gesture, addressing a group of onlookers. To his left, the Virgin Mary, also haloed, stands with hands clasped in prayer, accompanied by other figures. In the foreground, a man, possibly Lazarus, is shown emerging from a tomb, supported by another figure. The setting appears to be an interior space with architectural elements such as columns and a window with tracery. The overall scene likely represents a miracle of resurrection or healing, possibly the Raising of Lazarus.",
