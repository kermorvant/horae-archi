    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a preacher or prophet, stands at a gilded lectern adorned with red fabric patterned with gold rosettes, addressing a large congregation. He wears a blue tunic and a golden cloak, and holds a book. The congregation, composed of men and women, is seated on benches and appears to be listening attentively. The scene is set within a grand architectural space characterized by towering columns and arches, suggesting a church or a similar religious building. The overall impression is one of a sermon or a religious teaching taking place.",
