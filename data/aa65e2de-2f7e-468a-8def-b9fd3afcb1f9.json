    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, kneeling in the foreground with her hands clasped in prayer, gazes towards the infant Christ. The Christ Child lies on a white cloth-covered table, presented by a figure in bishop's attire, likely Simeon. Behind the Virgin, a woman in a red and gold dress holds a censer containing two doves, symbolizing the offering prescribed by Mosaic Law. Other figures, including men with beards and hats, stand in the background, some with hands raised in gestures of awe or prayer. The architectural setting is suggested by columns and an arched opening, with a glimpse of a landscape and city domes in the distance. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
