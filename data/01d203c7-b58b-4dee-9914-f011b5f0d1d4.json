    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, wearing a conical hat with a circular emblem, is depicted in a seated or kneeling posture. He is dressed in a robe and a mantle. His right hand is raised, with two fingers extended, as if in blessing or teaching. He holds a book or scroll in his left hand. Behind him, architectural elements suggest an interior setting, with what appears to be a column and decorative stonework. The overall style is that of a medieval manuscript illumination.",
