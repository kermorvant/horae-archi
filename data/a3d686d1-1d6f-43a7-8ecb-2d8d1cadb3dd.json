    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, kneels on a rocky, undulating landscape. The figure wears a grey robe with white and yellow trim and holds a rosary in their right hand, while their left hand rests on a circular object with decorative elements. To the left, a golden chalice is depicted. The background features stylized trees and rolling hills under a blue sky. The overall scene suggests a moment of contemplation or prayer in a natural, albeit somewhat abstract, setting.",
