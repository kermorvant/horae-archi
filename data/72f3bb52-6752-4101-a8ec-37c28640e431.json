    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a partially enclosed architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, adorned with a golden crown and halo, holds the Christ Child. She wears a blue mantle and holds a small pear-like object. Behind her, a richly patterned textile hangs. To the right, three Magi are present. One kneels, offering a golden vessel, while another stands, holding a similar offering and gesturing with his hand. A third figure, also crowned, stands behind them. The architecture includes a wooden structure with a pitched roof and visible beams, suggesting a stable or humble dwelling. Rays of light emanate from the upper right, illuminating the scene and a star above. In the background, hints of animals and a landscape are visible.",
