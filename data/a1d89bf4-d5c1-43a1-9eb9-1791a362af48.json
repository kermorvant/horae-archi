    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a golden halo, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child who is also haloed. She wears a blue mantle over a brown garment. Joseph, with a grey beard and wearing a dark hat and blue tunic, walks beside the donkey, carrying a staff over his shoulder with a bag and flask attached. He is cloaked in a pink garment. The scene unfolds in a verdant landscape with trees and rolling hills. In the background, a fortified castle with towers and spires is visible under a cloudy sky. The entire scene is framed by an ornate border with floral motifs.",
