    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds. In the foreground, three shepherds are gathered with their flock of sheep and a dog. One shepherd, seated and playing a pipe, looks upwards. Another shepherd, standing and gesturing with his hands, also looks up. A third shepherd, to the left, points towards the sky. Above them, an angel with blue wings descends, holding a banner that reads \"Gloria in altissimum Deo et in terra pax hominibus\" (Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men). In the background, a walled city with towers and buildings is visible, set against a mountainous landscape. The entire scene is framed by ornate architectural borders with figures of saints on either side.",
