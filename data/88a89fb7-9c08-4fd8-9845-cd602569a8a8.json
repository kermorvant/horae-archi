    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures standing beneath a large arch. On the left, a figure with long, wavy hair and a draped garment faces two bearded men. The central figure gestures with his right hand, while the figure on the right stands with his hands clasped. Behind them, a building with a prominent vertical element, possibly a tower or a doorway, is visible. The overall impression is of a narrative moment, possibly a discussion or a confrontation, set within an architectural context.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too generic to definitively interpret a specific religious or biblical event without further context or identifying attributes of the figures. It could represent a moment from the Gospels, a scene from the Old Testament, or a hagiographic narrative.",
