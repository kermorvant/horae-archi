    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man with a halo, dressed in a reddish-brown robe and a blue undergarment, kneels on the ground. He holds a scroll or parchment in his left hand and gestures with his right. Beside him, a lamb with a golden halo stands, looking towards the man. The scene is set in a rolling green landscape with stylized trees and hills in the background under a blue sky. The overall impression is one of a devotional or biblical scene set in a natural environment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure is likely John the Baptist, identified by his traditional iconography of a beard, halo, and often depicted with a lamb, symbolizing Christ as the \"Lamb of God.\" The gesture and scroll suggest a prophetic or preaching context.",
