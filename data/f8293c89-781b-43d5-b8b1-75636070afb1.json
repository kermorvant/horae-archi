    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and white veil, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child. She has a golden halo. Behind her, two women with halos follow, one with reddish-brown hair and the other with blonde hair. To the left of the donkey, a man with a distinctive hat and a blue tunic, possibly Saint Joseph, walks alongside. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling green hills, trees, and a pale blue sky with golden streaks. The ground is rendered in pinkish-beige with black hatching and some green foliage. In the far distance, a rudimentary structure resembling a building with a pitched roof and windows is visible on a hill.",
