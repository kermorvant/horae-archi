    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Coronation of the Virgin Mary, with the Virgin kneeling in prayer, clad in a blue mantle with gold trim, her hands clasped. To her right, Christ, seated and holding an orb, extends his hand towards her, bestowing a crown. Above them, a host of cherubic figures, some with wings, are depicted in the celestial realm, with one group placing a crown upon the Virgin's head. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element, suggesting a divine or sacred space.",
