    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Catherine of Alexandria kneeling in prayer before a large breaking wheel, her hands clasped. A crowd of onlookers, some with spears, gaze upwards towards a divine light emanating from the upper right corner. Another figure, possibly a tormentor, lies prostrate on the ground near Catherine. The background suggests an outdoor setting with a stylized landscape and sky. The breaking wheel, a symbol of her martyrdom, is prominently featured, along with the radiant divine intervention.",
