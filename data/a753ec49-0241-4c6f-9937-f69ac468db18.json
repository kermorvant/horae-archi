    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of male figures, all with golden halos, are depicted standing on a green checkered ground. The two central figures are more prominent. The figure on the left, dressed in blue and holding an open book, has a key in his left hand. The figure on the right, also in blue, holds a sword. Other figures, in green, pink, and gold robes, surround them. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element with a red, gold-decorated background, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The overall impression is of a gathering of saints or apostles, possibly in a moment of theological discussion or representation of their martyrdom.",
