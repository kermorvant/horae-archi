    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession of five women, two of whom are identified as martyrs by their halos and the swords they carry. An angel with golden wings stands between them, holding a staff. Above, in a celestial band of clouds, three figures, likely representing the Holy Trinity or saints, are depicted reading a book. The figures are walking on a path in front of a cityscape with various buildings, including a small church on the left. The overall scene suggests a religious narrative, possibly a martyrdom or a procession of saints.",
