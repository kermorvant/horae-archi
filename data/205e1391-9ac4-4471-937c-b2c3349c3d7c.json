    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a lush, green landscape. On the left, a bearded man wearing a red robe over a blue garment, lined with ermine, holds a book with inscribed tablets, likely representing Moses and the Ten Commandments. The inscription \"moses\" is visible on his blue robe. He gestures with his right hand. On the right, a figure identified as Christ stands holding a wooden cross, which is planted on a golden orb. Christ wears a pink robe and raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing or greeting. He has a halo with a cross inscribed within it. The background features rolling hills, stylized trees, and a distant cityscape with towers and birds in the sky. The overall setting is pastoral and somewhat idealized.",
