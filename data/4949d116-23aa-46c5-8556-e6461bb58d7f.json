A crowd of soldiers and onlookers surrounds the base of the crosses. Above Christ, God the Father is depicted in a radiant halo, blessing the scene. The sky is dark, with a crescent moon visible. The scene is framed by an ornate border with floral motifs. The overall impression is one of solemnity and divine witness to the sacrifice.",
