    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a stable-like structure, framed by an ornate, arched canopy. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies swaddled in a manger, attended by the Virgin Mary, who is dressed in a blue mantle and red tunic, and Saint Joseph, who wears a hooded cloak over a red garment. A cow and a donkey are positioned behind the manger, their heads bowed. The background reveals a pastoral landscape with rolling hills and scattered trees under a blue sky with clouds from which rays of light descend. The entire scene is bordered by decorative elements characteristic of illuminated manuscripts, including floral motifs and gold leaf.",
