    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, crowned and with a halo, sits holding the Christ Child. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is dressed in orange and holds a green orb. One of the Magi, kneeling and bearded, offers a gift from an open book. Two other Magi stand behind him, one wearing a crown and the other a green cap. The figures are set against a gold background, framed by architectural elements that suggest a Gothic style, including pointed arches and decorative tracery. The scene is richly decorated with gold leaf.",
