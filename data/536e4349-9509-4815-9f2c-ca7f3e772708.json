Next to him, an older man with a white beard and a pink and gold crown wears a yellow tunic. To his right, a man with a beard and a red turban wears a blue tunic. The man on the far right, seated and wearing a yellow robe with a blue collar adorned with gold fleur-de-lis, also wears a white and gold crown. Behind them, a window with diamond-shaped panes is visible, and to the left, a distant cityscape with towers and a green, hilly landscape can be seen. The scene appears to be set within an interior space looking out onto a landscape and city.",
