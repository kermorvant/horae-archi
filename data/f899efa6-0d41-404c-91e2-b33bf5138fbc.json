    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman in a white gown kneeling in prayer on a green grassy field, her hands clasped. Around her, several figures lie prostrate and appear to be dead or injured, some amidst broken wooden structures. In the background, a walled city with towers and a river with a boat are visible. Above, an angelic figure with red wings flies through a cloudy sky, and a distant castle sits atop a hill. The overall impression is one of disaster and divine intervention or judgment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a miraculous event or divine judgment, possibly related to a plague or a catastrophic event where a saint or holy figure's intercession is sought or where divine wrath is being displayed. The presence of fallen figures and the prayerful woman suggests a plea for mercy or a testament to faith amidst destruction.",
