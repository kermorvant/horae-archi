    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a bearded man wearing a helmet or crown with decorative elements. He is dressed in a tunic with two prominent buttons. The background is filled with a dotted pattern, suggesting a stylized representation of foliage or a celestial sphere. The figure is framed by architectural elements that appear to be columns or pilasters, topped with an ornate arch. The overall style is that of a woodcut or engraving, common in medieval manuscripts.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is likely a portrait of a biblical or historical figure, possibly a king or a prophet, given the regal headwear and beard. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific scene interpretation is not possible. It could represent a figure from the Old Testament, a saint, or even a symbolic representation of a virtue or concept.",
