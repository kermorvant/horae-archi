    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in prayer, kneeling with his hands clasped, facing a monstrous, multi-headed serpent or dragon. The creature is depicted with numerous heads, each with a distinct face and open mouth, suggesting aggression or torment. In the background, a town with buildings and a prominent church tower is visible, set against a landscape. To the right of the praying man, a large, indistinct form, possibly a rock or a tomb, is present, with foliage suggesting a natural setting. The overall composition suggests a struggle between good and evil, with the man's piety confronting the demonic entity.",
