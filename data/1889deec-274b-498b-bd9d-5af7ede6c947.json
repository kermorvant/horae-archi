    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, including the Virgin Mary, praying with their hands clasped and looking upwards. They are seated or kneeling around a red-draped altar or lectern, upon which rests an open book. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light and flames, symbolizing divine inspiration. To the right, a figure in a monastic habit stands within an architectural niche, gesturing as if preaching or speaking. The background features a decorative red tapestry with gold foliage and a glimpse of architectural elements, including columns and windows, suggesting an interior setting.",
