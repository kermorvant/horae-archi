In the foreground, two male shepherds, one playing a horn and the other holding a staff, stand near a dog. A woman in a red dress kneels, gently interacting with a lamb. Sheep and a cow graze in the grassy fields. In the background, a river flows under a bridge leading to a walled city with a prominent castle. Above the city, a celestial scene unfolds with God the Father enthroned amidst angels and a host of heavenly figures, suggesting a divine presence overseeing the earthly realm. The overall composition evokes a sense of peace and divine protection over the pastoral life.",
