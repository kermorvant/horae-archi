    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure with long blonde hair and a halo is seated on the ground, dressed in a blue robe and a red mantle. She is reading a book open in her lap. To her right is a large wooden wheel, and to her left, a sword is laid on the ground. The setting is outdoors, with a low stone wall behind the figure, and a green grassy area in the foreground. In the background, there are rolling hills and a body of water under a pale blue sky. The presence of the wheel and sword strongly suggests this is a depiction of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, whose martyrdom involved torture on a breaking wheel and subsequent beheading.",
