    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely the Virgin Mary, stands draped in a blue robe adorned with small red and white dots, and a blue veil covering her head. She leans on a staff topped with a cross-like finial. Her gaze is directed downwards with a somber expression. Beneath her feet, a red, dragon-like creature with sharp claws is being subdued, its body coiled and its head turned upwards. The background is a shimmering gold, suggesting a divine or celestial setting, framed by decorative borders of blue, red, and white patterns.",
