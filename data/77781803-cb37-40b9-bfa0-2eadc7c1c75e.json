    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, wavy hair and a jeweled headdress stands in an architectural setting. She is wearing a long, flowing gown with a decorative belt. Her left hand holds a banner inscribed with text and circular motifs, while her right hand is raised, pointing. The background features architectural elements, including a column on the left and an ornate, arched canopy above the figure, suggesting an interior or a structured outdoor space.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a figure from the Old Testament or a saint, possibly holding a scroll or banner with a prophecy or significant text. The specific iconography of the banner and the figure's gesture would be key to a precise identification, but without further context or clearer inscription, a definitive interpretation is not possible. It could represent a prophetess or a figure associated with divine revelation.",
