    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bishop, identified by his mitre and robes, crowning a kneeling woman, presumably the Virgin Mary, with a golden crown. The bishop holds a golden orb in his left hand. Behind the kneeling woman are two other women, also with hands clasped in prayer. To the left, a winged figure, likely an angel, is partially visible. The background features a blue, patterned drapery and a green canopy with gold embellishments. Rays of golden light emanate from above, suggesting divine intervention. The overall setting appears to be a celestial or sacred space, indicated by the presence of divine light and angelic figures.",
