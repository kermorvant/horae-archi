    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a circular, textured area that appears to be a stylized representation of a well or a pool of water. The texture suggests rough stone or earth, with a darker, possibly wet, interior. The surrounding area is a flat, ochre-colored background, typical of manuscript illumination, with a red border at the bottom. The overall impression is of a simple, symbolic depiction of a water source.",
