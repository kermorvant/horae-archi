    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated and breastfeeding the Christ Child, who is held in her arms. To the left, a bearded man, presumably Saint Joseph, looks on with his hand resting on Mary's shoulder. Behind them, a simplified architectural structure with towers and crenellations suggests a town or castle. The background is filled with diagonal lines, possibly representing a roof or a stylized sky. The overall composition is intimate, focusing on the tender interaction between mother and child, with the presence of Saint Joseph grounding the scene in a domestic or familial context.",
