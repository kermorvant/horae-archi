    "scene_description_enriched": "A lone figure, likely Christ, is depicted carrying a large cross. The figure wears a dark robe and appears to be walking on a grassy or field-like ground. Above the figure, a halo surrounds the head, and a band of text in a Gothic script arches over the scene, likely containing a devotional or biblical inscription. The figure's posture suggests exertion and burden as they bear the weight of the cross.",
