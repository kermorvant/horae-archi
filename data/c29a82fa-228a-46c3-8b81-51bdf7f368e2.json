One bird, white with black markings, is perched on a stem. Another bird, with blue and grey plumage, is shown upside down, its beak near a red and blue flower. A third bird, with yellow and blue feathers, is depicted with its beak open, near a blue and red flower. A fourth bird, with blue and white plumage, is seen in the upper left, its wings spread. The background is a textured gold leaf, suggesting a precious or divine setting. The overall composition is a vibrant display of natural elements, likely intended as an ornamental flourish within a manuscript.",
