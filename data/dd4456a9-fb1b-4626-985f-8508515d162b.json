    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, with hands clasped in prayer and a halo, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies in a manger. To the right, Saint Joseph, also with a halo, sits with his hand raised in a gesture of blessing or awe. Two oxen are present, one looking towards the viewer and the other towards the child. Behind them, a wooden structure with a pitched roof is visible, and through an opening, a group of figures, possibly shepherds or onlookers, are seen in the distance against a landscape. The scene is framed by a decorative border on the left with floral motifs.",
