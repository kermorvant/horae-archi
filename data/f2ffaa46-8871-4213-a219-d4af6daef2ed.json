    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child swaddled in white. Saint Joseph, with a beard and blue cloak, walks beside the donkey, carrying a bundle on a staff over his shoulder. They are in a landscape with rolling green hills and scattered trees. In the background, a city with numerous towers and spires is visible across a body of water, bathed in golden rays emanating from above, suggesting divine light or a heavenly presence.",
