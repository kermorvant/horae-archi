    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a flock of sheep grazing on a green hillside. In the foreground, a young shepherd, dressed in a blue robe and red hood, is seated and tending to his footwear, with a discarded shoe beside him. Above and behind him, on a higher elevation amidst lush greenery, a crowned figure, identified as Saint Eligius by his attributes, holds a golden orb and a cross. In the background, a city with prominent church towers and a body of water with a boat are visible, nestled between rolling hills and rocky outcrops. The overall composition suggests a divine vision or intervention within a humble, earthly setting.",
