    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pentecost, with the Holy Spirit descending as a dove from a divine realm. Above, God the Father, crowned and with a halo, and another bearded figure, also with a halo, are depicted within a celestial setting of blue clouds and red starry background. Rays of light emanate from the dove, illuminating the group of figures below. These figures, dressed in various colored robes and habits, are gathered together, looking upwards with expressions of awe and devotion. Some are holding books, suggesting they are engaged in prayer or study. The setting is a simple, green ground, with no discernible architectural elements in the immediate vicinity.",
