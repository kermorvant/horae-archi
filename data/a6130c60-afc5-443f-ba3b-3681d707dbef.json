    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, gesturing towards the Virgin Mary on the right. Gabriel, with long auburn hair and a halo, wears a golden robe over a white tunic and is seated. Mary, also with auburn hair and a halo, is depicted kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a golden robe. Above them, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove, radiating light. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the architectural elements such as columns, arches, and a background wall with decorative patterns. The floor is tiled. The overall scene is framed by ornamental architectural elements.",
