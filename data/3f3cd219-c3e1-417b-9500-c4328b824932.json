    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a simple wooden stable. The Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue mantle and white veil, cradles the Christ Child on her lap. The Child reaches out to receive gifts from the three Magi, who are presented as kings wearing crowns. The first Magus, on the left, offers a chalice. The second, kneeling before Mary, presents a vessel. The third, on the right, holds a similar vessel. The background features a red textile with gold patterns, and the roof of the stable is constructed of exposed wooden beams. A star is visible in the blue sky above the stable.",
