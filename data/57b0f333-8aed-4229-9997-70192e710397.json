He is dressed in a blue tunic and a yellow cloak. In the foreground, a decorative initial 'D' is visible, followed by Latin text. To the right, a group of figures are gathered around a table, seemingly engaged in a meal, with one figure in green appearing to be a demon or temptress. Further to the right, a staircase leads upwards, and two figures are conversing. The overall composition is framed by architectural elements, suggesting a narrative sequence or devotional representation.",
