    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Baptist standing in a verdant landscape. He is shown with a halo, wearing a simple tunic and barefoot. To his right, a lamb, also with a halo, stands attentively. In the background, a stone structure, possibly a tomb or altar, is visible, along with some foliage and a body of water. A wooden structure resembling a balance scale or a frame is present to the left of the saint. The overall impression is one of a pastoral setting, emphasizing the ascetic life of the saint.",
