    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint or scribe, is depicted writing on a scroll at a wooden lectern. The figure wears a blue mantle over a pinkish-brown robe and an orange cap. To the left, a lion-like creature with a scroll draped around its neck sits on the floor. The scene is set within an arched architectural frame, suggesting an interior space. The background features green patterned walls and a mosaic-like tiled area. A small potted plant with orange flowers is visible to the right. The overall impression is one of scholarly or devotional activity within a richly decorated setting.",
