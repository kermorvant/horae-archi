    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel in dynamic action, poised to strike with a sword raised high in his right hand. He wears a golden cuirass over a white tunic and a flowing pink cloak lined with green. In his left hand, he holds a staff topped with a cross. He stands over a defeated, dragon-like creature, its dark, serpentine form writhing beneath his feet. The background is a warm, golden-brown, suggesting a divine or otherworldly setting. The overall composition emphasizes the triumph of good over evil.",
