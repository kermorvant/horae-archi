    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and the cross she holds, is depicted riding a fearsome red beast, possibly a dragon or a lion-like monster, which is trampling a blue garment. The saint, dressed in a blue robe, looks upwards, her hands clasped around the cross. Above and to the left, a hand emerges from a blue sky, holding a golden disc, perhaps representing divine intervention or a celestial event. The background is a rich tapestry of red and gold squares, suggesting a divine or regal setting. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
