    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Entombment of Christ. Christ's body, pale and marked, is being carefully laid onto a richly decorated bier covered by a blue cloth. Several figures surround the bier. On the left, a man in a green robe and a conical hat supports Christ's head. To his right, another man, also with a conical hat, anoints Christ's body with a vessel. In the center, a woman in an orange robe and white veil, likely the Virgin Mary, looks down with sorrow. On the right, a man wearing a crown and a blue cloak, possibly Joseph of Arimathea, supports Christ's feet. The background is a shimmering gold, suggesting a divine or sacred context. The bier itself is adorned with quatrefoil motifs.",
