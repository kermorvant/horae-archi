    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, dressed in a striped robe and kneeling on a red cloth, clasps his hands in prayer. He is in an interior setting, with a bed visible to his right and a table covered with a striped cloth to his left, upon which rests a blue and gold cap. Above and behind him, a celestial vision appears within a red halo against a blue sky, depicting a figure with a beard, possibly a prophet or divine messenger, gesturing with one hand. The background features ornate, gold-patterned walls and architectural elements suggesting a richly decorated room, possibly a chamber or a study. The scene likely represents a moment of divine revelation or prayerful communion.",
