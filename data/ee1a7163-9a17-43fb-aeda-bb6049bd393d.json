    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ kneeling on a dark, rocky terrain, with a golden background suggesting a divine or ethereal setting. He is shown with a halo, wearing a pink tunic and blue mantle, and is reaching towards a chalice held in his hands. To the left, three figures with halos are depicted in various states of distress or slumber. One figure, in a blue mantle and pink garment, rests his head on his arm. Another, in a red tunic and green mantle, clutches his stomach, appearing pained. A third figure, also in a red tunic and blue mantle, is partially obscured, with his head bowed. The overall composition suggests a moment of profound emotional and spiritual significance.",
