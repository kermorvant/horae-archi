    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary kneels before a lectern with an open book, her hands raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. A canopy bed is visible behind her. On the right, the Angel Gabriel kneels, holding a scroll inscribed with \"Ave Maria\". Rays of light descend from above, symbolizing divine intervention, and a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is depicted in the upper center. The figures are set against a patterned tapestry and a tiled floor, framed by arches and architectural elements suggesting an interior space.",
