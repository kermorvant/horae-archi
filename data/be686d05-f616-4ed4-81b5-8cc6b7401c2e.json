    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of clerics engaged in a religious service within an interior architectural space. On the left, several figures in clerical robes, some wearing blue and gold vestments, stand and appear to be chanting or singing from a lectern holding an open book. To the right, two figures in black monastic habits are seated, one intently reading from a book. The setting is richly decorated with ornate textiles, including a red tapestry with gold floral motifs and green curtains. Architectural elements such as arched windows with tracery and columns are visible in the background, suggesting a church or chapel interior. The overall impression is one of solemn devotion and liturgical practice.",
