    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, with the Virgin Mary riding a donkey, holding the Christ Child. Saint Joseph, an elderly man with a beard, walks beside the donkey, holding a staff. To the right, a figure in white armor, possibly a soldier or guard, stands near an ornate architectural portal. The background features a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a distant city or castle. The overall scene is rendered with gold leaf accents, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
