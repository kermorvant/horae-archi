He wears a blue robe over a garment with red and green accents. The background is gold, and the oval frame is composed of concentric blue and yellow bands, decorated with white swirling motifs and pink floral elements. This imagery likely represents King David, often depicted with a harp or musical instrument, and associated with the Psalms.",
