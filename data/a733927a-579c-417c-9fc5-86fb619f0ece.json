    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a nude male figure standing in a landscape. He is facing forward, with his left arm bent and holding a dark, round object, possibly a stone or a skull. His right hand is placed over his lower abdomen. The background features a blue sky with some clouds, a green grassy ground, and a bare tree on the right. A small animal, possibly a fox or a dog, is visible near the figure's feet. The scene is framed by an ornamental border, suggesting it is part of a manuscript illumination. The figure's posture and nudity, along with the presence of the animal and the barren tree, evoke the theme of penitence or the Fall of Man.",
