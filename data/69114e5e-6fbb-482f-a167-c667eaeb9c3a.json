    "scene_description_enriched": "Three bearded men, depicted in profile and facing left, are shown from the chest up. They are dressed in medieval attire, including hooded garments and tunics. The man on the left wears a cap and a richly decorated outer garment. The central figure has a hood pulled up, and the figure on the right wears a cap and a tunic with a prominent circular pendant on a chain. All three men have their hands clasped in prayer or supplication, and their gazes are directed upwards, suggesting a moment of devotion or petition. The scene lacks any architectural context, implying a focus on the figures and their spiritual state.",
