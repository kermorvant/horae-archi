    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, stands in a pastoral landscape. The figure wears a flowing reddish-brown robe over a white garment and holds a palm frond, a symbol of martyrdom, in their right hand. Their left hand clutches a small pouch filled with what appears to be grain or seeds. The background features rolling green hills, stylized trees, and distant blue mounds, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figure's gaze is directed upwards and to the right, with a serene expression.",
