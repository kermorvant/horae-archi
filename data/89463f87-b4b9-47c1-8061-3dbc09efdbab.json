    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with a golden halo stands in the foreground, holding a tall, cylindrical object that resembles a reliquary or a candle holder. She wears a blue mantle over a golden dress. Behind her, a wall with arched windows is depicted, suggesting an architectural setting. To the right, a figure with a halo, possibly an angel, leans forward, holding a scroll with text that appears to be \"E. DAUDA\". The floor is tiled in a black and red diamond pattern. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure with the reliquary is likely a saint, possibly Saint Barbara, who is often depicted with a tower, which this object might represent in a stylized form. The presence of the scroll with text and the angel suggests a narrative or devotional context, possibly related to a vision or a divine message.",
