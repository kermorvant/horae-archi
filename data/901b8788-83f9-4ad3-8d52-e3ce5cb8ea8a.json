    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded men stand facing each other, holding a golden scroll that unfurls between them. The man on the left wears a red and gold patterned hat and a golden robe over a blue tunic. He holds the scroll in his left hand, which is inscribed with the letters \"S.D.R.\". The man on the right wears a conical red hat with a tassel and a blue robe. He holds the scroll in his right hand, and the word \"Abraham\" is prominently written on it. The background depicts a landscape with a body of water, boats, trees, and distant buildings, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall scene is rendered with rich colors and gilded details, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
