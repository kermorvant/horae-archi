    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal figure, likely King David, seated and holding a crown, gesturing with his right hand. Before him, the Virgin Mary kneels in prayer, adorned with a crown. Above them, several angels are depicted, some with wings spread, seemingly descending or attending. One angel plays a harp-like instrument, while another holds a similar instrument. In the background, a row of figures, possibly a heavenly host or saints, are visible against a blue backdrop. The architectural setting is suggested by ornate golden columns and decorative arches, creating a sense of a grand, possibly celestial, interior.",
