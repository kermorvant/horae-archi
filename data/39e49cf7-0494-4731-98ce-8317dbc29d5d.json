    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal or divine coronation, possibly the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. A crowned figure, likely Christ, is shown placing a crown on the head of the Virgin Mary, who is kneeling. They are surrounded by several figures. To the left of the Virgin are two younger figures, one with hands clasped in prayer and another holding a small object. Above them, a group of angels are depicted playing musical instruments, including a lyre and a harp, in a celestial setting suggested by clouds and stars. Another angel is positioned between the earthly and heavenly realms. The background features a decorative, patterned textile, and the overall composition is framed by an arched border with floral motifs.",
