    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an architectural setting. On the left, Christ, with a halo, stands behind a railing, his wounds visible. Before him, a kneeling figure, likely a bishop or high-ranking cleric due to his mitre and ornate robes, reads from an open book, hands clasped in prayer. He is attended by several other figures, some wearing helmets, suggesting a context of protection or authority. An altar with a chalice and paten is present, along with other vessels and a candlestick. The background features architectural elements suggesting an interior space, possibly a chapel or church.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Mass or a similar liturgical event, possibly with a vision of Christ appearing to a devout worshipper. The presence of the chalice and paten, along with Christ's wounds, points to the Eucharist. The kneeling figure's posture and attire indicate deep reverence and prayer during a sacred ritual.",
