    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crowning with Thorns. Christ, seated on a chair, is being subjected to this act by two tormentors. One figure in a blue tunic places a crown of thorns on Christ's head, while another in an orange and gold tunic presses down on it with a stick. Christ's hands are bound, and he wears a simple pink robe. The floor is tiled in a green diamond pattern. In the background, a red wall with arched windows and a decorative frieze is visible. To the left, through an arched opening, a group of figures and a stylized tree are seen, with a distant view of a walled city under a starry sky. The overall setting suggests an interior space with an opening to an exterior view.",
