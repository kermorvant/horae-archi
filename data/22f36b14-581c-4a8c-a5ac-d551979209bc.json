    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. At the center, the Virgin Mary, with hands clasped in prayer and a halo, kneels beside the Christ Child, who lies naked on a bed of straw. Joseph, also with clasped hands and a halo, stands behind them. To the left, several figures in medieval attire, some with hoods, observe the scene, one holding a staff. To the right, an angel descends from the sky, appearing to announce the birth to shepherds who are tending their flock. A cow and a donkey are also present in the stable. The architectural elements suggest a simple wooden structure with arched openings and columns, framing the central figures. The background shows a landscape with trees and buildings, and a star shines in the night sky.",
