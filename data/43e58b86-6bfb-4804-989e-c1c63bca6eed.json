    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central figure, possibly Christ, who is gesturing with his hands. To the right of this central figure, a woman with long hair is shown with her hands clasped, possibly in prayer or supplication. She is seated. On the left, three men are visible, one wearing a cap and the other two with beards. The background suggests an architectural setting with arched elements and vertical lines, possibly representing windows or a vaulted ceiling. The overall composition suggests a moment of interaction or teaching.",
