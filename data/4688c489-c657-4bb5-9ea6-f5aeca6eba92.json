    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and bearing wounds, standing before a wooden cross. He is partially obscured by the cross, with his right hand touching his chest and his left hand resting on his hip. He wears a white loincloth. Scattered around him are various instruments of the Passion, including a ladder, a hammer, tongs, a lance, a scourge, and dice. To the left, a stone structure resembling an altar or tomb is visible, topped with three vessels. Above this, a column and several portrait busts of individuals, including a figure in a bishop's mitre, are depicted against a red background. To the right, more instruments are displayed, including a scythe-like blade and a ladder leaning against the cross. The overall impression is one of solemnity and contemplation of Christ's suffering and the events surrounding the Crucifixion.",
