    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Archangel Gabriel, with blue and gold wings and a red and gold cloak, approaches the Virgin Mary. He holds a golden staff and gestures towards her. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, kneels on the right, her hands raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. She is looking towards the angel. In front of her is an open book on a patterned stand. Behind the figures, architectural elements suggest an interior space, with large columns and a glimpse of a landscape through an opening. The background features a richly decorated red panel with gold ornamentation.",
