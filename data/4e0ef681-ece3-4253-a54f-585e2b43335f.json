    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a body of water, likely a river or sea, dotted with sailing vessels. On the left, three shepherds stand in a grassy field, looking upwards. The central shepherd, dressed in blue, clasps his hands in prayer. In the upper portion of the image, a winged angelic figure emerges from a radiant sky, holding a scroll that reads \"Gloria in excelsis Deo.\" In the middle ground, on a rocky outcrop, other figures are visible, including one seated and another standing, also seemingly observing the celestial event. A flock of sheep grazes peacefully in the foreground.",
