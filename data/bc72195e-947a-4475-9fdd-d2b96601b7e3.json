    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable structure with a thatched roof supported by wooden beams. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle over a burgundy gown, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, her gaze downcast. Beside her, Saint Joseph, clad in a red robe and blue hood, also kneels with hands joined in prayer, looking upwards. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies on the ground, radiating a golden halo and light, with his arms outstretched. Behind the figures, a tapestry with a sunburst motif is visible. The background opens to a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a distant town with red-roofed buildings and towers. The overall scene is one of humble adoration and the divine birth.",
