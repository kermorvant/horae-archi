    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and monastic habit, stands centrally. She wears a white habit with a black mantle trimmed in gold, and a white veil. In her left hand, she holds a red book, and in her right, a golden crosier. A grey rat is depicted climbing on her habit near the bottom. The background suggests an architectural setting with brown brick walls and a blue curtain adorned with golden fleur-de-lis motifs. To the sides, through openings, a green landscape with trees is visible. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern of blue and green.",
