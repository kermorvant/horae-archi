She wears a blue garment with gold cross-hatching and a pink outer robe, both richly decorated with gold. In her left hand, she holds a pair of long, thin instruments, possibly related to her martyrdom. The background depicts a stylized blue sky with scattered clouds, a distant blue architectural structure, and a cluster of green trees on the right. The scene is framed by a gold border.",
