    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, flowing hair, wearing a simple tunic, is depicted seated. Her hands are clasped over her lap, and she appears to be interacting with a small animal, possibly a dog or a fox, which is resting its head on her leg. In the background, to the left, a simplified representation of buildings with pitched roofs suggests a village or town setting. The overall scene is rendered in a woodcut style with bold outlines and hatching.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a scene of domesticity or a pastoral moment. Without further iconographic clues, a specific religious interpretation is difficult. However, the presence of animals and a solitary female figure can evoke themes of companionship, nature, or even penitence if interpreted in a broader devotional context.",
