    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an outdoor setting, though architectural elements are suggested in the background. At the center, a man, presumably Christ, is shown struggling under the weight of a large cross, which he carries with his hands and shoulders. He is surrounded by several other figures, some of whom appear to be tormentors or onlookers, with expressions of exertion or indifference. The figures are rendered in a somewhat stylized manner, typical of woodcut illustrations. The background suggests a building with arches and decorative elements, hinting at a city or religious structure.",
