The angel holds a scroll inscribed with \"Gloria in exelsis Deo.\" Below, two shepherds are tending their flock of sheep and a goat in a green, hilly landscape. One shepherd, wearing a blue hood and pink tunic, stands and looks up at the angel, holding a staff. The other shepherd, in a blue robe, sits and also gazes upwards. In the background, a pink building with spires, possibly a church, is visible amidst trees.",
