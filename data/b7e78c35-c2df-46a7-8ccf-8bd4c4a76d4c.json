    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a radiant manger. To the right, Saint Joseph, in a red robe and blue hood, holds a candle and gazes at the child. Behind them, a donkey's head is visible. In the background, through an opening, a pastoral landscape with buildings and trees is depicted, bathed in divine light rays streaming from above. To the left, two figures, possibly shepherds, are present, one holding a staff. The scene is framed by an ornate border.",
