    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral landscape, two shepherds tend to their flock of sheep, accompanied by a dog. One shepherd, kneeling, gestures upwards, while the other stands, holding a staff and looking towards the sky. Above them, an angel descends from a radiant sky, holding a banner with the inscription \"Gloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.\" In the background, a town with a prominent tower and a fortified castle are visible by a body of water. The scene likely depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a key event in the Nativity narrative.",
