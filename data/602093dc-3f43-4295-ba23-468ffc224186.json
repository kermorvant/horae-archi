    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Jesus, clad in a blue robe with gold trim, standing and gesturing with his right hand. Before him, a man lies on the ground, wrapped in a white shroud, with his hands clasped in prayer. To Jesus's right, a woman kneels, also with hands clasped, and another woman stands behind her. A group of men, some pointing, stand to Jesus's left. In the background, a stone wall with an arched opening suggests an architectural setting, with trees and buildings visible beyond. This scene is interpreted as the Raising of Lazarus, a miracle where Jesus brings Lazarus back to life after he had been dead for four days.",
