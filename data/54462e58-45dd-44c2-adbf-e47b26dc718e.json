    "scene_description_enriched": "Three haloed figures are depicted standing vertically. The uppermost figure wears a red robe over a blue garment and holds a book and a palm frond. The middle figure, also in a red robe over blue, holds a book. The lowest figure, in a red robe over blue, holds a staff with a diamond-shaped finial. The background is a mottled wash of green and yellow, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figures are likely saints, possibly martyrs given the palm fronds.",
