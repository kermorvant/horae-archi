    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned man, identified as David, kneels in prayer before a golden harp-like instrument. He wears a royal blue mantle lined with ermine over a purple robe, and a golden crown. Behind him, a richly decorated red canopy with gold patterns suggests a royal chamber. To the left, a landscape with rolling green hills and stylized trees is visible, with distant blue structures that might represent buildings. Above, in a celestial blue sky, a figure, likely God or an angel, is depicted within a halo, with rays of light emanating downwards. The scene depicts David in prayer, a common motif in Books of Hours, often associated with repentance or seeking divine guidance.",
