    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. In the foreground, a central figure, likely Christ due to his halo, is seated and gesturing with his right hand towards another bearded man who is also seated. To the left of the central figure, two other men are visible, one pointing. In the background, behind a column and architectural elements, two more figures are seen, one looking towards the main group. The architecture suggests a building with arches and decorative elements, possibly a church or a public building.",
