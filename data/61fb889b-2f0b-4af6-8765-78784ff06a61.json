    "scene_description_enriched": "A man wearing a blue cap, a red and gold tunic, and blue hose is depicted tending to a fire. He holds a long stick, possibly a poker, which he is using to stir the flames within a hearth. To the left, a blue goat is shown leaping against a bright blue sky with a suggestion of landscape below. The background suggests an interior space with architectural elements, including what appears to be a large, draped curtain or tapestry behind the hearth. The scene likely represents the zodiac sign Capricorn, often depicted as a goat, and the associated activities or imagery of the month.",
