    "scene_description_enriched": "An elephant, adorned with a blue cloth and a decorative band, carries a tower-like structure on its back. The tower is constructed of white brick with an orange crenellated parapet and a blue domed roof. A person with blonde hair, wearing a blue tunic, stands within the tower, blowing a horn. To the left, a figure resembling a wild man is depicted drawing a bow and arrow. The scene is set against a red background with decorative white scrollwork. The text 'ginum' is visible to the left of the elephant.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a historical or allegorical event, possibly related to warfare or a procession. The presence of an elephant with a tower suggests a military context or a representation of exotic power. The figure with the bow and arrow could represent an archer or a symbolic figure. The horn blower might be signaling an advance or a call to attention. The text 'ginum' could be part of a larger inscription related to the scene.",
