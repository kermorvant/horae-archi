In the foreground, a kneeling figure in a hooded robe looks upwards with one hand raised. To their right, another figure kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a third figure, bearded and wearing a hooded cloak, points upwards towards a divine light descending from an angel in the sky. The landscape is hilly and dotted with trees and sheep. The scene is framed by architectural elements on the sides, including columns and decorative motifs, and a carved inscription above.",
