    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue mantle, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child is reaching out to one of the three kings, who is kneeling before them. The other two kings stand behind, one adjusting his crown and the other holding a golden vessel. They are all richly dressed and crowned, signifying their royal status. Behind them, a Gothic architectural structure with pointed arches and pinnacles is visible, set against a radiant gold background. A small, open chest filled with coins is placed on the ground near the kneeling king, representing his offering.",
