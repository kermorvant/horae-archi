    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king, seated and richly robed in blue and gold, gestures with his right hand towards two women. One woman, in a blue gown, holds a long sword, pointing it downwards. Beside her, another woman in a pink gown looks on. In front of the king, two unclothed children are depicted, one embracing the other. Behind the figures, a stone wall decorated with blue squares and golden stars forms the backdrop. Above this, a crenellated wall supports several small, gabled buildings with golden roofs, flanked by towers. The scene appears to be set within an architectural structure, possibly a hall or throne room, with an arched opening framing the view of the buildings and sky beyond.",
