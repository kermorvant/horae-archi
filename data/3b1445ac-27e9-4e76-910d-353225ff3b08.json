    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded figure, identified as God, with a golden halo, points his finger towards a turbulent body of water. He is depicted in a pink robe with gold trim, standing against a blue sky filled with golden clouds and rays of light emanating from the upper right. In the water, a small, indistinct figure appears to be struggling or submerged. The scene likely represents the creation of the world, specifically the separation of waters or the creation of sea creatures, as described in the Book of Genesis.",
