    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral landscape, a young man in a red hat and blue tunic wrestles a lion, holding its jaws open. To the right, a thatched-roof structure shelters beehives. In the background, a body of water reflects a castle with towers and spires. Further in the distance, a figure with a staff appears to be tending to sheep. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded border.",
