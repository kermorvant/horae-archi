    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with wings outstretched and kneeling, is shown in profile, looking upwards. He holds a scroll with an inscription, and a beam of light emanates from a head in the upper part of the frame, directed towards him. On the right, the Virgin Mary stands, also looking upwards, with her hands raised in a gesture of acceptance or surprise. She is holding a small book. The figures are set against a grid-like background, suggesting an interior space, and framed by decorative architectural elements. A small vase-like object is visible between the figures.",
