    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded monk, identified by his tonsure and halo, in a dark habit, surrounded by various animals and a serpentine creature. A lion is shown biting at the monk's robe, a goat-like animal is near his left leg, and a white, dog-like creature with sharp claws is at his feet, appearing to attack. A green, scaly, serpentine creature coils around the monk's arm and neck. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling hills and trees, rendered in shades of green and brown, with a textured gold background in the upper portion. To the far left, a small, red building with a dark opening is visible. The monk's hands are raised, one in a gesture of supplication or defense. This imagery represents the temptations and trials faced by a hermit saint in the wilderness.",
