    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures standing within an architectural frame. On the left, a younger figure, possibly a saint or an angel, wears a brown tunic and a white mantle, holding a processional cross aloft. To the right, an older, bearded man, likely a saint, is dressed in a grey robe and a yellow cloak, carrying a staff and a satchel. They are positioned in front of a landscape with mountains and trees, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figures appear to be in procession or engaged in a devotional act. The architectural frame is ornate, with decorative arches and columns, suggesting a stylized representation of a sacred space or a portal.",
