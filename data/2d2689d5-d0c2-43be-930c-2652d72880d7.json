    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial event with divine rays descending from a blue sky dotted with golden clouds. Below, three women in richly colored robes are shown. One woman in a blue gown is kneeling and reaching towards a cradle containing a swaddled infant. Two other women, one in a maroon gown and another in a green gown, stand behind her, also looking towards the infant. The ground is rendered with wavy lines, suggesting water or a stylized landscape. The overall impression is one of divine intervention and the presentation of a significant child.",
