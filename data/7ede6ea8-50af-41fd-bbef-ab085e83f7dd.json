    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crosier, stands in a richly decorated interior. He wears a red cope over a green tunic and holds an open book in his left hand, while his right hand rests on the crosier. The background is a golden tapestry with intricate patterns. To the left and right, architectural elements suggest an enclosed space, possibly a chapel or a niche, with arched openings revealing glimpses of windows with tracery and foliage outside. The overall scene depicts a devotional image of a saintly figure.",
