    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in a blue robe kneeling in prayer, looking upwards towards a crucifix. He has a beard and appears to be a hermit or monk. Beside him, a beaver sits and chews on a plant. In the background, a small chapel with a cross on its roof is nestled into a rocky hillside, where another figure is climbing. To the right of the kneeling man, a red cloak or robe is draped over an unseen object. The crucifixion scene is central, with Christ on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns. The background shows a body of water with ships and distant mountains and buildings, suggesting a landscape setting.",
