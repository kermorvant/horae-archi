    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Kiss of Judas, a pivotal moment in the Passion of Christ. Jesus, with a golden halo, is being embraced and kissed by Judas Iscariot, who is identifiable by his orange cloak and the act of betrayal. Jesus's face shows a serene expression, while blood trickles from a wound on his chest. Around them, a group of figures, some armed with spears, are apprehending Jesus. One figure in a blue tunic with gold patterns holds a sword or scythe-like weapon. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible, set against a blue sky with stylized clouds. The foreground is a green, undulating landscape. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs and gold ornamentation.",
