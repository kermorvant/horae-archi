    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a solemn moment with a central figure, likely Christ, standing in a blue, gold-striped tunic, his hands clasped. To his left, a robed figure in red and blue, wearing a distinctive red and gold patterned hat, sits on a blue throne-like structure. A young attendant in blue and red, wearing a blue cap, stands beside the seated figure, holding a shallow bowl. Behind Christ, a group of soldiers in green armor and helmets are visible, their faces stern. The background is a stylized representation of a wall or partition with vertical lines. The overall impression is one of judgment or accusation, with Christ presented before a figure of authority.",
