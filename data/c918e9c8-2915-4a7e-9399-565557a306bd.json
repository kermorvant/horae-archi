    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in a frontal pose, looking slightly to his left. He wears ornate liturgical vestments: a blue tunic with gold vertical stripes and red and gold trim, a golden chasuble draped over his shoulders, and a purple cope. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or teaching, while his left hand holds a golden crozier. A golden halo surrounds his head, indicating his sanctity. The background is a vibrant, flat blue, with a suggestion of a landscape rendered with diagonal grey lines at the bottom. The scene is framed by a brown border with gold accents.",
