    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint George on horseback, clad in golden armor, triumphantly spearing a green dragon. The dragon is shown with its mouth open and wings spread, impaled by a lance. In the background, a woman in a red and blue gown kneels on a rocky outcrop, possibly representing the princess or a supplicant. Further in the distance, a fortified castle with towers and spires is visible on a hill, suggesting a setting within a kingdom or a besieged city. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with text, indicating it is part of a larger manuscript.",
