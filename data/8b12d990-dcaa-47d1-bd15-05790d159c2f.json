    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as John the Baptist, kneels in a grassy landscape under a blue, cloud-filled sky. He wears a simple, draped garment and points towards a lamb. The lamb, also wearing a halo, stands on a hillock and looks towards John the Baptist. A red banner flies from a pole behind the lamb. The scene is rendered with a flat perspective and vibrant colors, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
