    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit, also known as Pentecost. A group of figures, all with golden halos, are gathered together. In the foreground, a figure in a red robe kneels before an open book. In the center, a woman in a blue robe looks upwards with her hands outstretched. Above them, rays of golden light descend from a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, which is surrounded by a radiant halo. The figures are enclosed within an architectural space, suggested by a red curtain and windows in the background. The overall impression is one of divine inspiration and spiritual fervor.",
