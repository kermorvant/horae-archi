    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border featuring grotesque figures and foliate motifs. On the left, a figure with a hooded head and a prominent nose is depicted. To its right, a grotesque face with wide eyes and an open mouth is centrally placed, surrounded by stylized foliage. Further to the right, another figure is partially visible, adorned with a crown-like headdress. The overall composition is ornamental and lacks a specific narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image appears to be a decorative border or initial from a medieval manuscript, likely intended to frame text or an illustration. The grotesque figures are common in medieval art and can symbolize various concepts, including the chaotic or the monstrous, or simply serve as decorative elements to ward off evil or add visual interest. Without further context or a central narrative scene, a specific religious interpretation is not possible.",
