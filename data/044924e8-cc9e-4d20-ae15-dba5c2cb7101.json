    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures, likely women, are depicted in profile, facing towards the right. The central figure wears a green garment and a light-colored veil, with her hands clasped in prayer. To her left, another figure in a brown garment and a green veil is visible, also with hands clasped. The figure on the far right, wearing a reddish-brown garment and a hood, looks upwards with hands clasped in prayer. The scene is rendered with simple lines and flat colors, typical of medieval manuscript illumination, with no discernible architectural setting or background.",
