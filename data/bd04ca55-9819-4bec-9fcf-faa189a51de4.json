    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two female figures in a verdant, hilly landscape. The figure on the left, dressed in a vibrant blue robe, stands with her hands clasped at her chest. The figure on the right kneels, her hands pressed together in prayer or supplication, and is draped in a pink cloak. Both figures have golden halos, indicating their saintly status. In the background, rolling green hills are dotted with trees and shrubs. A winding path is visible on one of the hills, and in the distance, a slender church spire emerges from behind a large, brown rock formation. Rays of light emanate from the top of the image, suggesting a divine presence or blessing. The overall setting is pastoral and serene, with a small architectural element hinting at civilization.",
