    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, in prayer. She is shown from the chest up, her head bowed and her hands clasped together in devotion. She wears a draped veil and tunic in muted tones of white and brown. The background is a rich, golden tapestry adorned with a repeating floral pattern of stylized flowers and scrolling vines, rendered in white and silver. Below the figure, a decorative architectural element, possibly a parapet or balustrade, is visible, featuring a series of white, cloud-like forms against a brown base, further embellished with delicate white tracery.",
