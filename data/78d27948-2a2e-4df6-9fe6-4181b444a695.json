    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man wearing a crown and a light-colored robe is seated on a red cushion, playing a harp-like instrument. He is depicted within a decorative initial 'D' formed by pink and blue elements, set against a gold leaf background. The man's posture and the instrument suggest a musical performance. This scene is likely an illustration of King David, often depicted with musical instruments in medieval art, particularly in the context of psalms.",
