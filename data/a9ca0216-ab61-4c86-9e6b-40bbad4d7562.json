    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in conversation, with two figures, possibly angels, standing behind the woman on the left. The woman on the right wears a veil and a patterned robe, while the woman on the left has long, flowing hair and wears a dark, plain robe. Behind them, a complex architectural structure resembling a castle or fortified city rises, complete with towers, crenellations, and windows. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a hilly landscape and sparse vegetation visible in the background. The overall composition suggests a narrative moment, possibly from a biblical or devotional text, where the interaction between the figures is central, set against an imposing architectural backdrop.",
