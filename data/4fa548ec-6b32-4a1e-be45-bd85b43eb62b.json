    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure with a long white beard and hair, dressed in a blue tunic and a reddish-brown cloak, stands indoors. He is holding a large wooden cross. The setting appears to be a room with light-colored walls, a green tiled floor, and two windows with tracery. The architectural elements suggest a domestic or monastic interior. The figure's pose and the presence of the cross strongly indicate a depiction of Saint Andrew, one of Christ's apostles, who is traditionally martyred on an X-shaped cross.",
