    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Coronation of the Virgin Mary, with Christ crowning her with a halo. To the left, a figure in a bishop's mitre and robes places a crown on Mary's head, while a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers above. To the right, a bearded figure, likely Christ, also places a hand on the crown. Behind them, a group of angels are depicted, some playing musical instruments like a lute and a flute, while others hold symbolic objects. The figures are set against a backdrop of architectural elements suggesting a divine or heavenly setting, with decorative arches and microarchitecture.",
