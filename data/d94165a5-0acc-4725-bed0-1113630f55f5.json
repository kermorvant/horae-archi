    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Archangel Michael, identifiable by his halo and wings, standing over a defeated dragon or demon. He holds a cross-staff in his right hand, which he appears to be using to pierce the creature. A scroll is visible near his left hand. The background is a dark, decorative pattern of foliage. The figure is rendered in a stylized, somewhat naive manner typical of some medieval illuminations, with a halo and flowing drapery. The dragon is depicted with claws and a reptilian head, struggling beneath the angel's feet. The overall impression is one of divine victory over evil.",
