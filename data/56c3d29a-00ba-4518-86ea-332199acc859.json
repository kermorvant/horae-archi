    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, crowned and holding the Christ Child, who is reaching out. They are surrounded by three winged figures, likely angels, one of whom holds a scroll with musical notation. To the right, a kneeling woman in a dark, fur-lined robe with a gold necklace and red-dotted sleeves gestures with clasped hands. Behind them, an arched architectural structure frames a view of a building with a patterned roof and a courtyard with a fence and greenery. The overall setting suggests a devotional or religious gathering, possibly within a courtyard or garden adjacent to a building.",
