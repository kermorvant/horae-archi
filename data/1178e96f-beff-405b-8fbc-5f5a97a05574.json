    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Agony in the Garden. In the foreground, three disciples are asleep: one with a sword resting beside him, another with his head on a book, and a third with his head bowed. In the middle ground, Christ is shown kneeling in prayer, with his hands clasped and his gaze directed upwards. Behind him, a group of soldiers approaches through a wooden fence and a gatehouse. In the upper right, an angel descends from a golden sky, holding a cross, symbolizing Christ's impending sacrifice. The setting is a rocky, green landscape under a blue sky with stylized clouds.",
