    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and holding a book and a palm frond, stands in the foreground. She is dressed in a flowing white robe with gold trim. To her right, a circular tower with decorative bands and small figures in niches is visible, suggesting a religious or civic structure. In the background, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills, stylized trees, and distant castles or fortified buildings. The overall scene is rendered with delicate brushwork and gold accents, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
