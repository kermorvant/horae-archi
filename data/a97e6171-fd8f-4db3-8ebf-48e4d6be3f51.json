She wears a mantle over a patterned tunic and a diadem. The background is filled with a dotted pattern, suggesting a stylized interior or a symbolic space. Above her, an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative tracery frames the scene. The presence of the book and sword are common attributes of saints, particularly martyrs.",
