    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a hermit or penitent, sits on a stool warming their hands by a fire burning within a stone structure. The figure wears an orange robe and a blue hood, with bare feet. The background features a decorative pattern of gold swirls on a pink ground, framed by a blue arch and a border adorned with red and gold floral motifs. The scene is set outdoors on a grassy area with sparse yellow foliage. The fire appears to be contained within a hearth or brazier, suggesting a domestic or monastic setting for warmth.",
