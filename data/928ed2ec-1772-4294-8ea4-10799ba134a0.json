    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious service within an architectural setting that suggests a church or chapel. In the foreground, a priest in a blue and gold chasuble stands before an altar, his hands clasped in prayer. To his left, a young acolyte in a white alb with red trim observes. Behind the altar, a group of clerics, likely monks or canons, are gathered around a lectern, reading from books. To the right, a woman in a red gown and headdress holds a book, and behind her, another woman in blue stands. A small white dog rests on the green floor. The background features an arched arcade with red, star-patterned vaults, and tall, mullioned windows with tracery. On the far left, a statue or image of the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child is visible on a pedestal, next to a lit candle and liturgical vessels.",
