    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, seated on a donkey, cradles the Christ Child. Saint Joseph, holding a staff, walks beside the donkey, guiding it. To the right, an angel with folded arms observes the scene, with a lush, leafy background suggesting an outdoor setting. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sacred status. The overall composition suggests a moment of peaceful travel and divine protection.",
