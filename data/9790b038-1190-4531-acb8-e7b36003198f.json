    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a young man, reclining and resting his head on his hand, appearing to be asleep or in deep thought. He is dressed in a tunic and trousers. To his left, a stylized tree trunk is visible, and behind him, a large, feathered wing suggests the presence of an angel. The ground is rendered with textured lines, indicating a natural, outdoor setting. The overall impression is one of peaceful repose, possibly a moment of divine inspiration or a dream.",
