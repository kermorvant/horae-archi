    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Entombment of Christ. Christ's body, marked with wounds, lies on a stone sarcophagus. The Virgin Mary, veiled in blue, mourns beside him, supported by Saint John the Evangelist. Joseph of Arimathea, wearing a blue hat and yellow cloak, supports Christ's head. Another figure in red holds a golden vessel, possibly for anointing. A figure in a striped robe kneels, attending to the body, while another in red, also with a hat, prepares to wrap the body. The background features a rocky landscape and a distant city with spires, suggesting the event takes place outside the city walls.",
