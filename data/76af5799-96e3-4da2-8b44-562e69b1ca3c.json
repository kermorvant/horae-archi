    "scene_description_enriched": "A skeletal figure, personifying Death, strikes a woman in the chest with a spear. The woman, dressed in a long red and gold gown and a blue veil, recoils in surprise and pain, her mouth agape. Behind them, a stylized landscape unfolds with green trees and distant blue buildings, suggesting an urban or semi-urban setting. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element with decorative columns.",
