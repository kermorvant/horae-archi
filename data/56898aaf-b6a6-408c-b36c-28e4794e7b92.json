    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two parts by a dark vertical element, likely a column or frame. On the left, a group of figures are gathered around a table. A woman in a blue robe and white veil holds a swaddled infant, identified by a halo as Christ Child. She is flanked by other figures, including a woman in a red robe and green headdress, and a man in a blue robe and red hat. The text above them reads \"Cest le iour bebe\" (This is the baby day). On the right, a man identified as \"ZAKARIAS\" stands with his hands clasped in prayer before a golden lectern. He wears a blue robe and a red, conical hat. The background on the left depicts an interior space with arched windows and wooden beams. The background on the right shows a similar interior with a large circular motif, possibly a window or decorative element, and a scroll with text. The overall scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, with Zacharias on the right likely representing his role in the temple.",
