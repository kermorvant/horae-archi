    "scene_description_enriched": "A knight in full armor, bearing a red cross on a white surcoat, rides a horse and raises his sword to strike a dragon. The dragon, with blue head and wings, appears to be wounded. In the background, a castle with towers and walls stands on a hill. To the right, a woman in a pink gown kneels beside a lamb, looking towards the knight. The scene is set in a landscape with trees and distant buildings, suggesting an outdoor setting for this chivalric and devotional narrative.",
