    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle over a red tunic and a golden halo, kneels in prayer or contemplation. Before her, nestled in a straw manger, lies the Christ Child, also with a golden halo. Behind them stands Joseph, dressed in a red robe with gold trim, holding a lantern and a staff. They are positioned within a ruined architectural structure, suggested by crumbling brick walls, an arched opening, and a broken semi-circular pediment. Through the arch, a desolate landscape with mountains is visible. To the right, within the ruins, are the heads of a cow and an ox. The scene is framed by ornate golden architectural elements and red drapery.",
