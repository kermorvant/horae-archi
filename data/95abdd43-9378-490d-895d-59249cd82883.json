    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Lawrence, who is shown immersed in a large cauldron over a fire. He has his hands clasped in prayer and a halo signifies his sainthood. Around him, a crowd of onlookers expresses various emotions, from distress to curiosity. To the left, a figure in a red tunic and blue hose recoils in horror, shielding his eyes. To the right, a woman in a purple robe and blue headdress looks up at the saint, holding a mirror. In the background, a fortified castle with towers and battlements is visible, set against a green landscape and a blue sky. The overall scene is one of suffering and divine witness, set within a semi-urban or semi-rural environment.",
