    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered under a decorative architectural archway. In the center, a woman veiled in blue and wearing a red gown stands with her hands raised, bathed in golden light emanating from a dove descending from above, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. Surrounding her are several bearded men, some looking towards her, others with their gaze directed elsewhere. The architectural setting is ornate, with a red and gold patterned arch and columns. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern. This scene represents the Pentecost, where the Holy Spirit descended upon the Virgin Mary and the Apostles, empowering them to spread the Christian message.",
