    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. A figure, likely the executioner, stands over a kneeling woman whose head has been severed and is shown separately with a halo. Blood and water gush from the wound. The executioner holds a sword and is positioned near a large wooden wheel, a symbol of her torture. In the background, several figures, including two crowned individuals and others in robes, observe the event. A distant city with towers is visible on a hill. The scene is set in a landscape with green hills and scattered foliage, under a bright blue sky with rays of golden light descending from above.",
