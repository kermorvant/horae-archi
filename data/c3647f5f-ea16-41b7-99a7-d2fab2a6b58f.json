    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude child, likely representing the astrological sign Aquarius, is depicted pouring water from a spherical vessel. The child's body is rendered in pale tones with subtle shading. The background features a stylized landscape with rolling green hills, rocky outcrops, and a blue sky with distant mountains. The scene is framed by a decorative gold border, suggesting it is part of a manuscript illumination. The act of pouring water from a vessel is a direct visual representation of the Aquarius zodiac sign.",
