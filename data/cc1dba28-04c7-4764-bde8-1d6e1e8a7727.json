    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a landscape setting with a red, star-filled sky. In the upper register, two elderly men with halos are shown looking upwards, one holding a book. Below them, rays of golden light descend. In the middle ground, a naked figure, likely Adam, is being touched by a man in a blue robe, while another figure in a blue robe stands behind. To the left, a bearded man with a halo in a blue robe gestures upwards. In the foreground, a man in a red robe lies on the ground, seemingly struck down, and a monstrous, wolf-like creature with sharp teeth and claws is present on the right. The overall composition suggests a divine intervention or judgment.",
