The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, lies on an orange bed, her head resting on her hand, looking towards the Christ Child. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is in a manger made of woven material, with a donkey and an ox looking on. To the left, a bearded man, likely Joseph, wearing a green turban and a blue robe, sits on a wooden stool, his hands clasped. The background is a patterned blue tapestry, and the foreground is a green grassy area. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
