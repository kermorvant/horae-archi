    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, stands on the left, holding a golden chalice containing a dark object, possibly a bird or a demon. The figure wears a pink robe over a yellow garment. To the right, a kneeling man in a blue robe adorned with gold embroidery prays before a book placed on a table draped with a blue and green cloth decorated with keys. The background features an architectural setting with arched openings and columns, suggesting an interior space. The floor is tiled with a black and white geometric pattern. The scene is framed by an illuminated border.",
