    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts agricultural labor in a rural landscape. In the foreground, a man wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a white apron over a tunic is sowing seeds, scattering them from a pouch held over his shoulder. His legs are clad in patterned hose. To his left, another figure, partially obscured by a cart-like structure, is also engaged in sowing or tending to the field. Further to the right, a third figure is seated, possibly gathering or sowing seeds, with a basket in front of them. The background features rolling hills and trees under a blue sky. This scene likely represents the agricultural cycle, possibly alluding to the parable of the Sower, which emphasizes the importance of receptive hearts for the \"seed\" of God's word to bear fruit.",
