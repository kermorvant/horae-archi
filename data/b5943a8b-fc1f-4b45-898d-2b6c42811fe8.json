    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated on a throne, holding the Christ Child. She is dressed in a blue robe with gold trim. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is reaching out. To the left, a woman in a pink gown with a red belt and orange head covering kneels before a green-covered table with an open book. The background features a dark, patterned wall and an orange canopy above the throne. The overall setting appears to be an interior space, possibly a chamber or a chapel, suggested by the architectural elements and the enclosed nature of the scene.",
