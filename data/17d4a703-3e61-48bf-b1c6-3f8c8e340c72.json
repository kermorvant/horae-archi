He is holding a piece of bread in his right hand and appears to be breaking it. On the table are a jug, a cup, pieces of bread, and a knife. The background is a decorative tapestry with a repeating pattern of blue and orange squares. The man's legs are visible beneath the table, clad in blue trousers and dark shoes, and a fire burns at his feet.",
