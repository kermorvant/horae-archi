    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bearded male figure, likely a saint, standing within an arched architectural frame. He holds an open book in his left hand and a staff or crosier in his right. To his left, another bearded figure is partially visible, also holding a book. At the feet of the main figure, a horned creature, possibly a demon or a symbolic representation of evil, is depicted. The background suggests an interior architectural setting with decorative elements and what appears to be a column or pillar. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong linework.",
