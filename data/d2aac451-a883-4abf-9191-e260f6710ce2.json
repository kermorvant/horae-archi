    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, wearing a crown of thorns and a blue and gold robe, carrying a large wooden cross. He is shown from the chest up, with his head bowed in exertion. To his left, a man with a white beard and hair, possibly Simon of Cyrene, also grips the cross. Behind Christ, two women are visible: one with auburn hair and a golden robe, and another, the Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and white veil, her hands clasped in sorrow. The background is a stylized representation of a body of water with vertical lines suggesting rain or spears, and a grey architectural structure with arched openings.",
