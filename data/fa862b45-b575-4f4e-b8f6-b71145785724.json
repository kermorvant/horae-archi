    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a frieze-like composition with four figures framed by architectural elements. On the left, a bearded man in a hooded garment looks upwards. Next to him, a crowned figure, likely a king, is engaged in conversation with another bearded man wearing a cap and a tunic. Between these two figures and the next column, a small building with a tower is visible. To the right, another bearded man in a draped garment gestures with his hand. The scene is set within an architectural framework suggesting an interior or a stylized representation of a space, possibly a courtyard or a loggia, with columns and arches.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene does not depict a specific biblical or devotional event that can be definitively identified from the visual cues alone. The presence of a crowned figure might suggest a royal or historical narrative, but without further context, a precise interpretation is not possible.",
