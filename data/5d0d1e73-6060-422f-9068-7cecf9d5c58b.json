    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, with the Virgin Mary riding a donkey and holding the Christ Child. Joseph walks beside them, carrying a staff over his shoulder. In the background, a fortified town with towers and buildings is visible, nestled amongst rolling green hills and trees. The figures are rendered in a stylized manner, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination, with the Virgin Mary cloaked in blue and Joseph wearing a cap and a reddish-orange cloak over a grey tunic. The overall impression is one of humble travel and protection.",
