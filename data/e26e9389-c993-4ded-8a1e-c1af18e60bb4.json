    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a young man, likely a saint, with a tonsured haircut and a halo, shown in profile with his eyes closed in prayer or contemplation. He wears a richly patterned brown garment over a pink tunic. He holds a tool, possibly a gridiron, a symbol of martyrdom, in his hands. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling green hills, trees, and a blue sky. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling a golden archway with decorative scrollwork, suggesting a devotional setting. Below the figure, a band of text in Gothic script is visible, likely identifying the saint.",
