    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king, seated on an ornate throne, listens intently to a bearded man in a turban and flowing robes who gestures with his right hand. The king wears a blue mantle over a golden tunic and has his left hand resting on his lap. The man, with a long white beard, is dressed in a pink robe over a golden undergarment. Behind them, a lush green landscape with trees and rolling hills unfolds under a bright blue sky. The throne is intricately carved with Gothic tracery and topped with decorative pinnacles. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with elements of architecture framing the figures.",
