    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a sky filled with billowing clouds from which rain is falling. A sun, partially obscured by clouds, is visible in the upper left. The entire scene is contained within an oval frame, bordered by a gold band inscribed with Latin text. The text reads: \"ARDOREM EXTINGVCTA TESTANTVR VIVERE FLAMMA\". This translates to: \"The extinguished flame testifies to the burning desire.\" The overall impression is one of a celestial or atmospheric event, possibly symbolic.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a symbolic or allegorical concept rather than a specific biblical event. The inscription \"The extinguished flame testifies to the burning desire\" suggests themes of passion, longing, or perhaps divine intervention that quenches earthly desires. In a devotional context, this could relate to the quenching of sin or the fulfillment of spiritual yearning.",
