    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony, likely a baptism, taking place within a richly decorated architectural setting. Several figures are gathered around a baptismal font. On the left, a woman in a blue mantle and veil, with hands clasped in prayer, stands next to a man in a red and brown robe. To the right of the font, an older man with a beard, wearing a patterned robe, holds a swaddled infant. Behind him, a woman in a black veil and red garment looks on. Another figure in a blue and orange hat stands to the far right. The background features columns, arches, and a detailed window, suggesting an interior space within a religious building. A golden reliquary or tabernacle is visible in the background, further emphasizing the sacred nature of the event.",
