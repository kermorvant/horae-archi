    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border featuring stylized floral motifs, leaves, and zoomorphic elements, possibly a griffin or a bird-like creature. Interspersed within the foliage are depictions of human figures, one of whom appears to be a man with a beard, wearing a tunic and with his arms crossed. Another figure, also with a beard, is shown in profile, with his hands clasped. The overall impression is one of intricate ornamentation, likely serving as an initial or a decorative frame for text within a manuscript.",
