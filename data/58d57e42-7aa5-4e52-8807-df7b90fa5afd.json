    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central, cylindrical altar or brazier, rendered in grey stone with vertical fluting and layered base. From this altar erupts a large, vibrant flame. Flanking the central structure are two smaller, basket-like containers also filled with flames. Above the altar, a golden, open-air pavilion is supported by four twisted columns. The pavilion's roof is decorated with a series of small, rounded arches. The background is a dark, speckled void, suggesting a non-terrestrial setting. The entire composition is framed by a golden, scalloped border.",
