    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral landscape, three shepherds are depicted looking upwards in awe. One shepherd, standing with a staff, gestures towards the sky. Another shepherd, seated, has their hands clasped in prayer or supplication, while a third, also seated and hooded, looks up with an open mouth. A flock of sheep is visible behind a wooden fence, and in the distance, a small village with a tower and houses can be seen. Above them, a dark cloud descends, from which emerge several winged figures, identified as angels, holding a scroll inscribed with musical notation and the word 'GLORIA'. The scene is interpreted as the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a pivotal moment in the Nativity narrative where angels announce the birth of Christ to humble shepherds.",
