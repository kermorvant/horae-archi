    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated on a green cushion, holds the Christ Child on her lap. She wears a blue robe over a golden tunic and has a halo. Before her, one of the Magi kneels, offering a golden chalice, while another stands, holding a similar vessel. A third figure, also richly attired, stands to the left, holding a staff. To the right, an older man with a beard, possibly a shepherd, leans on a staff. In the background, a simple building with a thatched roof and wooden beams is visible, and beyond that, a fortified castle sits atop a hill, with a river and figures on horseback in the middle ground. A greyhound is depicted in the foreground.",
