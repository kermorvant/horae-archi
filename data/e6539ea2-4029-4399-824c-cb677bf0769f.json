    "scene_description_enriched": "Two winged figures, identified as angels by their halos, are depicted kneeling and reverently touching a wooden cross. The angel on the left wears a purple robe with gold embellishments, while the angel on the right is clad in a red robe, also with gold accents. Both angels have auburn hair and are shown with their hands extended towards the cross. Above the cross, a small plaque displays the inscription \"INRI\". The background features a landscape with rolling green hills, scattered trees, and distant architectural structures that appear to be castles or fortified buildings. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
