In the foreground, five figures in dark, hooded monastic robes are seated, facing away from the viewer. In the middle ground, a red-draped structure, possibly an altar or a tomb, is adorned with a blue band featuring white crosses. Behind this, three figures in white clerical garments stand. One holds a book, another a processional cross, and the third gestures. The background features a patterned red tapestry and a blue-grey wall with a window. The scene is framed by an arched structure and decorative borders.",
