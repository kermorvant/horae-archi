    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pregnant woman, possibly Bathsheba, standing before a crowned king, likely King David, who is seated on a throne. The woman is partially undressed, revealing her pregnant belly, and holds a piece of cloth. The king, adorned with a crown and royal robes, holds a scepter and appears to be gesturing towards her. The background suggests an interior setting with architectural elements like a window with tracery and decorative hangings. A dog is visible sleeping at the king's feet. The overall composition suggests a narrative moment of royal summons or judgment.",
