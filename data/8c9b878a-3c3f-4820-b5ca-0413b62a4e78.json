    "scene_description_enriched": "A stag with prominent antlers is depicted lying down in a landscape. The stag is a reddish-brown color and appears to be resting. The background features a blue sky with sparse, leafless trees and rolling hills. In the foreground, there are small, dark shapes scattered on the ground, possibly representing pebbles or fallen leaves, and a blue, watery element that could be a stream or pond. The entire scene is framed by an illuminated border with red and blue circular motifs and intricate gold patterns. This imagery likely symbolizes the hart panting for the water brooks, a common motif in devotional texts, particularly referencing Psalm 42:1, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.\"",
