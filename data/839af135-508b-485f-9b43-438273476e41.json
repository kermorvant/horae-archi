    "scene_description_enriched": "A half-length portrait of a young person with long, wavy blonde hair and a halo, depicted in a three-quarter profile. The figure wears a reddish-brown robe over a purple garment and holds a golden chalice containing green stems in their left hand. The right hand is raised, with the index finger extended. The background features a blue sky and a distant landscape with rolling hills and a city or castle on a hill. The overall impression is one of serene contemplation or blessing, likely representing a saint associated with a chalice.",
