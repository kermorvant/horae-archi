    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ within a stylized architectural setting. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, cradles the swaddled Christ Child. To the right, an older man, likely Joseph, with a halo, reaches out towards them with open hands. In the lower left, a manger is visible, with a cow and a donkey present. The background is a rich blue fabric with a gold diamond pattern, and above, a canopy is suggested by draped fabric and a chain-like element. The overall composition is framed by a decorative border.",
