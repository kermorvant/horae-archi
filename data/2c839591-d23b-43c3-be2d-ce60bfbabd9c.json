    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King David, identifiable by the inscription \"David\" and his regal attire, standing with a staff and looking upwards. He is accompanied by a green dragon-like creature. In the background, a celestial scene unfolds with a sun and stars, and two angels, one in yellow and one in pink, are shown in flight. Below them, birds and stones are depicted. To the right, a group of people, including a man kneeling in prayer and two women, observe the scene, alongside a donkey and a cow. The overall composition suggests a narrative of divine intervention or a miraculous event, possibly related to King David's faith or a victory over evil, symbolized by the dragon.",
