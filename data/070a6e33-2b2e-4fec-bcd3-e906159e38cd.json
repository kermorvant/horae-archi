    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a landscape setting with architectural ruins. In the foreground, a man with a long white beard and hair, partially undressed and wrapped in a white cloth, kneels with his arms crossed. To his right, a man in a blue robe and yellow hat gestures with his finger, while another figure in a yellow robe looks on. Behind them, a woman with her hands clasped in prayer stands looking down. In the background, crumbling stone structures suggest ruins, possibly a castle or fortified building, against a blue sky with distant mountains. The overall impression is one of a somber encounter, possibly a moment of spiritual counsel or visitation.",
