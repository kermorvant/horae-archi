    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Sebastian, a young man with a halo, tied to a tree and pierced by multiple arrows. His body is marked with wounds from which blood flows. He is clad only in a white loincloth. The background shows a lush green landscape with trees and bushes, and in the distance, a city with towers and spires. To the right of the saint, a fragment of what appears to be a stone archway or ruin is visible. The entire scene is framed by a decorative border with gold accents.",
