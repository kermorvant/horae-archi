    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a long, wavy beard and hair, wearing a hat adorned with a flower, stands in a room. He is dressed in a long robe with decorative elements on the chest and a sash around his waist. He holds a whip or flail in his left hand, with the tip pointing upwards, and a set of keys hangs from his right hip. Behind him, a window with diamond-shaped panes is visible. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style, with strong linework and hatching to create shading and texture.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a figure associated with authority or judgment, possibly a representation of a judge, a jailer, or even a symbolic figure like Saint Peter holding the keys to heaven, or a figure from the Old Testament. The whip could symbolize punishment or control, while the keys represent access or authority. Without further context, a definitive interpretation is difficult, but it suggests a role of power and responsibility.",
