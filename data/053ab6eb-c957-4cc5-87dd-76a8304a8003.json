    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a halo and wearing a blue mantle over a white garment, stands and holds up a white cloth. On the cloth is the imprint of a man's face with long brown hair and a beard, wearing a crown. The background is a golden, textured wall, and the scene is framed by green drapery on the left and architectural elements on the right, suggesting an interior setting. The floor is tiled in a golden pattern. This scene likely represents the Veil of Veronica, a relic bearing the imprint of Christ's face.",
