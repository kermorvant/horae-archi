    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic jumble of figures, seemingly in distress or mourning, lying down and reaching out. Their faces are etched with sorrow and exhaustion. In the upper left corner, a fragment of a building with a pointed arch and a small niche is visible, suggesting an architectural context. The overall impression is one of suffering and perhaps a depiction of a plague or a scene of death and resurrection.",
