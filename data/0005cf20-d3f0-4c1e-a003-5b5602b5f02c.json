    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Sebastian, a young man with his hands raised above his head, pierced by multiple arrows. He stands unclothed except for a loincloth. To his left, an archer, dressed in a tunic and hose, draws a bow, aiming another arrow at the saint. The setting is an outdoor landscape with trees in the background and a rocky, uneven ground. This iconography represents the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, a Roman soldier who was condemned to be shot to death with arrows by order of Emperor Diocletian.",
