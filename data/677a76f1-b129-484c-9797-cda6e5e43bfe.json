    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures on horseback, arranged in a vertical procession. The foremost figure, a man with curly hair and armor, rides a horse that is galloping forward. Behind him, a second figure, also on horseback, wears a helmet and appears to be holding reins. The uppermost figure, a bearded man with a crown, rides a horse and draws a bow, aiming an arrow upwards. He holds a sword in his other hand. The background is filled with stylized clouds and decorative elements. This imagery is likely a representation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, specifically the horsemen of Conquest (with a bow), War (with a sword), and potentially Famine or Pestilence, though only three figures are clearly depicted.",
