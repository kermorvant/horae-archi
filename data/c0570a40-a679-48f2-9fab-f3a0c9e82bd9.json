    "scene_description_enriched": "Four women, each wearing a veil and a long robe, are depicted in close proximity. The woman on the far left has her hands clasped at her waist. The second woman from the left has her hands together in prayer. The third woman from the left is also shown with her hands together in prayer, and the fourth woman on the far right has her arms crossed, with her hands resting on her forearms. The figures are rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching to indicate folds in the fabric and facial features. No architectural elements or specific setting are visible, suggesting a focus on the figures themselves.",
