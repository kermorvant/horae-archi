    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child on his shoulders. Saint Christopher, a bearded man with long hair, wears a simple tunic and a headband. He holds a tall staff in his left hand and his right arm is bent, supporting the child. The Christ Child, depicted as a young boy with a halo, is seated on Saint Christopher's shoulders, holding a globe surmounted by a cross in his left hand and raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing. They are framed by an arched architectural element, possibly representing a portal or a decorative canopy, with a dotted background suggesting a stylized sky or a decorative motif. The overall style is that of a woodcut or wood engraving, common in medieval manuscripts.",
