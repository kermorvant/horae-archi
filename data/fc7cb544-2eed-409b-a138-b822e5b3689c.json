    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, a bull is depicted lying down. The bull faces left, with its head turned slightly towards the viewer. Its body is rendered in a somewhat stylized manner, with visible legs tucked beneath it. The background within the circle is filled with a geometric pattern of intersecting lines, forming diamond shapes and crosses. The entire scene is surrounded by decorative elements, including small circles and organic, leaf-like forms, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript page.",
