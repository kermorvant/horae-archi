    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands on the right, gesturing with his right hand. He is dressed in a pink undergarment and a blue cope adorned with gold embroidery. To the left, three nude children are depicted in a basket-like structure, their hands clasped in prayer. The background suggests an interior setting with dark, wooden architectural elements behind the children, and a blue, possibly curtained, backdrop behind the bishop. The scene likely depicts a saintly intervention or a miracle involving children.",
