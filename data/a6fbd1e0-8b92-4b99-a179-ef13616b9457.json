    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a wedding ceremony presided over by a bishop. A bearded man, presumably the groom, is placing a ring on the finger of a woman, the bride, who is kneeling. Both are dressed in rich garments. The bishop, wearing a mitre and a red and gold cope, stands between them, his hands raised in blessing or prayer. A group of onlookers, dressed in various colored tunics and hats, are gathered around the central figures. The setting appears to be indoors, with a plain grey wall behind the figures and a patterned floor. The scene is framed by an ornate border with floral motifs.",
