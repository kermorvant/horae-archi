    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a halo, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before an open book resting on a red draped table. She wears a blue robe with gold trim. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, also with a halo and wings, is seated, holding a golden staff and gesturing with his raised index finger. He wears a golden robe. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The background features classical columns and an arch, suggesting an interior space, possibly a room or a loggia.",
