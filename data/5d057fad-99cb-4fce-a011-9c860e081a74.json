    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus in the center on the cross, flanked by two thieves. Below, the Virgin Mary stands to the left, draped in a blue mantle, with a halo. To her right, a kneeling figure in a red robe and blue tunic gazes upwards, also with a halo. On the right, a figure in a yellow tunic and red mantle raises their hands in supplication, with a halo. The background features a dark, cloudy sky, a distant landscape with rolling hills, and a city with prominent buildings, including what appears to be a temple or basilica with columns and a dome, and other structures with spires and walls. The ground is rocky and sparsely vegetated.",
