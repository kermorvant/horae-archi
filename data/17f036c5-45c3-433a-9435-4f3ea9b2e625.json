    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, is seated on a raised platform, holding the Christ Child. Three Magi, identifiable by their crowns and gifts, approach them. One Magus, kneeling in the foreground, offers a vessel. Two other Magi stand behind him, one holding a flask and the other a golden vessel. Behind the figures, a simple wooden stable structure is visible, along with rocky terrain and stylized trees. The background features a patterned textile, suggesting an indoor or decorated setting. The overall composition conveys the reverence and homage paid to the newborn King.",
