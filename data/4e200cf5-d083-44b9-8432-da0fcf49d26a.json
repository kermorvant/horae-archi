    "scene_description_enriched": "A man in a red cap and dark tunic with gold trim raises a sword above his head, poised to strike a kneeling woman. The woman, wearing a blue robe over a white garment and a red head covering, has her hands clasped in prayer. The background is a vibrant blue sky dotted with gold specks, suggesting a celestial or divine setting, with a hint of a landscape with trees and water in the distance. To the right, a golden object, possibly an altar or a reliquary, is partially visible. The scene depicts a martyrdom, likely Saint Catherine of Alexandria, being beheaded.",
