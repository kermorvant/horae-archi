    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king, identifiable by his crown and regal attire, standing in a landscape with stylized flowers and grass. He is raising his right hand, from which rays of light emanate, towards a group of figures in the upper left. These figures appear to be a congregation of people, some with halos, suggesting they are saints or blessed souls. To the lower left, a chaotic scene unfolds with numerous demonic figures tormenting fallen human souls, some of whom are depicted as infants. The king's gesture and the surrounding imagery suggest a divine intervention or a moment of judgment. A scroll with text is visible to the right of the king's head.",
