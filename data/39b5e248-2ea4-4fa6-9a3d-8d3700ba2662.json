    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, with the Virgin Mary seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child. Saint Joseph walks beside them, guiding the donkey. The background features a rolling landscape with trees and a river. In the distance, a fortified city with towers and battlements is visible, under a radiant sun. The upper part of the image shows a stylized representation of the sun with golden rays emanating downwards. The lower part of the scene includes a river with figures fishing and a windmill on a hill. The overall impression is one of a sacred journey through a somewhat idealized medieval landscape.",
