    "scene_description_enriched": "This image depicts a decorative border featuring stylized animalistic motifs. On the left and right ends are creatures resembling dogs or wolves, with pointed ears and open mouths. In the center is a lion's head, characterized by a mane and wide eyes, flanked by decorative scrollwork and circular elements. The overall impression is one of a decorative frieze or initial, likely intended to adorn a manuscript page.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This is a decorative border, not a narrative scene with religious or biblical meaning. The animal motifs, particularly the lion, can sometimes carry symbolic weight in medieval art (e.g., representing Christ or power), but without a specific context or accompanying figures, it's primarily ornamental.",
