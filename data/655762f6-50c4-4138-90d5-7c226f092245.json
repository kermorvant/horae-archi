    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary seated at a desk, reading from a book. An angel, dressed in a red robe and with blue wings, approaches her from the left, with hands clasped in prayer and a scroll emerging from its mouth. Rays of golden light descend from the upper left, illuminating the scene. The figures are set against an architectural backdrop that includes columns and a window, with a landscape visible in the background. The Virgin Mary is depicted with a halo, signifying her sanctity, and her gesture of placing a hand on her chest suggests contemplation or acceptance.",
