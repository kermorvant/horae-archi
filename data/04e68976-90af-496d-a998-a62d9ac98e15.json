    "scene_description_enriched": "A winged lion-like creature with orange wings stands to the left of a man seated on the right. The man, dressed in a red tunic and blue trousers, wears a hat and is writing on a scroll. He is seated on a green carpeted floor. Behind the figures, a blue curtain hangs, and to the left, a brown structure with an opening suggests an interior space. The winged creature has a serpent coiled around its body and extending towards the man's hand. This scene likely depicts Saint Mark the Evangelist, traditionally associated with a winged lion, writing his Gospel, possibly with the assistance or inspiration of his symbolic animal.",
