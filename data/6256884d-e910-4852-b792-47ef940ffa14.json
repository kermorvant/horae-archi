    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. A wooden structure with a thatched roof shelters the newborn Christ Child, who lies on a red, patterned cloth. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and with a halo, kneels in prayer before the child. To her right, an older man, likely Saint Joseph, also kneels with clasped hands. Above them, a white ox and a brown bull look on. In the background, a stylized fence encloses the stable area, beyond which a lush green tree stands. Further in the distance, a cityscape with prominent spires and towers is visible under a radiant blue sky from which golden rays emanate, symbolizing divine light. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative floral motifs.",
