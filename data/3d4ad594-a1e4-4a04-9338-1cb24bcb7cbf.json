    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two shepherds in a pastoral landscape, with a flock of sheep grazing behind them and a dog in the foreground. Above them, in a golden halo, an angel with wings is shown, gesturing downwards. The shepherds are dressed in medieval attire, one in a red tunic and blue mantle, the other in a blue tunic and red hood. They hold staffs, suggesting their role as shepherds. In the background, simple buildings with thatched roofs are visible, indicating a rural setting. The angel's presence and gesture suggest a divine message or intervention, likely related to the shepherds, hinting at the Annunciation to the Shepherds.",
