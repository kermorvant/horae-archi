    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in monastic habits kneeling in a grassy, hilly landscape. The foreground figure, facing away from the viewer and looking upwards, has a halo and is praying with clasped hands. Above this figure, a small, colorful bird with outstretched wings is depicted in flight. In the background, a second figure in a hooded habit is also kneeling, facing away. The landscape includes sparse trees and a distant view of buildings, possibly a town or village, under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The overall impression is one of devotion and spiritual contemplation in an outdoor setting.",
