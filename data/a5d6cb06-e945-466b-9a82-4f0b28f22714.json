    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two male figures framed by an ornate, golden architectural structure. The figure on the right, bearded and wearing a red tunic and a blue mantle, holds a long staff. The figure on the left, younger and beardless, wears a yellow and orange garment and carries a palm frond. They stand in a landscape with green foliage and a blue sky. The architectural frame features decorative elements and inscriptions, including \"SIMON ET\" and \"PIVOE\" (likely part of a longer inscription). The overall impression is of a devotional image, possibly representing saints or apostles.",
