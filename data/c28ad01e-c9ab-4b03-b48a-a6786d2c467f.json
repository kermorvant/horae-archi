    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a domestic interior, likely a bedroom, where a woman lies in bed, seemingly ill or in the process of dying, with her hands clasped in prayer. Several figures surround her: a priest or cleric holding a crucifix and a book, a child, and a monk also holding a book. In the foreground, three women in elaborate golden gowns are kneeling and praying, two of whom are reading from open books. A dog lies attentively in the lower right corner. The room is richly decorated with red drapery, a patterned floor, and wooden architectural elements. A framed image of the Crucifixion hangs on the wall, and a window shows a scene of hell or purgatory. The overall atmosphere suggests a moment of spiritual contemplation and prayer during a time of crisis or transition.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Last Rites or a prayer for the dying, emphasizing themes of salvation, judgment, and divine mercy. The presence of the priest, the crucifix, and the depiction of hell in the window all point to the spiritual anxieties and devotional practices surrounding death in the medieval period. The praying figures and the reading of scripture highlight the importance of faith and intercession for the soul's journey.",
