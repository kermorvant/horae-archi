    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine intervention from a cloud, from which a hand emerges, bestowing a blessing or decree. Below, two prominent figures, likely kings or important individuals, are shown in prayer or supplication. One, adorned with a crown, wears a golden robe and a blue mantle, while the other, with a long white beard, is dressed in a blue robe patterned with dark blue flowers. They stand on a grassy ground, with two other figures in green robes behind them. In the foreground, two animals, possibly sheep or lambs, lie on the ground, one appearing to be sacrificed or presented. The background features a rich red tapestry with intricate gold swirling patterns and a blue celestial band with golden stars above.",
