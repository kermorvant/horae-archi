    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identified by his halo, standing in a landscape. He is dressed in a purple robe and appears to be interacting with a group of figures. To his left, a partially nude female figure, possibly Mary Magdalene, is kneeling and holding a bouquet of flowers. Behind Christ, several men are gathered, some with halos, suggesting they are important figures or saints. One man in a blue robe and a red belt gestures towards Christ, while another in a red garment stands behind him. The background features rolling green hills and a blue sky. The overall setting is outdoors, with a sense of natural environment.",
