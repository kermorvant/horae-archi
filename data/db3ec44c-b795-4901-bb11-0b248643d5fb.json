Mary, dressed in a vibrant blue mantle, cradles the infant who is reaching up towards her face. Both figures have golden halos, indicating their divine status. The background is framed by a large, decorative initial 'H' in blue and gold, with a red and gold wavy pattern behind the figures. The overall impression is one of maternal love and divine connection.",
