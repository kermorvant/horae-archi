    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three nude figures in a dark, earthy setting, possibly a tomb or a cave. In the foreground, a male figure reclines with his head tilted back, looking upwards. To his right and slightly behind him, a female figure sits with her arms raised towards the sky, her face also looking upwards. To the far right, a third figure, possibly male, is partially visible, also looking upwards. The overall impression is one of supplication or awe.",
