    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, dressed in a red robe and with large green wings, pointing towards the Virgin Mary on the right. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle over a dark dress, holds a book and has her arms crossed over her chest, looking downwards with a pensive expression. Above them, a white dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that appears to be an interior space with a tiled floor and a dark, decorated wall or screen behind them. The overall composition is framed by a decorative border typical of Books of Hours.",
