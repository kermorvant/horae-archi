    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a scene with two figures. On the left, a person with a beard and a hooded garment raises their right hand to their face, with their left arm bent. Their expression appears distressed or contemplative. To the right, another figure is shown in a kneeling or prostrate position, with their back to the viewer, their arms bent and hands clasped or resting on the ground. The figures are surrounded by decorative, swirling vegetal or abstract motifs, suggesting a stylized or symbolic setting rather than a realistic one. There is no discernible architecture.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of prayer, supplication, or lamentation. The raised hand and distressed expression of the figure on the left, combined with the posture of the figure on the right, are common visual cues for such emotions and actions in medieval art. Without further context, a specific biblical or devotional event cannot be definitively identified, but it aligns with themes of penitence or seeking divine intervention.",
