    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of twelve figures gathered together, with a dove descending from above, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The figures, all with golden halos, are arranged in a semi-circle, with one central female figure in blue, reading from an open book. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of gold and blue, framed by an ornate border. The figures' expressions are varied, some looking upwards, others inwards, and one is kneeling. This scene represents the Pentecost, the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and Mary.",
