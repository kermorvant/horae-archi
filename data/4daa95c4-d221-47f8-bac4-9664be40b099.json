    "scene_description_enriched": "A royal figure, likely King David, is seated on a throne adorned with a crown and a richly patterned blue robe. He is surrounded by several attendants. To his left stands a bearded man in a red robe and a red cap, accompanied by another man in a blue tunic. To his right, two men stand, one wearing a blue and grey garment and a red cap, and the other in a pinkish tunic and hat. The scene takes place indoors, within a hall or chamber, indicated by the presence of columns, a window with diamond-shaped panes, and a patterned carpet. A harp is visible on the carpet in the foreground, alluding to David's musical talents.",
