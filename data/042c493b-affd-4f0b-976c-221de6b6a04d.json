    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a formal gathering, likely a wedding ceremony, with a central figure in a bishop's mitre officiating. To his left stands a woman with long flowing hair and a headdress, and to his right, a man with a similar headdress. Their hands are clasped together, suggesting a union. Several other faces are visible in the background, observing the event. The architectural setting is suggested by decorative elements at the top, including what appears to be a stylized building with a pointed arch and a small tower or pinnacle, implying an ecclesiastical or noble context.",
