    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a group of figures in what appears to be an indoor setting, though architectural details are minimal. Two figures in the foreground are prominently displayed, one with arms crossed and the other with hands clasped in prayer or supplication. Behind them, several other individuals are visible, some with hands raised in a similar gesture. The figures are dressed in simple tunics, and their faces are rendered with expressive lines. The overall impression is one of a gathering or a scene of communal interaction, possibly involving prayer or discussion.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too generalized to definitively interpret a specific religious or biblical event. However, the gesture of clasped hands suggests prayer, supplication, or devotion, which are common themes in Books of Hours. Without further context or identifying attributes, it is difficult to assign a precise interpretation.",
