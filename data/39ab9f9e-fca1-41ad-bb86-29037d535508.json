    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral procession or a religious ceremony outdoors. A group of clerics, some in blue and gold vestments and others in black habits, are gathered, holding an open book and singing. One cleric carries a censer. In the foreground, two figures are tending to a deceased person wrapped in a white shroud, lying on the ground. Behind them, a young acolyte in a white robe holds a lantern and stands near a processional cross. In the background, there is a building with arched windows and a pitched roof, suggesting a church or monastery, and a cross with a golden halo. The sky is a vibrant blue with rays of light emanating from above.",
