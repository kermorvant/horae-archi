    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts two figures within a quatrefoil frame, set against a background of faded gold and green. On the left, a figure appears to be kneeling or seated, rendered in muted blue and green tones. On the right, a standing figure, primarily in orange, is shown in profile, with one arm raised. The figures are stylized and lack detailed features, suggesting a devotional scene. The overall impression is one of movement and interaction between the two individuals, though their specific identities and actions are obscured by the condition of the pigment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too damaged to definitively interpret. However, the presence of two figures, one possibly in a supplicant posture and the other in a more active stance, could suggest a biblical narrative or a devotional scene involving prayer or intercession. Without clearer iconography, a specific interpretation is not possible.",
