    "scene_description_enriched": "Within an illuminated initial 'O', a female figure with blonde hair and a halo is depicted in prayer, her hands clasped. She is seated on a creature that appears to be a centaur, with the upper body of a woman and the lower body of a horse-like animal. The scene is set indoors, with a brick wall and two diamond-shaped windows visible behind her. To her right, an arched opening reveals a landscape with rolling green hills and trees. The floor is tiled in a blue and white checkered pattern. The figure's posture and the halo suggest a devotional or religious context, possibly representing a saint or a figure in contemplation.",
