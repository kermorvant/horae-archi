    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an interior space with two figures in the foreground and another in the background. On the left, a person in a red robe and black hat stands, holding a blue pouch and offering something small in their outstretched hand. To their right, a person in a blue tunic, white stockings, and a black hat carries a basket and a dark circular object. In the background, through an opening, a smaller figure in a blue tunic is seen carrying a bundle of straw or reeds. Above the main scene, within a circular frame, a woman is depicted holding two palm branches. The overall setting appears to be a domestic or working space, possibly a barn or storage area, with bundles of harvested material visible.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a month from a calendar cycle, possibly August, given the harvest imagery. The woman in the roundel might be a symbolic representation of the month or a related allegorical figure. The activities depicted, such as carrying bundles and the general atmosphere, suggest agricultural labor associated with harvest time.",
