    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Baptist seated outdoors, gesturing with his right hand towards a lamb standing to his right. He is dressed in a golden tunic and a red mantle, with a halo around his head. He holds a book in his left hand. The lamb, also with a halo, is accompanied by a staff topped with a cross and a banner. Behind Saint John, a stone structure with a dark opening is visible, partially covered by greenery. The background features a rolling landscape with trees and hills under a pale blue sky. This imagery represents Saint John the Baptist, often depicted with a lamb as a symbol of Christ (the Lamb of God) and his role as a precursor.",
