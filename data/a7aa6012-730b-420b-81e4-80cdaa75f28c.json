God the Father, robed in red and holding an orb, places a crown upon the head of the kneeling Virgin Mary, who is dressed in blue and has her hands clasped in prayer. Above them, the Holy Spirit is represented as a dove radiating light. The figures are seated on ornate wooden structures, suggesting a throne or celestial setting. The background features a radiating halo of light and decorative architectural elements, framed by an arched border with clouds and a butterfly.",
