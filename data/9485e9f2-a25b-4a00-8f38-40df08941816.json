    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a woman due to the attire and headdress, stands indoors within a room. She wears a blue outer garment over a striped pink and white underdress, and holds a green book. Her head is adorned with a golden, jeweled headdress. Behind her, a red tapestry with gold patterns hangs on the wall, and two diamond-paned windows are visible. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern of red, white, and blue. To her right, a large window opens to a landscape of rolling green hills under a blue sky. She is holding a black object with a zigzag handle, which appears to be a tool for tending a fire or perhaps a musical instrument, and is looking towards a black, rectangular object on the floor, possibly a brazier or a musical stand.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a specific biblical or liturgical event. It appears to be a genre scene or a portrait of a noblewoman engaged in an activity within her domestic space, possibly reading or playing music.",
