    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, flowing blonde hair, draped in a red cloak, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. She is positioned within a rocky grotto, with a view of a green, rolling landscape with trees visible through an opening. To the left, a small, cylindrical vessel with a lid sits on the ground. Above and to the left, an angel with golden wings descends from a golden halo, reaching towards the woman. The scene is framed by trees on either side and a decorative border at the top.",
