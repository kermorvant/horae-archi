    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, three figures are depicted. On the left, a bearded figure with long hair, possibly male, holds a smaller figure or object to its chest. This figure is partially draped. To the right, two other figures, also with long hair, are shown. One figure is reaching towards the central figure, while the other stands slightly behind, holding a small object, possibly a candle or torch. The background is filled with stippling, suggesting a starry or celestial setting. The scene is enclosed within a decorative border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is not clearly identifiable as a standard biblical or devotional event. The figures and their interactions do not immediately correspond to common iconographic representations. Without further context or clearer visual cues, a definitive interpretation is not possible.",
