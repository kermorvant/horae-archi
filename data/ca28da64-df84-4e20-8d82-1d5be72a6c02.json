    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, with beards and wearing blue and green robes, gaze upwards with awe. Above them, a figure with a golden halo, dressed in a reddish-brown robe, ascends into a starry sky. Rays of golden light emanate from this ascending figure, illuminating the scene. The background features a red sky with golden clouds and stars, transitioning to a rocky, earthy landscape with a stylized tree on the right. This scene depicts the Ascension of Christ, a pivotal event in Christian theology where Jesus ascended into heaven after his resurrection, witnessed by his disciples.",
