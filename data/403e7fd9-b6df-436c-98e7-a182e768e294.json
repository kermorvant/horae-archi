    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in a richly decorated interior. He wears a blue dalmatic beneath a pink cope, both adorned with gold embroidery. His right hand, clad in a white glove, points outwards, while his left hand holds a small, round object, possibly a relic or a fruit. The background features dark, textured walls with decorative bands and what appears to be an arched architectural element. The scene is likely a devotional image of a saintly bishop.",
