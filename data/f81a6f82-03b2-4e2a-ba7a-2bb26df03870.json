    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in a blue robe kneeling with his hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. He is accompanied by two other men standing behind him, one in a red robe and the other in a green tunic. To the right, a woman in a red and gold gown, wearing an elaborate headdress, points upwards. Above her, the Virgin Mary, crowned and holding the Christ Child, appears on a cloud. Rays of light emanate from the divine figures. In the foreground, a discarded crown and two small stones lie on the ground amidst foliage. The architectural elements suggest a setting that is partially enclosed, with columns and a wall visible, but also open to a landscape.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Vision of Saint Helena, who is credited with finding the True Cross. The kneeling man could be a supplicant or a representation of someone receiving divine revelation. The presence of the Virgin Mary and Christ Child indicates a divine vision or intercession. The discarded crown symbolizes the renunciation of earthly power or the recognition of a higher authority, often associated with the discovery of the True Cross.",
