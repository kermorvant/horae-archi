    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King David in prayer, kneeling on a green hillside with his hands clasped. He wears a crown, a blue mantle over a red tunic, and white hose. Behind him, a golden harp rests against a rocky outcrop. In the background, several figures tend to sheep on rolling hills, with trees dotting the landscape. Above, within a circular halo radiating golden light, a bearded figure, likely God the Father, is depicted blessing. The entire scene is framed by an elaborate foliate border with decorative elements.",
