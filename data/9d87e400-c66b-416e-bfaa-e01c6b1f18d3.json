    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ, set within an arched architectural structure that opens to a landscape view. Christ, with a halo, is bound to a central column, his body showing marks of scourging. Several figures surround him: one in blue and gold attire appears to be a guard, another in green holds a whip, and others in purple and green are shown striking Christ with rods. A figure in red is on his knees, sweeping the floor. The background reveals a city with towers and buildings, viewed through arcades supported by columns.",
