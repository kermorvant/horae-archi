    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, cradles the Christ Child, who is naked and looking towards the viewer. Three Magi are present: one, wearing a red cap, offers a gift; another, with a blue turban, holds a golden chest; and the third, an older man with a white beard, kneels and presents a golden chalice. The background shows a stone archway leading to an outdoor scene with trees, and the interior of the stable is suggested by wooden beams and a thatched roof.",
