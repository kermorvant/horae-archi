He is draped in a golden mantle and a green cloth. Below him, several figures with halos are kneeling and looking up at him in adoration. These figures are dressed in blue and red robes. The ground is depicted as green with sparse yellow vegetation. The overall impression is one of divine revelation or ascension.",
