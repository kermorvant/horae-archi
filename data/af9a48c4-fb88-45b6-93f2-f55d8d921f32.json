    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape under a blue sky, framed by an arched border with decorative elements. In the foreground, two shepherds are present. One shepherd, wearing a purple robe and blue hood, looks upwards with his hand raised, holding a staff. Beside him, another shepherd, dressed in a blue tunic and hood, plays a bagpipe. A dog sits attentively at their feet, and several sheep are scattered in the background. Above them, a group of figures, likely angels, are depicted in a celestial realm, with golden rays emanating from them, suggesting divine intervention or revelation. The rocky, mountainous terrain behind the shepherds further emphasizes the outdoor setting.",
