    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross in the center. His body is emaciated and bleeding, with a loincloth around his waist. To the left, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, stands with her hands clasped in sorrow. To the right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also with hands clasped in prayer and wearing a golden robe over a blue garment, gazes towards Christ. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a blue sky with hints of clouds. At the base of the cross, a skull is visible, symbolizing Golgotha. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
