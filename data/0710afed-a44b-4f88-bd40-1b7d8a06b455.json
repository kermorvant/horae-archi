    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an arched frame. On the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, is seated, looking down at an open book on a lectern. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers above her. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, adorned in a red robe over a white tunic and with large wings, kneels and gestures towards Mary, holding a scroll with Latin text. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior space with a bed canopy on the left and windows with tracery on the right, through which sunlight streams. The background features a green, patterned tapestry.",
