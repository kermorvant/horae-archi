    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with green wings and a halo hovers above a pastoral scene. The angel holds a musical instrument, possibly a harp or lyre, and looks down towards the earth. Below, three shepherds are depicted in a green, grassy landscape dotted with red flowers. One shepherd, seated, plays a pipe. Another shepherd, standing, gestures upwards with his hand. A third shepherd, kneeling, holds a shepherd's crook. Several sheep are scattered around the figures, and a dog is visible in the foreground. The background is a rich, textured gold, suggesting a divine or heavenly presence, with a stylized sun radiating light in the upper right corner.",
