    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in conversation, framed by stylized architectural elements. On the left, a winged figure, likely an angel, is shown with flowing hair and drapery, gesturing with both hands. Facing the angel is a bearded man wearing a hat and a robe, also gesturing. Behind them, simplified representations of buildings with arched windows and gabled roofs are visible. The overall composition suggests a narrative or devotional moment, possibly a divine visitation or message.",
