    "scene_description_enriched": "Four winged figures, identified as angels, are depicted in a celestial setting against a dark blue, star-filled sky. Two angels, one in pink and one in green, kneel at the bottom, supporting a golden chalice-like structure. Above them, two other angels, also in pink and green robes, reach towards the top, holding crowns. In the center, within a circular frame, is an image of Christ on the cross, depicted in a stylized manner with wounds and bloodstains, surrounded by a halo and what appears to be a representation of the cosmos or a celestial sphere. The entire scene is framed by decorative borders with inscribed Latin text.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the \"Arma Christi\" (Instruments of the Passion) or a related devotional image, possibly combined with the Coronation of Christ or the Virgin. The central image of Christ on the cross, along with the chalice (potentially symbolizing the Eucharist or the blood of Christ), and the crowns held by angels, all point to themes of Christ's sacrifice, redemption, and divine authority. The presence of angels further emphasizes the celestial and divine nature of the event.",
