    "scene_description_enriched": "A king, adorned with a golden crown and a richly decorated pink robe, kneels in prayer outdoors. He faces a fortified tower with crenellations and a prominent turret, from which barred windows reveal figures within. In the sky above, a divine figure, possibly God or Christ, is depicted descending from heaven, with a hand outstretched as if in blessing or communication. The background features a lush, green landscape with trees and rolling hills, culminating in distant, hazy fortifications. This scene likely represents a moment of divine intervention or a plea for divine favor, possibly related to the king's imprisonment or a significant event in his life.",
