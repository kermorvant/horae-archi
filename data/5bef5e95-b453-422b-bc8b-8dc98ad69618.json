    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely King David, kneels in prayer before an open book on a wooden table. He is richly dressed in a red tunic with gold embroidery and a blue mantle lined with ermine. To his left, a golden harp stands beside the table, and a small crown rests on a white cushion. The background features a red tapestry with a floral pattern, beyond which are green trees against a blue sky. The scene is enclosed within a decorative border typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
