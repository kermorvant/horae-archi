    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, likely King David, with a grey beard and wearing a royal blue and gold robe trimmed with ermine, embraces a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, who is dressed in a blue mantle and gown. They stand in front of a prominent golden tower with arched openings. In the background, a walled city with spires and buildings is depicted under a starry blue sky. The scene is set outdoors, with a grassy foreground and scattered bushes. The embrace and the presence of the Virgin Mary suggest a devotional scene, possibly related to the life of David or a contemplation of Mary's purity and role.",
