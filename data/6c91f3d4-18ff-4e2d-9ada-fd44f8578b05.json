    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an ornate architectural setting. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, is seated and reading from a book, her gaze directed downwards. To her left, the Angel Gabriel, adorned in a richly decorated robe and holding a scepter, appears to be delivering his message. A scroll with Latin text and lilies, symbolizing purity, unfurls between them. Above, in a separate architectural compartment, two angels are shown, one leaning over another who is asleep in a bed. Rays of divine light descend from the upper left, and a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers above the Virgin. The architecture features elaborate golden tracery, arches, and what appears to be a cityscape in the background.",
