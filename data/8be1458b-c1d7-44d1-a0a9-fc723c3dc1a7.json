    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child, who also has a halo. Saint Joseph, also with a halo, walks beside the donkey, holding its reins. They are traveling through a landscape with rolling green hills and a path. In the background, there are buildings with towers and roofs, suggesting a town or city. A prominent golden column with a figure balancing on top stands in the middle ground. The overall impression is one of a sacred journey through a somewhat stylized, medieval setting.",
