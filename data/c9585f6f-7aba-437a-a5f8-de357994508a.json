    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, a bearded king, crowned and robed, holds a golden orb and points. Above him, a red, ornate canopy frames him against a blue background. In the center, the Angel Gabriel, with large blue wings and wearing a patterned yellow robe, kneels and gestures with a scepter towards the Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is depicted with a halo, hands clasped in prayer, and looking down at an open book on a wooden table. Behind her, a red curtain hangs, and a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. The background features architectural elements suggesting an interior space with arched openings and decorative friezes.",
