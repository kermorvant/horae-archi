    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, identified as Saint Christopher, is depicted in profile, facing right. He wears a brown, brimmed hat adorned with white markings, a blue robe with gold embellishments, and a red undergarment. A brown satchel hangs from his shoulder, and he carries a long staff diagonally across his body. In his hands, he holds an open book with text rendered in a stylized, illegible script. The background features a green, grassy landscape with stylized trees and distant blue mountains, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figure's attire and the staff are indicative of a pilgrim or traveler.",
