    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Baptist seated outdoors, with a halo around his head, holding an open book in his lap. He is dressed in a brown tunic and a red cloak. To his right, a lamb stands with a halo, and behind it, a banner with a cross and a white cloth is visible. The background features a body of water, lush green trees, and distant blue mountains under a light blue sky. The figure's bare feet are visible, and his long hair and beard are rendered in detail. The overall setting is pastoral and serene.",
