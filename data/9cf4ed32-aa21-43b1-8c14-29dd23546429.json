    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated on the left, reading from a book. Beside her stands a woman, possibly a midwife, looking towards the manger. In the center, the Christ Child lies in a wooden manger, reaching out a hand. To the right, an older man, likely Saint Joseph, sits with a staff, wearing a green hood and a pink robe. A cow and a donkey are visible behind the manger, and a small fire burns on the floor in the foreground. The structure appears to be a simple shelter with a thatched roof.",
