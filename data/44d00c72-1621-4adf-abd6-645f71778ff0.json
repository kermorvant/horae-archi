    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint, stands draped in a flowing pink robe. She holds a golden vessel, possibly an ointment jar, in her left hand. Her gaze is downcast, and her expression is serene. Behind her, a dark, patterned tapestry serves as a backdrop. To her right, a stylized, organic form, perhaps a rock or a tree trunk, rises vertically. To her left, a blue, rounded form rests on a patch of green ground with gold accents, suggesting foliage. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of the ointment jar strongly suggests this is a depiction of one of the Myrrh-bearing Women at the tomb of Christ, or Mary Magdalene, who came to anoint Jesus' body after his crucifixion. The halo indicates her saintly status.",
