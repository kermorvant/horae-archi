To his left, the Virgin Mary kneels, her hands crossed over her chest, with a halo. Above her, two angels descend, holding a crown, which they are about to place on her head. The background is a deep blue, adorned with golden stars, suggesting a celestial setting. A red, patterned canopy is visible above Christ. The figures are positioned within an architectural framework suggested by a golden, patterned floor and a row of arched openings in the background.",
