    "scene_description_enriched": "A profile view of a woman, likely a queen or noblewoman, is depicted. She wears a red garment draped over her shoulders and a headdress. The background is a muted, textured beige, suggesting an interior setting. The figure's face is rendered with delicate features, and her gaze is directed to the right. The overall impression is one of solemnity and dignity. Without further context or surrounding figures, a specific religious interpretation is not possible, but the regal attire suggests a figure of importance within a devotional narrative.",
