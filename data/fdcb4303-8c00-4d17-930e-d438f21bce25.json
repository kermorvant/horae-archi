    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in a golden chasuble and a mitre, stands before an altar, gesturing towards a chalice and an open book. He is surrounded by several figures, including monks in golden habits and laymen in red and blue tunics. The scene takes place within a richly decorated interior, likely a church or chapel, indicated by the presence of columns, an altar, and what appears to be a reredos behind the altar. The architectural elements suggest a Gothic style, with pointed arches visible in the background. The overall atmosphere is one of solemnity and religious observance, likely depicting a liturgical ceremony.",
