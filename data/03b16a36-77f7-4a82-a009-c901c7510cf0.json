    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a solemn encounter within an interior space. On the left, a bearded man with grey hair, wearing a red robe and a blue collar, sits on a raised platform or chair, gesturing with his hands. Facing him is a figure, presumably Christ, dressed in a dark blue robe adorned with gold, with his hands bound. He is surrounded by several soldiers in golden armor, some holding spears. The background is a muted grey, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a hall or courtroom. The overall impression is one of judgment or accusation.",
