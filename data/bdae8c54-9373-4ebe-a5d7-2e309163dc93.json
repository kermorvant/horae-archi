Her expression is somber. To her right, a bearded man in monastic attire, with his hands raised in a gesture of speaking or supplication, faces her. Behind them, a stylized representation of buildings with arched windows and roofs suggests an urban or ecclesiastical environment. The overall composition is framed by an ornamental arch.",
