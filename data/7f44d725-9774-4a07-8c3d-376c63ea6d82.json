    "scene_description_enriched": "Three skeletal figures, representing the dead, are depicted walking. The figure on the left holds a processional cross. The central figure carries a scythe over its shoulder and a shovel. The figure on the right walks with arms outstretched. They are positioned in front of a grey stone wall, with a blue sky above adorned with gold decorative elements. The ground is rendered with green grass. Below the figures, a decorative band contains Latin text and illuminated initials, suggesting this is part of a manuscript.",
