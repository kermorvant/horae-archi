    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man, likely King David, kneeling with his hands raised in prayer. He is dressed in a red robe over a blue tunic, with a white ermine-lined cloak. He is positioned in a rocky, outdoor landscape with a tree and foliage. In the upper left, a haloed figure, possibly God or an angel, is shown with hands outstretched towards a group of orange, flame-like forms within a blue and gold circular motif. The background is a decorative grid of blue, red, and gold squares. A harp is visible leaning against a rock in the foreground.",
