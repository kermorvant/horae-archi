    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified by a halo as a significant religious figure, stands behind a wooden lectern draped with a blue cloth decorated with circular motifs. He gestures with his hands as if teaching or preaching to a group of men seated before him. The men are dressed in rich robes and turbans, with one wearing a crown, suggesting they are important figures or possibly royalty. The scene is set outdoors, with a stone wall and trees in the background, under a sky dotted with stars. The overall composition is framed by an ornate border with floral and foliate motifs.",
