    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of people are gathered in a grassy, outdoor setting. An elderly man with a long white beard, dressed in a blue robe with gold trim, raises his hands and looks upwards, seemingly in prayer or supplication. Behind him, a crowd of men and women, also in richly colored attire, observe. Some of the women wear blue dresses with puffed sleeves and gold trim, while one wears a green dress. One man in the foreground, to the right, wears a blue robe and holds a circular object, possibly a tambourine or a plate. The background features a stylized sky with a blue expanse dotted with golden stars above a red, cloud-like pattern with golden accents. The scene evokes a sense of communal devotion or a significant event being witnessed.",
