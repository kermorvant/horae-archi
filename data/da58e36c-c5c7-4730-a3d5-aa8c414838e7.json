    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an interior space with a large, golden balance scale suspended from the ceiling. The scale has two shallow pans, one on each side, hanging by thin cords. The background shows a dimly lit architectural setting with what appear to be doorways or openings in the distance. The overall impression is one of a place where judgment or measurement is taking place. The presence of the balance scale strongly suggests a theme of justice or divine judgment.",
