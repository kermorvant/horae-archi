    "scene_description_enriched": "Three men are depicted in a scene framed by an arched architectural element and foliage. The man on the left wears a cap and a tunic with decorative buttons, holding his hands clasped. The man in the center wears a hood, and the man on the right wears a tunic and a bag slung over his shoulder, facing the other two. Below them, the heads of several animals, possibly dogs or wolves, are visible. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with hatching to create shading and texture. The overall impression is of a narrative scene, possibly from a secular story or a biblical episode involving animals.",
