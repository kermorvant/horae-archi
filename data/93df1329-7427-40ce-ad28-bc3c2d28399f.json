    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe and veil, stands holding an open book, her hands resting on its pages. Before her, the Angel Gabriel kneels, wearing a green cloak over a pink garment, and looking up towards Mary. A scroll with text emerges from behind Gabriel and curves towards Mary. Behind Mary, a pink canopy is visible, and a patterned blue and gold background suggests an interior space. Above, in a blue archway, a bearded figure, possibly God the Father, looks down. The floor is tiled in a black and white checkerboard pattern.",
