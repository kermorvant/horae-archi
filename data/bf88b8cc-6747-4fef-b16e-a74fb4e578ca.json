    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with large red wings and a golden halo descends from a bright blue sky, radiating light. Below, in a pastoral landscape, two shepherds are tending their flock of sheep. One shepherd, kneeling and looking upwards with an outstretched arm, appears startled or awestruck. The other shepherd sits on a grassy incline, also looking upwards. A small dog lies near the kneeling shepherd. In the background, a simple wooden cart with wheels is parked near a small shed, and a body of water with trees lining its banks is visible. The scene depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a pivotal moment in the Nativity story where angels announce the birth of Christ to humble shepherds.",
