    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a golden halo, is seated and cradles the Christ Child. She wears a vibrant blue robe and holds a small golden orb in her hand, which the child reaches for. Behind them, a green canopy, adorned with gold lettering and a crown-like motif, is suspended. The background features a red tapestry with intricate gold patterns, and beyond that, architectural elements suggesting a grand interior with tall windows. The scene is framed by a golden arch supported by fluted columns.",
