    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and holding a book and palm frond, stands in a garden setting. She is depicted with blonde hair, wearing a blue undergarment and an orange mantle. Behind her, a stylized tree grows from a rocky mound on the right, while on the left, a miniature tower with a flag stands prominently. The background is a rich red tapestry adorned with gold scrolling patterns, and the entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements. The saint's posture and attributes suggest a devotional representation, possibly of a martyr or a learned saint.",
