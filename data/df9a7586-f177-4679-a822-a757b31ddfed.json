    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. Saint Joseph, bearded and wearing a hat, leads a horse on which the Virgin Mary is seated, holding the Christ Child. The Virgin Mary wears a veil and a halo. Behind them, two figures are visible: one appears to be a traveler with a bag, and the other is a soldier in armor. In the background, a city skyline with various buildings and trees is depicted. The ground is uneven, suggesting a rural landscape, and a stylized flower is visible in the foreground.",
