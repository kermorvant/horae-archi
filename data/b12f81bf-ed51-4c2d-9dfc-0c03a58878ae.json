They are accompanied by Saint Joseph, holding a staff, and another woman, possibly Saint Anne, also pregnant. The figures are set in a lush green landscape with trees and a winding path. In the background, a castle with towers and spires is visible, and above, a divine light emanates from a celestial vision of God the Father, with rays of light descending. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
