    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. The Angel Gabriel, with large wings and a blue drapery, descends from the clouds, holding a lily and a key. He is addressing the Virgin Mary, who is kneeling on the right, her hands crossed over her chest in a gesture of humility and acceptance. She is dressed in a pink robe and a blue mantle. Behind her, a wooden lectern holds an open book. To the right of the Virgin, architectural elements suggest an interior space, with fluted columns and a green drapery. Three cherubic heads with wings are visible in the upper left, amidst blue clouds, and a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, flies towards the Virgin.",
