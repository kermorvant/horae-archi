    "scene_description_enriched": "Three haloed female figures stand in a verdant landscape against a richly patterned gold, red, and blue background. The figure on the left wears a red gown and holds a chalice. The central figure, in a green garment, also holds a chalice, and the figure on the right, in a blue gown, holds a chalice and a palm frond. All three figures have palm fronds behind them, suggesting they are martyrs. The scene is likely a depiction of female martyrs, possibly holding symbols of their faith or martyrdom.",
