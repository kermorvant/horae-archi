    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left and the Virgin Mary on the right. The angel, with large blue wings and a red robe over a blue tunic, stands on clouds and gestures towards Mary. He holds a scroll. Mary, wearing a blue mantle over a red dress, stands with her hands clasped in prayer and holds a book. Between them is a green staff topped with a cross, and a vase-like object rests on the ground. The background is a golden, textured surface, framed by architectural elements that suggest a stylized cityscape with towers and arched structures. The overall composition is framed by decorative borders.",
