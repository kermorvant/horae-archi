The man on the right wears a brown hood and a red tunic over a green garment. His hands are clasped in prayer. The background is a vibrant blue, possibly representing the sky, with some indistinct swirling forms and small dots that could be stars. To the right, a stylized, light blue architectural element with circular motifs and vertical lines is visible, suggesting a building or decorative structure.",
