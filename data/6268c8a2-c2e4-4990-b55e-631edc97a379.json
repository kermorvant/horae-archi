    "scene_description_enriched": "A skeletal figure, personifying Death, is seated on a golden sarcophagus, wearing a crown and holding a spear tipped with an arrow. Death cradles a human skull in its lap. The scene is set in a walled garden with a brick wall, and in the background, a walled city with a prominent cathedral and other buildings is visible, nestled against a hill. To the right, a small, ornate tomb or shrine stands in the grass. The overall composition, with Death as a crowned monarch holding symbols of mortality, evokes the theme of the universality of death.",
