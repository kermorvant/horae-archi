    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of women, some crowned and others in religious habits, interacting in a setting that blends architectural elements with a celestial vision. In the upper portion, three figures, likely Christ and two saints or prophets, are seated on clouds, reading from an open book. Below them, a cityscape with buildings and towers is visible. In the foreground, several women are gathered. One woman in a pink gown and crown is embraced by a nun in a dark habit. Another woman in a blue gown holds a red bag, and a third woman in a purple and gold dress holds a red rose. Two winged figures, possibly angels, stand behind the women, holding banners. A small, detailed church building is depicted in the lower left corner.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a gathering of holy women or martyrs, possibly including Saint Ursula and her companions, or a representation of the Church Triumphant. The celestial vision above suggests divine approval or a heavenly reward. The presence of a nun and crowned women could signify different states of religious devotion or martyrdom. The rose is a common symbol of the Virgin Mary and purity, while the banners might represent victory or faith.",
