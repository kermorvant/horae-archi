    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a reclining figure, likely deceased, who is covered by a shroud. The figures are shown in profile and frontal views, with several men and women looking towards the central figure. One woman, positioned to the left, holds a palm frond, a symbol often associated with martyrdom or victory. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element above, suggesting an interior or a niche. The overall impression is one of mourning or veneration.",
