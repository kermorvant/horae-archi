    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a brutal act of violence against infants, likely the Massacre of the Innocents. In the foreground, a soldier in full armor holds a baby aloft, preparing to strike it with his sword, while another infant lies on the ground, seemingly already slain, covered by a pink cloth. A woman in an orange dress kneels, reaching out towards the infant being held. Behind them, a man in a blue robe and a distinctive hat, possibly a king or a figure of authority, gestures towards the scene, accompanied by a person in a pink headdress holding a scepter. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible, set against a green landscape with trees. The overall impression is one of chaos and cruelty, underscored by the presence of armed soldiers and the vulnerability of the infants.",
