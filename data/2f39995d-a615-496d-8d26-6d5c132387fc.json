    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her halo, seated and engaged in spinning wool. Beside her, two other women are also present, one in a green gown and the other in a red gown, seemingly interacting with each other or the spinning process. A young figure, possibly an angel due to the presence of wings, kneels and offers a small orb and a vessel. A small dog is also visible in the foreground. The figures are situated within an architectural setting characterized by a domed structure with arched openings and windows, suggesting an interior space that is partially open or has a view to the exterior. The background is adorned with a rich red tapestry. This scene is likely a representation of the Virgin Mary's domestic life and her piety, possibly alluding to the weaving of Christ's garments or the thread of life.",
