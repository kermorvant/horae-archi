    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint, is depicted in a devotional pose, looking downwards. She wears a golden headdress and a white garment adorned with gold accents, over which a red robe with gold embroidery is draped. Her hands are clasped, holding a dark, sword-like object, possibly symbolizing martyrdom. The background is a stylized landscape with blue mountains and green, tufted vegetation under a blue sky. Golden rays emanate from behind her head, suggesting divine favor or a heavenly presence.",
