    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine coronation. A bearded man, crowned and robed in red and green, extends his hand towards a kneeling woman who is also crowned and dressed in blue. Above them, an angel descends, holding a golden halo with a crown over the woman's head. The background is a rich red tapestry with gold floral motifs. The figures are positioned on a raised platform with architectural elements suggesting a throne or a sacred space. The overall impression is one of divine investiture and exaltation.",
