    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Matthew, identifiable by his halo and scholarly attire, seated and writing in a large book with a quill. He is dressed in a red robe and a blue mantle. Before him is a lectern holding the book. To his right, an angel with large blue wings and a pink mantle kneels, holding a golden object that resembles a scroll or a reliquary. The setting appears to be an interior space with a richly decorated wall tapestry behind Saint Matthew. An arched opening reveals a landscape with buildings in the distance. The ceiling above is a vibrant blue with golden stars, suggesting a celestial or divine influence.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene represents the Evangelist Saint Matthew writing his Gospel, inspired by divine revelation, as symbolized by the presence of the angel. This is a common depiction of the \"Evangelist Writing\" theme in Christian art.",
