    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal courtly gathering within an architectural setting suggestive of a palace or grand hall. A crowned king, with a long beard, is seated on a throne, holding a scepter. Before him, a young woman, also crowned, kneels and presents a chalice. Behind her, two other women stand, one with a veiled head. To the right of the king, another figure, possibly a queen or noblewoman, is visible, also crowned. The background features architectural elements such as pointed arches and decorative pinnacles, framing the figures. The overall impression is one of a formal presentation or offering within a regal environment.",
