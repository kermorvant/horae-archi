    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with curly brown hair and a beard kneels on a reddish-pink surface, looking upwards with his hands raised in supplication. He wears a green tunic over a yellow robe. Behind him, a textured gold background suggests a divine or celestial setting. A hand, presumably belonging to a divine figure, is visible in the upper right corner, reaching down towards the kneeling man. The scene likely depicts a moment of prayer or divine intervention.",
