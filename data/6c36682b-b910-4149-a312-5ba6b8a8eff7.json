    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer before a book on a stand, draped in a blue mantle. To her right, the Angel Gabriel, with large wings and a halo, kneels and gestures upwards with his right hand, holding a golden staff. Above the angel, the Holy Spirit is represented as a dove descending in a ray of divine light. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the presence of a richly decorated canopy behind the Virgin and a dark, ornate wall or screen behind the angel. The floor is tiled.",
