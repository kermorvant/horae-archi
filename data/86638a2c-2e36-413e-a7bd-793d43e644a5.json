He wears a blue robe over a golden cloak and holds a globe topped with a cross in his left hand, while raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing. He is surrounded by numerous winged, fiery seraphim, depicted with red bodies and golden halos, some with their hands clasped in prayer. The background is a deep blue, with golden rays emanating from behind God. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs and a bird at the top left.",
