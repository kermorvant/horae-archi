    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a Nativity, with the Christ Child lying in a manger in the foreground. Behind him, a group of figures, possibly including the Virgin Mary and Joseph, are gathered. Above them, several figures with halos, likely angels, are shown in prayer. The setting appears to be a stable or a simple interior space, suggested by the wooden structure on the left. The scene is framed by an arched opening and decorative borders.",
