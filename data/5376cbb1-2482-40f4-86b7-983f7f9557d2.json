    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, identified as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, kneels in prayer with her hands clasped. She is dressed in a blue gown with a white patterned tunic. Behind her, a man in a red tunic raises a large sword, poised to strike her head. To the right, a wooden structure with a large wheel, likely a breaking wheel, is visible. Behind this, two figures are observing the scene: one is a woman in a dark hooded garment, and the other is a man wearing a crown, suggesting royalty. In the background, a castle with towers and battlements is depicted amidst a green, hilly landscape with trees. The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Catherine.",
