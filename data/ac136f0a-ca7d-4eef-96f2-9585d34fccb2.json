    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo, reaching out towards a man emerging from a dark, rectangular opening, possibly a tomb. Christ is dressed in a white robe and is accompanied by several figures, including an older man with a beard and halo, and two women, one in blue and another in white. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a distant town with spires. The man emerging from the tomb is partially unclothed and appears to be rising. This scene is interpreted as the Resurrection of Christ, a pivotal event in Christian theology.",
