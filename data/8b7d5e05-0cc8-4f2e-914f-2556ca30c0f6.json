    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child on his shoulders. Saint Christopher, a bearded man with a staff, is shown wading through water, indicated by the patterned ground. The Christ Child, positioned on his shoulders, holds a cross and raises one hand in blessing. They are framed by an architectural element resembling an arch, with a dotted background suggesting a stylized, perhaps celestial, setting. The figures are rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching.",
