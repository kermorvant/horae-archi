    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, holds the Christ Child, who is looking towards the viewer. They are accompanied by a woman in red carrying a basket, likely representing a supplicant or follower. Facing them is an elderly man with a beard, possibly Simeon, dressed in rich robes, and another figure in a red cap. They stand before a stone building with a large, ornate window and niches containing statues. The architecture suggests a religious building, possibly a church or temple, with Gothic stylistic elements. The background shows a blue sky and a lone green tree against a red wall.",
