    "scene_description_enriched": "In a scene set against a richly patterned red and blue textile backdrop, an older man with a white beard, dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold trim, kneels and presents a sword to a younger man. The younger man, also in a blue robe and a tan cloak, receives the sword with his right hand while his left hand is extended towards a wooden structure that resembles a bed or a low altar. Behind the younger man, a group of four men in blue robes look on. Above, a hand emerges from a green sleeve, holding a golden disc with Roman numerals, suggesting divine intervention or a celestial event. The ground is depicted with green grass and small golden objects, one resembling a vessel, and the wooden structure is also decorated with golden elements. This scene likely depicts a biblical or historical event where a significant weapon is being bestowed, possibly related to a covenant or a divine commission.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely an illustration of a biblical event, possibly the investiture of a leader or warrior, or a moment of divine instruction. The presence of the hand from above and the symbolic disc could represent God's will or a prophecy. The sword is a symbol of power and authority, and its presentation suggests a transfer of responsibility or a call to action. Without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact event, but it carries themes of leadership, destiny, and divine sanction.",
