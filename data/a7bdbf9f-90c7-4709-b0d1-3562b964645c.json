He has a visible face with eyes, nose, and mouth, and is wearing a hooded garment. The figure is surrounded by decorative, swirling vegetal or wave-like motifs, suggesting a stylized or symbolic setting rather than a literal architectural or natural environment. The overall impression is one of devotion or distress.",
