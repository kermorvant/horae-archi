    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures under a large, segmented arch. On the left, a kneeling figure with a hooded head holds a shallow bowl. To the right, a standing figure wearing a crown and a long robe holds two small animals, possibly lambs or fawns, one in each arm. Behind this figure, another person, also hooded, stands with their head slightly bowed. In the background, a building with a pointed roof and two windows is visible. The overall impression is one of charity or offering, possibly related to a biblical or devotional narrative.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents an act of charity or sacrifice. The kneeling figure receiving or offering the bowl, and the standing figure presenting animals, could symbolize generosity, almsgiving, or a sacrificial offering. Without further context, a specific biblical event is difficult to pinpoint, but it aligns with themes of compassion and devotion common in Books of Hours.",
