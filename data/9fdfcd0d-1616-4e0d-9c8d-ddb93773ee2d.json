    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Baptist in a wilderness setting, characterized by rolling hills, lush green foliage, and a distant body of water. He is clad in a rough, animal-skin garment and points with his left hand to a lamb resting on an open book. The lamb is a symbol of Christ, and the book likely represents scripture. Saint John's halo indicates his saintly status. The image is framed by decorative borders, typical of medieval illuminated manuscripts.",
