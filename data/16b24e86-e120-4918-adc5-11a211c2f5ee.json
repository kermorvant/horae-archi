    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, wearing a pink robe and a crown of thorns, carrying a large wooden cross. He is surrounded by three figures. To his left, a man in armor and blue tunic, with a gold gorget, appears to be assisting or pushing him. To his right, a figure in a blue robe and red cloak also helps carry the cross. Behind Christ, a man in a dark tunic and blue hat raises his fist, seemingly in aggression or mockery. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling green hills, a few trees, and a distant blue sky with mountains. The overall impression is one of suffering and persecution.",
