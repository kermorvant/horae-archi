The Christ Child is reaching towards his mother. Behind them, Joseph, also with a golden halo, walks alongside the donkey, carrying a staff over his shoulder. He wears a white cap and tunic. The figures are set against a landscape with stylized trees and bushes, rendered in shades of grey and with touches of gold. In the background, a small building with a tower and a pitched roof is visible on a hill. The ground is depicted with undulating lines suggesting terrain and vegetation.",
