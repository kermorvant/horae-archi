He is dressed in a white robe and holds a sphere, possibly representing the Earth or the cosmos, in his left hand, while his right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or creation. Below him, concentric circles of blue and dark brown represent celestial spheres or the Earth itself, with a small white circle indicating a star or moon. The background is a rich gold leaf, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting. The text 'rby.' is written in blue script above the scene, and the numeral '24' is in the upper right corner.",
