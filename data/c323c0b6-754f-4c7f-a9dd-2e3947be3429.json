    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a barren tree with a few branches, set against a richly decorated red background with gold ornamentation. On the left, two figures in blue robes look upwards towards the tree, with one gesturing with clasped hands. To the right, a crowned figure in a gold tunic and blue robe touches their face, seemingly in contemplation or distress, accompanied by two other figures. Above, a figure with a halo, dressed in green, descends from a starry blue sky, reaching out a hand towards the scene below. The ground is depicted as a green grassy area with sparse vegetation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a prophetic vision or a divine intervention related to a king or important figure. The barren tree could symbolize a period of hardship or a prophecy of future events. The figure descending from the sky with a halo suggests a divine messenger or God himself, bestowing a vision or message. The crowned figure's gesture might indicate his reaction to this divine communication, possibly a prophecy of his lineage or kingdom. Without further context, a specific biblical event is difficult to pinpoint, but it evokes themes of divine revelation and royal destiny.",
