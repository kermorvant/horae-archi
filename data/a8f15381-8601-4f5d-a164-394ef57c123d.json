    "scene_description_enriched": "A king lies ill in a richly decorated bed, draped with blue and gold patterned fabric and curtains. A woman, possibly a queen or attendant, stands beside the bed, her hands raised in a gesture of concern or prayer. To the right, a man kneels or bows, his hands also raised, appearing to plead or offer comfort. The scene is set within an interior space, with a dark, recessed doorway or alcove visible behind the figures. To the far right, an exterior view shows a building with a tiled roof and a wall with arched windows, suggesting a courtyard or garden setting beyond the interior.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a king's illness and the prayers or supplications offered for his recovery. This could be a general representation of royal suffering or a specific biblical or historical event.",
