    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a fantastical creature, a Capricorn, in a lush green landscape. The creature has the forequarters of a goat, with a white, shaggy coat, long, curling horns adorned with gold, and a beard. Its hindquarters are that of a fish or serpent, covered in golden scales and ending in a coiled tail. The creature is positioned in profile, facing left, with its front legs extended as if in motion. Behind the creature, a dense forest of tall, slender trees with green foliage and gold accents creates a backdrop. In the distance, beyond the trees, a body of water is visible with a few boats, and a city skyline with tall buildings and spires. The overall scene is rendered with vibrant colors and decorative gold leaf, suggesting a symbolic or allegorical representation.",
