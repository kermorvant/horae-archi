Two angels with feathered wings stand behind them, looking on. To the right, an elderly man with a white beard and a red hat, likely Saint Joseph, walks alongside. In the background, a walled city with towers and buildings is visible under a blue sky. The foreground is a grassy landscape with scattered stones.
