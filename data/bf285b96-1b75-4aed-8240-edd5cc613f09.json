    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, bearing the weight of the cross, being assisted by several figures. Christ, in a grey robe, is shown with a halo, his face turned upwards in suffering. He is supported by a man in a pink tunic and another figure in a blue patterned robe and orange veil. To the right, a man in an orange tunic and blue leggings, wearing a distinctive blue and gold patterned hat, also helps carry the cross. The background is a rich gold, decorated with a geometric pattern of blue and red diamonds, framed by an elaborate blue and red border. The figures are rendered with expressive faces and gestures, conveying the arduousness of the journey.",
