    "scene_description_enriched": "A fox, dressed in a dark hooded robe, stands behind a golden lectern, holding a tablet with writing. In front of the lectern, a group of chickens and a rooster are gathered, seemingly listening. Another fox is positioned at the base of the lectern, sniffing the ground. The scene is set against a background of stylized foliage and small, decorative elements, suggesting an outdoor or garden setting. This imagery likely represents a fable or a moralizing tale, possibly a 'sermon' of the fox to the chickens, a common motif in medieval bestiaries and literature, often satirizing religious hypocrisy or the gullibility of the flock.",
