    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identified by his halo and central placement, interacting with a kneeling figure, likely a woman, who reaches out to touch him. Christ is dressed in a blue tunic and a pink mantle, while the kneeling figure wears a blue robe. Behind Christ, a group of male figures, all with halos, are gathered, some looking towards Christ and the kneeling figure, others engaged in conversation. The architectural setting is suggested by a building with a colonnade and crenellated parapet in the background, and a doorway or opening on the right. The floor is tiled in a pinkish hue. The overall impression is one of a significant religious encounter.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment of healing or forgiveness, possibly the woman with an issue of blood touching Christ's garment, or Christ receiving a supplicant. The presence of multiple haloed figures suggests a gathering of apostles or disciples witnessing the event.",
