    "scene_description_enriched": "A man and a woman are depicted riding together on a horse, with the man in front and the woman behind him, her arms around his waist. To the right, a third figure, possibly a man, is shown reaching out with a stick or rod towards the horse. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with a textured, dark background that could represent foliage or rough terrain. The figures are rendered in a stylized, somewhat crude manner, typical of some medieval illuminations. The overall impression is of a journey or an encounter in a natural setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a readily identifiable biblical or devotional event based on the visual evidence. It could represent a secular scene, a historical event, or a narrative from a non-biblical text. Without further context or clearer iconographic clues, a specific interpretation is not possible.",
