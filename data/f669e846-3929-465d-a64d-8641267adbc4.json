    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a landscape with a river in the foreground, bordered by grassy banks and trees. On a small island or promontory in the middle ground, a tall, square stone structure topped with a golden urn stands prominently. Behind this, more trees and a body of water are visible. In the background, a grand building complex with a prominent dome and classical architectural features stretches across the horizon, nestled amongst hills. The sky is a pale blue with scattered clouds, and the overall impression is one of serene, idealized nature and architecture.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not depict a specific biblical, liturgical, or hagiographic event. It is likely a decorative landscape, possibly intended to evoke a sense of classical beauty, pastoral tranquility, or an idealized setting.",
