    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with a halo and a scroll inscribed with text, gestures towards the Virgin Mary on the right. The Virgin Mary, also with a halo, is shown kneeling with her hands raised in a gesture of acceptance or surprise. She is positioned near an open book and a vase with lilies, symbols of purity. The background features dark, patterned drapery and a celestial element from which light emanates, suggesting a divine intervention. The overall setting is intimate and devotional, likely representing the moment of the Incarnation.",
