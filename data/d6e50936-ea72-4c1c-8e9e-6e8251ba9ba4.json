    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with several shepherds and a flock of sheep. In the foreground, a shepherd kneels with his hands raised, looking upwards. To his left, another shepherd stands, holding a staff and looking towards the sky. Other shepherds are visible behind them. In the middle ground, a shepherd lies on the ground, seemingly reacting to something above. In the sky, a golden angelic figure appears amidst clouds and golden rays, suggesting a divine revelation. In the background, a distant city with towers and spires is visible, nestled amongst rolling hills and trees. The overall scene is bathed in a soft, ethereal light.",
