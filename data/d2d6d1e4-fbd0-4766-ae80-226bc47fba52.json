    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint Jerome by his halo and scholarly activity, is depicted seated and writing. He wears a blue robe with gold stripes and a red cloak. His right hand is raised to his head, suggesting contemplation or distress, while his left hand rests on a book. Before him is a lectern holding a large illuminated manuscript, possibly the Bible, with a distinctive blue and white boot-like object resting on it, perhaps a symbolic representation or a misinterpretation of a scroll. To the left, a younger figure, possibly a monk or an acolyte, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, wearing a striped blue garment and a red headdress with two points. The scene is set within an architectural space, suggested by columns and a wall with vertical lines, implying an interior setting.",
