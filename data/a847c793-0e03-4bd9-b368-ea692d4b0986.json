    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely a saint or a prophet, in a landscape setting. The figure is shown reclining or falling, with one arm extended and the other bent. Above and to the right, a winged creature, possibly an angel or a demon, descends towards the figure. The background is filled with foliage and a dotted pattern, suggesting a natural or possibly a stylized celestial environment. The overall composition is dynamic, with a sense of struggle or divine intervention.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely an allegorical representation or a depiction of a hagiographic event, possibly involving a saint being tempted, attacked, or visited by a supernatural entity. Without further context or clearer iconography, a specific biblical or liturgical event cannot be definitively identified. However, the presence of a winged figure and a human figure in distress suggests a narrative of spiritual conflict or divine intervention.",
