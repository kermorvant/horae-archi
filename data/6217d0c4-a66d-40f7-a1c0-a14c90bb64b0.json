    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts God the Father, with a halo and a long beard, holding the cross on which Christ is crucified. Christ's body is rendered in a foreshortened perspective. Around them, several cherubic figures with wings and halos are present, some appearing to emerge from clouds or a decorative background. In the foreground, two architectural elements resembling small, ornate shrines or tabernacles are visible. The overall composition is framed by decorative borders, with a band of repeating geometric shapes at the top and a vertical band of 'X' shapes on the right.",
