    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of monks in white habits, seated and reading from illuminated books. They are positioned within an architectural setting that suggests a monastic library or scriptorium, characterized by tall, arched windows with blue backgrounds and gold cloud motifs. Above them, a vaulted ceiling with red and gold ribbing is visible, supported by slender columns. The overall impression is one of scholarly devotion and religious study within a sacred space.",
