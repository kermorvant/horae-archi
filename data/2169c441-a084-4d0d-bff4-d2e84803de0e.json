    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and holding the Christ Child, is within a simple wooden stable structure. The Christ Child is reaching towards a basket of gold offered by one of the kneeling Magi. Two other Magi, one presenting a chalice and the other a crown, are also present. A donkey and ox are visible behind the Virgin. The background features a mountainous landscape under a blue sky with rays of light emanating from the upper left, possibly symbolizing divine intervention or the Star of Bethlehem. In the distance, a small figure stands atop a tower-like structure, holding a spear and shield.",
