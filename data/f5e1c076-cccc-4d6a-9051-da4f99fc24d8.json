    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely Saint Andrew, stands in a landscape, holding a large wooden cross. He is dressed in a pink tunic and a blue mantle. The background depicts rolling hills with sparse trees and a distant, indistinct building. The figure's gaze is directed away from the viewer, and his expression suggests contemplation or suffering. The scene is rendered in a typical medieval manuscript style with vibrant colors and a focus on the central figure and his attribute.",
