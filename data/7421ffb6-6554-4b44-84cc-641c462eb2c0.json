    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures engaged in archery. In the foreground, two men are shown drawing their bows, aiming towards the left. One figure is in profile, drawing a bow with an arrow nocked. Behind them, a larger, cylindrical structure, possibly a tower or a siege engine, is visible, with several figures standing on top, some raising their arms. The background is a light blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall impression is one of military action or a training exercise.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene does not appear to depict a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional event commonly found in Books of Hours. It is more likely a secular illustration, possibly representing a historical event, a military training exercise, or a scene from a romance or epic poem.",
