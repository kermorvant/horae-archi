    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures are depicted within an architectural setting. On the left, a seated figure, possibly male, is gesturing with his hands and holding a rolled object. To his right, a standing figure, likely male, with a beard and wearing a hat, is also gesturing. Facing him is a woman, also gesturing, with her head covered by a veil. Several other figures are visible in the background, some wearing hats. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element above, suggesting an interior space or a covered area. The overall impression is one of a discussion or a narrative moment.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too generalized to definitively interpret a specific religious or biblical event. It appears to depict a group of people engaged in conversation or a transaction, possibly within a domestic or public setting. Without further context or identifying attributes, a precise interpretation is not possible.",
