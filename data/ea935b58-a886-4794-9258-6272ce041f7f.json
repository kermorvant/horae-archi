    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female figure, likely a saint or queen, stands holding a wheel and a palm frond. She is depicted with a halo and wears a flowing robe. To her left, a kneeling figure in armor, possibly a knight or a supplicant, looks up at her. Behind the kneeling figure is a banner with heraldic symbols. The scene is set against a grid-like background, with decorative borders framing the image. A blue curtain hangs in the background to the right. The overall impression is one of reverence and divine authority.",
