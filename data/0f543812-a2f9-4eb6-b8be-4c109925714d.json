    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with short, curly hair and a beard is depicted drinking from a vessel held to his mouth with his right hand. He wears a simple, draped garment. In his left hand, he holds a staff or club. The scene appears to be set within an architectural frame, suggested by the dark, vertical elements on either side, which might represent columns or decorative borders. The overall impression is of a solitary figure engaged in a basic act of sustenance.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a figure from the Old Testament, possibly representing a period of hardship or a specific narrative where drinking is a significant action. Without further context or clearer iconography, a precise identification is difficult. It could represent a general theme of human need or a specific biblical event.",
