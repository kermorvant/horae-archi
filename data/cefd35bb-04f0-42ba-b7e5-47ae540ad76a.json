    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Kiss of Judas, a pivotal moment in the Passion of Christ. Jesus, identifiable by his halo, is surrounded by a group of men. One man, presumably Judas, is embracing Jesus and kissing him, while others, some armed with clubs, surround them, appearing to apprehend Jesus. A figure kneels at the bottom left, possibly a disciple or a bystander. The background features architectural elements suggesting an interior space, with arched structures and decorative motifs.",
