    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a table-like structure. In the foreground, a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, cradles a baby. To her left, a bearded man wearing a conical hat with a dangling ornament holds his hands near the baby. Behind them, several other figures, including a man with a tall headdress and another woman with a veiled head, are visible. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting suggested by an arched canopy above and a decorative element resembling a small altar or pedestal in the lower left. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene, possibly the Presentation of Christ or a similar event involving the Holy Family and other significant individuals.",
