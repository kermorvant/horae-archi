    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two male figures seated within a large, ornate initial 'Q' or 'O'. The figure on the left, dressed in a dark robe, holds a book and gestures with his right hand. The figure on the right, also in a dark robe, holds a book in his lap and raises his right hand in a gesture of teaching or blessing. Above and between them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends. The background is dark and speckled with small circles, suggesting a celestial or abstract setting. To the right of the initial, a vertical band of text is presented in decorative, capital letters, arranged in four horizontal registers. This illumination likely represents a theological or biblical scene, possibly Christ teaching his disciples or a representation of the Trinity.",
