    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with Christ's body being held by a man, likely Joseph of Arimathea, while another man stands behind them. A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, kneels in supplication, her hands clasped. The figures are rendered in a woodcut style, with strong outlines and hatching to indicate form and shadow. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element, suggesting a setting within a building or a symbolic representation of a sacred space. The overall composition conveys a sense of sorrow and reverence.",
