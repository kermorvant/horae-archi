    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts God the Father, crowned and with a long white beard, holding the body of Christ. Christ is shown with a crown of thorns, wounds on his body, and a bloodied loincloth. He is being cradled by God the Father, with his head bowed and eyes closed. Behind them, a landscape with rolling hills and trees is visible through a window or opening. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with flat colors and minimal shading. The overall impression is one of sorrow and divine compassion.",
