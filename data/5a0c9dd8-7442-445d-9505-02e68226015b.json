    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a winged figure, likely an angel, standing to the left and holding a large red book. The angel has blonde hair and wears a golden robe over a white garment. To the right, a man in a red hat and clerical robes, possibly a bishop or cardinal, is seated and writing in a book placed on a lectern. He has a halo indicating sanctity. The background features classical-style architecture with columns and arches, and a green, patterned curtain hangs behind the seated figure. The floor is tiled with geometric patterns. The overall impression is one of a sacred or scholarly moment, possibly the dictation of scripture or a divine revelation.",
