    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral or memorial service within an interior space. A blue-draped sarcophagus is prominently placed in the foreground. To the left, a figure in a black habit, likely a nun or mourner, stands with their head bowed in grief. To the right, a group of three figures, two men and one woman, are gathered around a raised platform. One man, wearing a cap, reads from a book placed on a green cloth. Another figure, possibly a cleric, leans over a book on the platform. The background features a richly patterned tapestry or wall hanging. The overall atmosphere suggests a solemn occasion of mourning and remembrance.",
