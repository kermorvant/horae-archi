    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man wearing a pink robe and a crown stands on the left, gesturing with his hands. Facing him on the right is a crowned woman, also with a halo, dressed in a blue robe and a golden mantle. She holds a staff topped with a red banner and a cross, and in her other hand, she holds a chalice containing a white host. Behind her stand two men, one with a beard and the other with a white cap. The background features a decorative blue tapestry with golden foliage. The scene is set on a green ground.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts Saint Helena presenting the True Cross or a relic to a king, possibly Constantine the Great, or a symbolic representation of royalty. The chalice with the host could also allude to the Eucharist or a specific saintly attribute.",
