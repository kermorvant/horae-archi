    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle and purple robe, cradles the lifeless body of Christ, who is shown pale and wounded, wrapped in a white loincloth. To Mary's left, a young man, likely John the Evangelist, supports Christ's legs. To Mary's right, a woman in a yellow robe, possibly Mary Magdalene, kneels in prayer. Behind them, a wooden cross is visible, and the background features a green, hilly landscape with trees and a distant city skyline under a blue sky. The overall composition conveys sorrow and devotion.",
