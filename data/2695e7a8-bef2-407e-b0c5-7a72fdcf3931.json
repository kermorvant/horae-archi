    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures, predominantly in monastic attire, moves across a cobblestone ground. In the foreground, two monks in dark habits with white undergarments stand prominently. One holds a red book, while the other stands beside a young acolyte in a white robe holding a tall banner with a flame-like finial. Behind them, a group of figures, including women in wimples and hooded cloaks, observe the procession. In the background, simplified representations of buildings with red roofs and light-colored walls suggest an urban or ecclesiastical setting.",
