    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint, stands holding a censer. She has a halo, indicating her sanctity. The background is filled with a dotted pattern, suggesting a stylized representation of space or perhaps a textile. Above her, an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative tracery frames the scene. The figure's drapery is rendered with strong, angular folds. The overall impression is of a devotional image, possibly depicting a saint associated with worship or prayer.",
