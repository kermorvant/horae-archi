    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a pastoral landscape under a bright blue sky. On the left, a figure in an orange robe with gold trim stands, facing right. To their right, a figure in a blue robe kneels, looking upwards with an open mouth. Further to the right, three more figures are depicted, two in orange robes and one in blue, all kneeling and facing towards the left. A dark, abstract shape resembling a fallen animal or object lies on the ground between the kneeling figures. The background is a stylized representation of rolling green hills with some darker, rocky formations and sparse vegetation. The overall impression is one of a devotional or narrative scene set outdoors.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a moment from the life of Christ or a saint, possibly a miracle or a teaching. The kneeling figures suggest supplication or reverence, while the standing figure might be a divine messenger or a central character. The open mouth of the kneeling figure in blue could indicate astonishment, prayer, or speaking. Without further context or identifying attributes, a precise interpretation is difficult, but it evokes a sense of spiritual encounter in a natural setting.",
