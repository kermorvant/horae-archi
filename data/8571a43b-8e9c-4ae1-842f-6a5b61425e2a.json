    "scene_description_enriched": "Three young men are depicted gathered around a table, engaged in a game of dice. The man on the left, wearing a red tunic and blue hose, is in the process of rolling the dice. The central figure, in a blue tunic and red hat adorned with gold, looks intently at the dice. To the right, another young man in a red tunic and blue hat observes the game. The background suggests an indoor setting with architectural elements resembling columns and arches, though rendered schematically. A draped garment hangs over the back of a chair on the right side of the scene. The overall impression is one of casual leisure and perhaps a touch of anxiety or anticipation associated with gambling.",
