    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with blonde hair, wearing a pink robe over a blue garment, is depicted in prayer with her hands clasped. She is seated on a fantastical creature that resembles a dragon or a winged beast, colored in shades of grey and brown. The creature has a long tail, wings, and appears to be resting. The background is a flat, vibrant green, suggesting an outdoor or perhaps a symbolic setting. The overall composition is simple, focusing on the figure and the creature.",
