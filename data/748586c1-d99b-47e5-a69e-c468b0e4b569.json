    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, is depicted seated on a grassy knoll, dressed in a blue robe and a red cloak lined with gold. She holds a scroll with text and is looking down at it. To her left, a golden eagle stands, also looking towards the scroll. The background features rolling green hills dotted with trees, a body of water, and distant architectural structures that suggest a city or town. To the right, a rocky outcrop and more vegetation are visible. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
