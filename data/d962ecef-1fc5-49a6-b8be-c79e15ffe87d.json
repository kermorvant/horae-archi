    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Pietà, with God the Father holding the body of Christ, who is shown bleeding and wrapped in a white loincloth. Christ's head rests on God the Father's shoulder, and his halo is golden. God the Father, depicted as an elderly man with a beard and wearing a crown and ornate robes of red and blue, supports Christ. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is visible above Christ's head. To the left, a figure in a white robe and a golden cap, possibly Joseph of Arimathea or a disciple, holds the cross, which bears the inscription 'INRI'. Another figure in a white robe and cap stands behind him. To the right, a figure in a white robe and cap looks on. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or heavenly setting, with a decorative arch above framing the figures and a border of floral motifs. The overall impression is one of sorrowful reverence and divine contemplation of Christ's sacrifice.",
