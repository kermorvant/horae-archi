    "scene_description_enriched": "A young man with curly blond hair, rosy cheeks, and red lips stands in a blue tunic and green hose. He is framed by a decorative architectural element, possibly a stylized archway or niche, with red and blue accents and small orange floral motifs. The background is a shimmering gold leaf, suggesting a divine or precious setting. The figure's posture is open, with arms extended slightly outwards, and his gaze is directed forward.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a saint or a devotional figure, possibly representing youth or innocence. The gold background is typical of religious manuscripts, signifying a sacred or heavenly realm. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or liturgical event cannot be definitively identified.",
