    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle, standing and reaching out to Elizabeth, who is kneeling. Elizabeth, wearing a dark habit and a white veil, is shown with her hands clasped. Both figures have golden halos, indicating their sanctity. The background features a rocky outcrop and a distant cityscape with towers and walls, under a starry blue sky from which rays emanate from a sun-like source. The landscape is sparsely populated with stylized trees.",
