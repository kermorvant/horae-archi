    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, likely a saint or a devout woman, stands with her head slightly tilted and her gaze directed forward. She has long, blonde hair and wears a blue garment beneath a flowing red mantle. In her left hand, she holds an open book, its pages filled with text. Her right hand is clenched. To her right, a tall, grey architectural element, possibly a column or a pilaster, is visible, suggesting an interior or semi-exterior setting. The background is a flat green, with a suggestion of a patterned floor beneath her feet.",
