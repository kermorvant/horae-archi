    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe and white veil, tenderly holds the Christ Child. Three Magi, distinguished by their rich attire and headwear, approach to offer gifts. One kneels before Mary, presenting a golden vessel, while another, dressed in blue and gold, holds a similar offering. The third Magus, depicted with darker skin and wearing a striped robe, also carries a gift. Behind them, other figures observe the scene. The architecture is rudimentary, suggesting a stable with a thatched roof and wooden supports, with an opening revealing a glimpse of the outdoors.",
