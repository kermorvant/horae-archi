    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, where the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, is greeted by her cousin Elizabeth, who wears a white veil and a pink gown. Mary's hand rests on her pregnant belly, and Elizabeth's hand is placed on Mary's abdomen in a gesture of recognition and blessing. To the left, a young woman in a red dress holds a blue cloth. The background features a rolling landscape with trees and distant buildings, including a castle-like structure with spires and a windmill on a hill. The overall scene is bathed in the golden light of a radiant sun or divine presence in the upper sky.",
