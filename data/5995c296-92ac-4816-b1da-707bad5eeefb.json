    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling on the ground, blindfolded with a white cloth, and wearing a blue robe. He is being struck with a whip by another man. Behind him, several figures observe the scene, one of whom is praying with clasped hands. In the background, a classical-style building with columns and arches is visible. The overall impression is one of suffering and persecution, likely representing a biblical martyrdom.",
