    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and central placement, gesturing with his right hand towards a man kneeling before him, who is partially submerged in a dark sarcophagus-like structure. Christ is surrounded by a group of disciples, some with halos. To the left, a woman in a yellow gown and blue mantle kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Behind the main figures, a complex of stone buildings with blue-tiled roofs and towers, resembling a castle or fortified city, forms the backdrop. A pathway leads towards an arched gateway within these structures, where a figure in a red coat stands. The overall setting is outdoors, with green ground and a tree.",
