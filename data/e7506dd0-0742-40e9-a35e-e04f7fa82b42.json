    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman kneeling with her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a crown and elaborate clothing. Behind her, three men are gathered. One man, with a beard, stands to the left, holding a flower-like object. Two other men are positioned behind him, with one whispering into the ear of the other. In the background, architectural elements suggest a town or city with buildings and towers. The presence of a spinning wheel near the kneeling woman is notable. This scene likely represents Saint Catherine of Alexandria, known for her martyrdom involving a breaking wheel and her intellectual debates with philosophers.",
