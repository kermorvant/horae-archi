    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, lying on a bed covered with a richly decorated cloth, holds the Christ Child. Joseph stands behind her, supporting the Child. Three figures, identified as the Magi, approach from the right, one of them presenting a gift. A group of onlookers, all with halos, are gathered around the central figures. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a green, uneven ground suggesting a natural landscape.",
