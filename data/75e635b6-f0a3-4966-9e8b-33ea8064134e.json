    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation of a child, likely the Christ Child, on a stone altar or table. The child is held by a woman, presumably the Virgin Mary, who is seated. To her left stands another woman, possibly a companion or attendant, holding a basket and a candle. To the right of the altar stands an older man with a beard, likely Joseph, who appears to be receiving or observing the child. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sacred status. The setting is framed by a decorative border with floral motifs and geometric patterns, suggesting it is an illustration within a manuscript. The checkered pattern on the floor beneath the altar adds to the architectural context.",
