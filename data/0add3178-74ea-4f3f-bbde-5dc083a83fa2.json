    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious service within an interior space. Four clerics are present. Three are gathered around a large lectern, one of whom appears to be reading from a book, while the other two look on attentively. A fourth cleric, dressed in more ornate vestments and a mitre, stands separately with his hands clasped in prayer. To the right, an altar is visible, adorned with a chalice and an open book. Above the altar, a niche contains a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child. The architecture features ribbed vaults, brick walls, and a large window with tracery. The floor is tiled in a geometric pattern. The overall impression is one of solemn devotion and liturgical practice.",
