    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an interior space, possibly a hall or chamber. On the left, a man identified as Christ, wearing a purple robe with gold embellishments, stands with his hands bound. He is surrounded by other men, some in armor and one with a green cap and beard. On the right, a regal figure, likely a king or high-ranking official, sits on a throne draped with red and gold fabric. This figure, wearing a crown and a blue and gold robe, is shown pouring water from a ewer into a basin held by another attendant. The presence of bound hands and the act of washing suggest a scene of judgment or trial, likely related to the Passion of Christ.",
