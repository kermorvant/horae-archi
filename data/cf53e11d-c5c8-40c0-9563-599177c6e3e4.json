    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a group of four haloed figures, likely saints, clustered together. The central figure, a young person, holds a small, round object in their hands. They are dressed in a patterned robe over a white garment. To their left, a bearded figure wears a dark robe and has a solemn expression. To the right of the central figure, two other individuals are partially visible, also with halos, suggesting their sanctity. The background is plain, with no discernible architectural or landscape elements, focusing attention entirely on the figures.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a gathering of saints, possibly in contemplation or veneration. The central figure holding a round object could be a representation of a saint associated with a relic or a specific devotional item, though without further context, the exact identity and meaning of the object remain ambiguous. The presence of multiple haloed figures strongly suggests a religious context, possibly a depiction of a communion of saints or a specific devotional scene.",
