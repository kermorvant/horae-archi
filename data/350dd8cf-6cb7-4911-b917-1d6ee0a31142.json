    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the arrest of Jesus. Jesus, wearing a blue and pink robe, is being embraced by Judas, who is dressed in a golden-brown robe. Behind Judas, several soldiers in armor and helmets are present, one of whom is reaching out to grasp Jesus. To the left, a man in a pink and gold tunic, also wearing a helmet, is falling to his knees, dropping a sword. Another figure, possibly Peter, stands to the far left, holding a large sword and looking distressed. The background shows a wooden fence or palisade, and to the right, a decorative architectural element, possibly part of a frame or a building facade, is visible. The overall setting appears to be outdoors.",
