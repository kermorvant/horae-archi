    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is seated and reading from an open book, her hands clasped in prayer. She wears a veil and a draped garment. To her right stands a man, identifiable as Christ, with a beard and long hair, also with a halo. He gestures with his hands, seemingly in discourse with the woman. Behind them, a large window with diamond-shaped panes is visible. The architectural elements suggest an interior space, possibly a room within a house or a chapel, with an arched structure overhead. In the background, to the right, a stylized representation of buildings with towers can be seen, hinting at a city or settlement.",
