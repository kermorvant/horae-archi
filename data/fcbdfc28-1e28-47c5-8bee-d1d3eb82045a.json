    "scene_description_enriched": "Two birds, one with blue plumage and the other with brown and grey, are depicted in a grassy area. The blue bird is bending down to peck at the ground, while the brown bird stands upright with its head tilted upwards. The scene is framed by an elaborate decorative border featuring stylized floral motifs and small, dark insect-like figures. The overall impression is one of naturalistic observation within a decorative context.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a decorative motif rather than a specific biblical or devotional event. The inclusion of birds and foliage is common in medieval manuscripts for aesthetic purposes, often symbolizing nature, creation, or the beauty of the divine world.",
