The man on the right wears a red robe and a blue mantle, and has a golden halo. Behind them, architectural elements suggest a building with arches and niches containing figures. To the right of the man on the right, a bull is depicted. The scene likely represents a biblical or prophetic moment, possibly related to the Evangelists or Old Testament prophets.",
