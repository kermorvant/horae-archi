    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king, clad in ornate golden armor and a blue mantle, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. Behind him, to the left, stands a grand classical building with columns and a pediment. In the middle ground, a landscape unfolds with a group of tents and soldiers, and in the distance, a city with prominent towers and spires is visible under a blue sky. A beam of light descends from above, illuminating the praying figure. The scene likely depicts a moment of divine intervention or supplication, possibly related to a military campaign or a significant royal event.",
