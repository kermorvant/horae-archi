    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in an indoor setting, likely a dining room. On the left, a person, possibly a woman, is seated at a table covered with a white tablecloth. They are wearing a headdress and a dark garment, and their hands are engaged with objects on the table, including a cup and a plate. On the right, another figure, likely a man, stands and holds a platter with food. This figure wears a patterned cloak over a tunic and a headdress. The background suggests an interior space with architectural elements such as columns and what appears to be a draped curtain or tapestry. The overall impression is a domestic scene of dining or serving food.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a secular event, possibly a depiction of daily life or a specific narrative from a non-biblical source, given the absence of overt religious iconography. It could be illustrating a scene from a romance, a historical account, or a moralizing tale.",
