    "scene_description_enriched": "A winged figure, likely an angel, is depicted in a reclining or falling posture, with one arm supporting its head and the other extended. The figure appears to be wearing a tunic and possibly a cape. Below the figure, several sheep are visible, suggesting a pastoral setting. The background is abstract, with wavy lines and some rocky formations, and a vertical element that could be a tree or a column on the left. The overall impression is one of a celestial being interacting with the earthly realm, possibly in a moment of contemplation or descent.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts an angel, possibly in a moment of divine intervention or contemplation, interacting with a flock of sheep. This could relate to themes of divine protection, pastoral care, or a moment of revelation. Without further context, a specific biblical event is difficult to pinpoint, but it evokes imagery of angels in earthly settings, common in devotional art.",
