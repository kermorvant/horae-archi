    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth. Blood is visible on his body. To the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle and white veil, looks up at Christ with her hands clasped. To the right, a figure, likely John the Evangelist, in a red robe, also gazes upwards with hands clasped. The background features a green, grassy ground and a pale blue sky with a distant cityscape. The entire scene is framed by a golden border and an arched top.",
