    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male figure, likely a saint or prophet, is depicted frontally. He wears a green tunic and a blue mantle adorned with gold patterns. His right hand is raised, index finger pointing upwards, while his left hand grips a staff topped with a blue, cross-like finial. A golden halo surrounds his head. Behind him, vertical lines suggest a rudimentary architectural setting, possibly a wall or columns, rendered in muted tones.",
