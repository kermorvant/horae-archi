    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Jesus, identified by his halo and beard, interacting with a kneeling figure. Jesus is gesturing with his right hand, palm outward, and pointing with his left. The kneeling figure, likely a woman based on her attire and posture, reaches out towards Jesus. Behind Jesus, two other figures are visible, one with a halo, suggesting they are also significant religious figures. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative carving, and behind the figures, a background suggests an interior space with vertical elements that could be pillars or window mullions. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine interaction or healing.",
