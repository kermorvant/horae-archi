    "scene_description_enriched": "A winged figure, likely an angel, is depicted on the left, facing right. The angel appears to be in profile, with a helmet-like head covering and a body adorned with patterned fabric. To the right of the angel, a woman is shown in prayer, her hands clasped together. She wears a head covering and a garment with vertical stripes. The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting a spiritual or otherworldly setting. The scene likely represents the Annunciation, where the Angel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary that she will conceive Jesus.",
