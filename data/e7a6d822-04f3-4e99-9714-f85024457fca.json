    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with rolling hills, scattered sheep, and sparse trees. In the foreground, a shepherd in a red tunic and blue trousers sits on the ground, looking upwards with an expression of awe or surprise. To his left, another shepherd stands, playing a bagpipe and looking towards the sky. Above them, an angel with outstretched wings and a golden halo descends from a bright, cloud-filled sky, gesturing with one hand. The overall impression is one of a divine revelation or visitation occurring in a rural setting.",
