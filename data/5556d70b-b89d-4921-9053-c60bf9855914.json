    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely Saint Joseph, holds the Christ Child in his arms. Saint Joseph wears a green robe draped with a pink sash and holds a staff. The Christ Child, dressed in a blue tunic, reaches out with one hand and holds a golden orb in the other. Behind them, a landscape with rolling hills is visible, and a haloed figure, possibly the Virgin Mary, is depicted in the background. The scene is framed by a golden border and a decorative column on the left.",
