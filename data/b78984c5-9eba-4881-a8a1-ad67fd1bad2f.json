    "scene_description_enriched": "A solitary female figure, clad in a vibrant red robe, is depicted within a series of concentric, layered circles. The innermost circle appears to be a representation of the Earth, with textured brown and grey tones. Surrounding this are bands of blue and lighter hues, suggesting celestial spheres or cosmic layers. The figure's gaze is directed downwards, and her posture is somewhat introspective. To the right, a stylized tree with dark foliage stands against a muted background, and to the left, a similar, though less distinct, tree or shrub is visible. The overall impression is one of a spiritual or cosmic setting, possibly illustrating a theological concept or a moment of divine revelation.",
