    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two parts by a prominent red column. On the left, a crowned king, identified by the inscription \"DAVID\" on his robe, stands gesturing towards a group of figures. One figure, dressed in blue and holding a book, appears to be reading or singing, accompanied by two other individuals. Behind them, an architectural structure with green columns and arched windows is visible. On the right, a construction scene unfolds. Several figures are engaged in building a structure, with scaffolding and wooden beams. One figure in blue is digging, while another in red and blue is hammering a stone. A wooden coffin-like structure is also present. The overall scene depicts both a royal or religious gathering and manual labor, possibly related to construction or burial.",
