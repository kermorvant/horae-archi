    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed women in conversation, set within a verdant landscape. The woman on the left wears a blue robe with gold trim, while the woman on the right is clad in a pinkish-brown robe and a white veil. They are positioned on a path, with lush green foliage and trees surrounding them. In the background, a city with numerous buildings, towers, and spires is visible, nestled amongst rolling hills. The overall impression is one of a serene, pastoral setting with a distant urban backdrop. The interaction between the two women, likely Mary and Elizabeth, suggests a moment of shared joy or spiritual communion.",
