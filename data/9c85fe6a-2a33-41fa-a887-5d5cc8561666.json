    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king, identified by his crown and regal attire, with a beard and a pensive expression, touching his face. He stands to the right, facing left. To his left, two young figures, one in pink and the other in blue, look upwards with hands outstretched towards the king. Further to the left, two monks in dark grey habits with tonsured heads are also present, one gesturing with his hands. The background is a vibrant, tessellated pattern of gold, blue, and red squares, with golden rays emanating from the top, suggesting a divine or celestial presence. The figures are situated on a green, grassy ground with stylized plants. This scene likely represents a moment of divine revelation or intercession, possibly involving the king receiving a vision or counsel.",
