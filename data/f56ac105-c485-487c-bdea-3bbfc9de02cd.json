    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Betrayal of Christ, with Judas Iscariot kissing Jesus, identifying him to the soldiers who are apprehending him. Jesus, in a dark robe, is surrounded by armed men in armor and helmets. One soldier, in red armor, grasps Jesus's arm. Another soldier, in golden armor, embraces Jesus. In the foreground, a man in a blue tunic kneels, reaching out towards Jesus, possibly representing a follower or a witness. The background is a starry night sky, suggesting the event takes place at night. The overall impression is one of chaos and violence.",
