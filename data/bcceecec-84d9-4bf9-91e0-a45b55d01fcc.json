In the foreground, a flock of sheep grazes, accompanied by a dog. Two shepherds, one kneeling and looking upwards with clasped hands, and another reaching out towards a seated woman, are present. The woman, dressed in a blue gown, holds a lamb. Above them, an angel with wings outstretched hovers, unfurling a scroll that reads \"Gloria in excelsis Deo\". The background features rolling hills and a rocky outcrop.",
