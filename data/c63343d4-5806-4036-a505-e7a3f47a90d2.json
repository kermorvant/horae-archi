    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Luke the Evangelist, identifiable by his halo and the presence of his symbol, the ox, kneeling and writing in a large book. He is seated within an architectural setting that appears to be a study or scriptorium, characterized by columns, arches, and a window with tracery. Above him, a timber-framed structure with small windows is visible, suggesting an upper level or a more complex building. The ox, also with a halo, is positioned to the right of Saint Luke, looking towards him. The overall composition is framed by decorative foliage at the top.",
