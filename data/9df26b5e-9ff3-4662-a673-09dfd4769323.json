    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation ceremony, likely the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A bearded man, possibly a priest or Simeon, wearing a red crown and white robe over a red garment, holds the Christ Child aloft. The Christ Child is depicted as a nude infant with outstretched arms. Before him, a woman in a blue mantle and veil, identified as the Virgin Mary, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. To the right, another woman in a red dress, possibly a prophetess or attendant, stands holding a small object, perhaps a dove or fruit. The figures are positioned in front of a raised, white altar-like structure with red trim. Behind the figures is a decorative, tiled background within an arched frame, and the scene is bordered by foliate motifs. The ground is depicted as green.",
