    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Jerome in the wilderness, seated and writing on a scroll, illuminated by divine light descending from a bust of God in a radiant halo above. To his left, a golden eagle, possibly symbolizing the evangelist John or a divine messenger, holds inkwells and a quill. To his right, a demon with a staff lurks menacingly. In the background, a river flows past rocky hills and lush greenery. Further in the distance, three figures are engaged in conversation on a rocky outcrop, with a walled city or castle visible on the horizon. The overall composition suggests a moment of spiritual contemplation and struggle against temptation.",
