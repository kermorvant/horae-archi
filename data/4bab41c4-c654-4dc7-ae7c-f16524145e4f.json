    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, wearing a distinctive hat and a richly decorated robe, is seated and holding open a large book. His hands are positioned as if reading or studying the text. To his right, a second figure, also robed, is partially visible, facing away from the viewer. The background is a muted grey, suggesting an indoor or perhaps a stylized setting. The ground beneath the figures is depicted as green, with a hint of blue at the bottom edge, possibly representing grass or a landscape.",
