He holds a scythe with a long handle, its blade curved and sharp. Behind him, a rustic wooden fence encloses the field, and beyond that, a village or townscape unfolds with several buildings featuring pitched roofs and spires. Small, stylized trees dot the landscape. The scene is framed within an ornate border with foliate motifs.",
