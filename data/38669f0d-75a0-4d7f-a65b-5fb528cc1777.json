    "scene_description_enriched": "A regal figure, likely a king or emperor, is depicted seated on an ornate, green-cushioned throne. He wears a richly decorated crown and a blue mantle over a white tunic adorned with a black cross pattern. In his right hand, he holds a scepter, and in his left, a book or scroll. The background is a vibrant red with intricate gold ornamentation, suggesting a lavish setting. The throne itself is elaborate, with architectural elements suggesting a canopy or a structured enclosure. The floor is tiled in a black and white diamond pattern. The overall impression is one of power, authority, and religious significance, possibly representing a royal saint or a king in a devotional context.",
