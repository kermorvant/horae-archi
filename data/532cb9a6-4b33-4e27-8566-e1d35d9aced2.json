    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael the Archangel, clad in armor, standing triumphantly over a defeated demon. Saint Michael holds a sword raised high, ready to strike, and a shield. The demon lies prostrate beneath his feet, appearing defeated and perhaps in pain. The background is a barren landscape with some rocky formations and sparse vegetation, suggesting an earthly or perhaps infernal setting. The entire scene is framed by an arched border, typical of manuscript illumination.",
