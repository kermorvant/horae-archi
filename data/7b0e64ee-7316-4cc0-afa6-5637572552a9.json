    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, dressed in an orange robe, gesturing towards the Virgin Mary on the right. Mary, in a blue mantle and dark dress, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, looking downwards. Above them, the Holy Spirit is represented as a white dove descending with rays of light. In the background, a group of figures, possibly prophets or apostles, are visible behind a balustrade. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the architectural elements and drapery.",
