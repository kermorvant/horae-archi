    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral outdoor setting, three shepherds are depicted. Two stand and one kneels, all looking upwards towards a celestial vision. Above them, an angel appears on a cloud, radiating light. The shepherds are tending to a flock of sheep, some of which are visible in the background. The scene likely represents the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a pivotal moment in the Nativity narrative where angels announce the birth of Christ to humble shepherds.",
