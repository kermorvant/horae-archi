    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, cloaked and veiled, kneels to the left, looking down with a gentle expression. Before her lies the Christ Child, swaddled and resting on the ground. To the right, Joseph, an elderly man with a long beard, kneels and looks towards the child. Behind Joseph, three figures, possibly shepherds or wise men, are gathered, one holding a staff. The background features a dark, tent-like structure on the left, suggesting a humble dwelling, and a landscape with stylized trees and hills on the right, under a radiant sky with emanating rays of light. The overall composition suggests a solemn and reverent moment of the birth of Christ.",
