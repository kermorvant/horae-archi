    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and holding the Christ Child, is sheltered by a simple wooden structure with a thatched roof. A figure in a red cloak stands behind Mary. Three Magi approach, one kneeling and presenting a golden casket, while another stands holding a golden staff and wearing a crown. The third Magus is partially visible behind the second. The setting is outdoors, with rolling hills, trees, and a blue sky with golden stars and a radiant sun. A crown lies on the grassy ground in the foreground.",
