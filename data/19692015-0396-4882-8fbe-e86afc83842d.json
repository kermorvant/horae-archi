    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal court setting where a king, seated on a throne and adorned with a crown and regal blue robes, gestures with his right hand. Before him, a procession of individuals presents offerings. One man, dressed in green, carries a basket of loaves on his head. Another, in blue, holds out a loaf of bread to a supplicant dressed in brown, who is kneeling. To the right, a woman cradles a baby, and other figures observe the scene. In the background, architectural elements suggest an interior space with arched windows and decorative columns. Above, a small vignette shows a figure, possibly a saint or divine being, in a celestial setting.",
