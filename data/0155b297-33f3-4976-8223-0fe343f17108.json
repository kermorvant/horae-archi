    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is a still life composition featuring several human skulls and bones arranged on a grassy ground. In the upper right, a plump infant lies asleep, with an hourglass beside it. The inscription \"MORS OMNIA ÆQVAT\" (Death makes all equal) is visible in the upper left corner. The overall impression is a meditation on mortality and the ephemeral nature of life, contrasting the innocence of infancy with the inevitability of death.",
