    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure seated at a table laden with food, including a bowl filled with what appears to be fruit or vegetables. The figure is wearing a red tunic and a blue mantle, with a head covering. To the left of the figure is a goblet, and to the right, a jug. The background is a textured orange, suggesting an indoor setting or a stylized representation of one. The figure's hands are raised, one holding a round object, possibly bread or fruit, and the other pointing upwards, perhaps in prayer or blessing. This scene likely represents a meal, possibly a devotional meal or a depiction of a saint at table.",
