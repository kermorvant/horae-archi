    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with radiant wings and a golden halo descends from the sky, gesturing towards a man kneeling in prayer. The man, clad in armor and a blue cloak, holds a helmet in his left hand and a staff with a red flag in his right. He looks up at the angel with an expression of supplication. To his left, a quadruped, possibly a dog or a lion, lies on the ground. The scene is set in a hilly, green landscape with trees and a distant church spire. The overall composition suggests a divine revelation or a moment of spiritual guidance.",
