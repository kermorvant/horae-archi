    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a saintly figure, identifiable by his halo and episcopal vestments, standing in an interior space. He wears a pink cope over a green dalmatic and holds a book and a cleaver. The room is furnished with a bed, draped with rich textiles, and a wooden structure that might be a chest or another piece of furniture. The background features a wall with three arched windows and a wooden ceiling structure. The overall impression is of a domestic or monastic chamber, possibly representing a moment in the life of a martyr.",
