    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned male figure, likely a king, is depicted in profile, looking to the right. He wears a tunic and has long, wavy hair. His left hand is placed over his chest, and his right hand is not clearly visible. The figure is framed by architectural elements, including a column on the left and an arched structure above, suggesting he is within an interior space. The background is filled with a dotted pattern, possibly representing a tapestry or a decorative wall.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The image depicts a royal figure, possibly representing a king from the Old Testament or a secular ruler. Without further context or iconography, a specific religious interpretation is not possible, but it could be part of a series illustrating royal lineage or historical events.",
