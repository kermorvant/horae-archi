    "scene_description_enriched": "In this scene, Christ, depicted with a halo and wearing a reddish-brown robe, is shown reaching out to touch a pale, emaciated figure lying in a wooden sarcophagus or bed. This figure, draped in white, appears to be ill or deceased. Christ's gesture suggests an act of healing or resurrection. Behind Christ, a group of figures with halos, likely apostles or disciples, observe with hands clasped in prayer or awe. To the right, a group of women, also with halos, are present, some with hands joined in prayer, witnessing the event. In the background, a richly decorated architectural structure, possibly a tomb or a symbolic representation of a building, is visible. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a green landscape and a blue sky.",
