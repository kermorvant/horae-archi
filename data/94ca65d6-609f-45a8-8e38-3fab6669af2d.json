    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of Christ, shown from the chest up, wearing a crown of thorns and a red cloak draped over his shoulders. His body is bare and shows signs of scourging, with visible wounds and bloodstains. He holds a green reed in his hands, which are also marked with wounds. Christ's right hand is raised, palm outward, with a visible wound on his index finger. The background is a vibrant blue with scattered gold leaf motifs resembling flames or tears, possibly representing divine light or sorrow. The overall presentation suggests a devotional image focused on Christ's suffering and sacrifice.",
