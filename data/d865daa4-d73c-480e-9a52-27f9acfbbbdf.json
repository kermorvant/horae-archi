    "scene_description_enriched": "Two women, one holding a nude infant, stand in a barren landscape. The woman on the left, with long flowing hair, cradles the child. The woman on the right wears a wimple and veil, her hands clasped. The background is a muted wash of grey and white, suggesting a sky or distant hills, with no architectural elements present. The scene evokes a sense of quiet tenderness and maternal care, likely depicting a moment from the life of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child, possibly the Visitation or a similar devotional scene.",
