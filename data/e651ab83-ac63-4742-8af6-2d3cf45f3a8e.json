    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural setting. The figure on the right, larger and more prominent, wears a headdress and a richly decorated garment with circular motifs. This figure appears to be gesturing or holding something. To the left, a smaller figure is shown in profile, with hands clasped in prayer or supplication. The background is filled with a dense pattern of dots, suggesting foliage or a decorative textile. Above the figures, an arched structure, possibly a canopy or part of a building, is visible, adorned with leaf-like motifs. The overall impression is one of reverence or a devotional scene, possibly depicting a saint or a supplicant before a holy figure.",
