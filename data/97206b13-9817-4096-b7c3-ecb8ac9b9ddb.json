    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, depicted with a bald head and a determined expression, stands in a wooded area, raising a wooden club to strike. He is dressed in a pink tunic over a white undergarment and dark leggings. Around him, three wild boars are visible, one in the foreground and two behind. The setting is a verdant landscape with trees and a blue sky in the background, suggesting an outdoor hunting scene. The scene is framed by a decorative border, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
