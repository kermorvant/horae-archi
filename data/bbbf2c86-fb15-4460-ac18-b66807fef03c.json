    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural setting. On the left, an older man with a long white beard and a halo stands, holding a staff. He is richly robed in gold and red. To his right, a younger figure, possibly a cleric or acolyte, kneels with hands clasped, wearing a white surplice over a red garment. Behind them, the interior of a building is suggested by vertical lines and niches containing statuary. Through an arched opening on the left, a landscape with hills and a castle-like structure is visible. The floor is tiled with geometric patterns.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a devotional or biblical moment, possibly involving a saint or a figure from the Old Testament, given the halo and staff of the older man. The kneeling figure suggests prayer or supplication. The architectural elements and the landscape hint at a sacred or historical context.",
