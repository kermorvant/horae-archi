    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two parts by a column. On the left, a crowned figure, identified by the inscription \"DRUMD\" on their robe, stands in a richly decorated architectural setting. This figure, possibly King David, is depicted with a harp at their feet and appears contemplative. The architecture features pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and windows with tracery. On the right, a group of people, some with hands clasped in prayer, look upwards towards a celestial vision. Christ, depicted with stigmata, stands within a mandorla, flanked by angels. Below this divine manifestation, birds fly and animals, including a lion and a lamb, gaze upwards. The setting on the right is an outdoor landscape with green hills.",
