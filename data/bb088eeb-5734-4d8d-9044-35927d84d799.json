    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint, stands in a verdant landscape, holding a golden vessel. She is dressed in a golden undergarment and a flowing purple mantle. Behind her, a woven fence separates the foreground from a middle ground with rolling hills and scattered bushes. In the distance, a city with towers and walls is depicted, and on a hill to the left, a domed structure topped with a cross is visible. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure with a halo and holding a vessel is likely a female saint, possibly Mary Magdalene or another saint associated with carrying ointments or relics. The domed structure with a cross suggests a religious site, perhaps a church or a shrine, and the distant city could represent Jerusalem or a symbolic representation of a holy city.",
