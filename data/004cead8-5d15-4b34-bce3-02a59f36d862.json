    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, presenting him to a man reclining in a bed. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle over a golden tunic, cradles the infant. The man, presumably Saint Joseph, is shown with a long beard and blue hair, propped up in a bed with a red headboard. The background features a decorative tapestry-like pattern of gold, blue, and red diamonds. Above the scene, a stylized architectural element resembling a blue and white striped tower or canopy is visible, adorned with gold at its peak. The overall setting appears to be an interior space, possibly a domestic room, with decorative elements suggesting a rich setting.",
