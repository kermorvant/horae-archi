    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman with long, wavy hair and a serene expression stands with her hands clasped in prayer. She is positioned next to a monstrous, dragon-like creature with sharp teeth and claws, which appears to be subdued or controlled by her presence. The scene takes place indoors, within a room with a tiled floor. To the left, a tall, arched window with a grid pattern is visible, suggesting a prison or a monastic cell. To the right, a doorway leads to another dimly lit space. The overall composition suggests a narrative of spiritual triumph over evil or temptation.",
