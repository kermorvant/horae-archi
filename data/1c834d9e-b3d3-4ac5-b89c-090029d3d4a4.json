    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in a pink robe and crown, with a long beard, kneeling outdoors with his hands clasped in prayer. He is looking upwards towards a figure of Christ, who is depicted in the sky, gesturing with his right hand. To the left, a tall, imposing stone tower with crenellations and arched windows is visible. Through a barred window in the tower, several figures in red robes can be seen. The background features a lush green forest and distant blue mountains with a castle on a hilltop. The overall scene suggests a moment of divine intervention or supplication.",
