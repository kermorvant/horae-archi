    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by a crowd of figures. Christ, wearing a blue robe and a crown of thorns, struggles under the weight of a large wooden cross. To his left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, looks on with sorrow, her hands clasped. Behind them, a group of men in various colored tunics and helmets push forward. To Christ's right, a man in a brown tunic and red cap strikes him with a stick, while another figure in a pink tunic and green pouch runs ahead. A woman in a blue robe holds a white cloth. In the background, a city with pink walls and blue-roofed buildings, including towers and spires, is visible.",
