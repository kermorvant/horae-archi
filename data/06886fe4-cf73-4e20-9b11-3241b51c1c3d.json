    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bishop, identifiable by his mitre and vestments, standing in a richly decorated interior. He is gesturing with his right hand and holding a staff in his left. To his left, a group of figures, possibly representing the faithful or a specific biblical event, are depicted in a huddled mass. To his right, a figure in black, likely a monk or nun, kneels in prayer. The background features an arched architectural structure with windows, suggesting an ecclesiastical setting. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern, and the wall behind the figures is adorned with a red tapestry featuring gold ornamentation. The overall scene is framed by decorative floral elements and gold leaf, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
