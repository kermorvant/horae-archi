    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, identified as Saint Margaret of Antioch, is depicted seated on a dragon. She wears a red dress and a blue mantle, and holds a cross aloft. Above her, a dove descends from a blue, cloud-filled sky, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The dragon, with its mouth open and a blue cloth caught in its teeth, appears subdued. In the background, a body of water separates the foreground from a walled town with towers and blue-roofed buildings, set against a rolling green landscape dotted with trees. The scene is framed by an ornate border.",
