    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a sorrowful Christ, seated and bearing wounds from his crucifixion, including a prominent wound on his side and marks on his hands and feet. He is draped in a white cloth. Above and behind him, an angel with large, feathered wings gently places a hand on Christ's head, offering solace or perhaps a gesture of divine recognition. The background is a starry blue, suggesting a celestial or spiritual setting, framed by an arched architectural element that hints at a divine space. Below Christ is a raised platform or sarcophagus, adorned with decorative arches.",
