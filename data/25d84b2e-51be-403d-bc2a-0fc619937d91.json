    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures are depicted in a close-up view. The central figures are two men, one on the left with his arms crossed and a stern expression, and another on the right with his hands clasped in prayer or supplication. Behind them, other figures are visible, some with their hands raised. The figures are dressed in simple tunics and appear to be barefoot. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with bold outlines and minimal detail, suggesting a narrative or devotional context.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The image likely depicts a scene of supplication or judgment, possibly related to a biblical narrative or a devotional practice. The clasped hands and the varied expressions of the figures suggest an interaction involving pleading, confession, or seeking favor. Without further context, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of human interaction with a higher power or authority.",
