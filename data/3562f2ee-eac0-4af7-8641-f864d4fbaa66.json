    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession of figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a hooded figure, possibly a monk or nun, is shown in profile, with hands clasped. To their right, three men are grouped together. The central figure wears a helmet and holds a staff. The figure to his right has a beard and also holds a staff, with floral motifs visible behind them. On the far right, a crowned figure is depicted, holding what appears to be a swaddled infant. The figures are framed by architectural elements suggesting arches and decorative borders, with a dotted pattern filling the background spaces. The overall impression is one of a religious or royal procession, possibly depicting a biblical narrative or a scene of veneration.",
