    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a prominent rocky outcrop in the foreground. Two figures, an older man with a white beard and a younger man, are shown in conversation. The older man wears a brown hooded robe over a blue tunic, and the younger man wears a blue cloak over a purple garment and a distinctive brown hat. In the background, a shepherd tends to his flock near a rocky formation, and further in the distance, a town with buildings and a castle on a hill is visible. Above, a winged angel descends, holding a banner that reads 'GLORIA IN EXCELSIS' (Glory to God in the Highest), with rays of light emanating downwards. The overall impression is one of a divine announcement to humble shepherds.",
