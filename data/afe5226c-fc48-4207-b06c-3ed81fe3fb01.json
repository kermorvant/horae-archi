    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a beard and a hooded garment is depicted within an architectural setting. He is shown with his hands clasped together, holding something small. The architecture features a pointed arch above his head, decorated with what appear to be stylized birds or finials, and vertical elements that suggest a niche or a decorative architectural frame. The overall impression is of a devotional scene, possibly depicting a saint or a figure in prayer.",
