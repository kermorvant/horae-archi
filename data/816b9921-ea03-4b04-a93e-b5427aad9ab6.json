    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a domestic interior with three figures. On the left, a woman, likely the Virgin Mary, holds a haloed infant. To the right, another woman, possibly a midwife or attendant, is shown leaning over a cradle-like object, pouring liquid from a jug. A third figure, also with a halo, is partially visible behind the first woman, appearing to be in prayer or contemplation. The background suggests an architectural setting with an arched opening and interior walls, possibly a room within a house or stable.",
