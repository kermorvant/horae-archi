    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary cradling the body of Christ after the crucifixion. Mary, dressed in a blue mantle and veil, is seated and looks down with a sorrowful expression, her hands clasped. Christ's body, pale and marked with wounds, lies across her lap. The background is a stylized landscape with rolling hills, a body of water, and distant, indistinct structures that suggest a town or castle. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative floral elements.",
