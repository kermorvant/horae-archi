    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely a beggar or a sick individual, lying on the ground, partially covered by a white cloth. He is looking upwards with his arms crossed. Standing behind him are three figures: a man in a blue and red robe with a green hat, gesturing with his hand; a woman in a green dress; and another figure in a red robe and blue tunic. In the background, a fortified building with towers and orange roofs is visible, along with a wooden scaffolding structure. The overall setting appears to be outdoors, with a hint of a landscape and a bright, sun-like emanation in the sky.",
