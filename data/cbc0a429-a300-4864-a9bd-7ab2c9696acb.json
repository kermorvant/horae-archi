    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a simple wooden stable structure. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, looking down at the Christ Child who lies on a golden cloth on the green tiled floor. The Christ Child is depicted as a naked infant with a halo. To the right, Saint Joseph, with a white beard and wearing a pink robe over a blue garment, also kneels with his hands in prayer, leaning on a staff. Behind them, a donkey and a cow are visible within the stable. The background features a patterned tapestry and a landscape beyond. Rays of golden light emanate from above, illuminating the scene.",
