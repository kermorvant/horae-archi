    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with a flock of sheep grazing in a green field. Two shepherds are present: one seated and playing a pipe, dressed in red and blue robes with a yellow hood, and another standing, holding a staff and wearing a red and gold cloak over a gold tunic. Above them, in the sky, a winged angelic figure with multiple faces, possibly representing a choir of angels or a divine messenger, holds a scroll. In the background, rolling hills, trees, and distant structures, including a castle-like building, are visible under a blue sky. The overall impression is one of a peaceful, idyllic rural setting imbued with a divine presence.",
