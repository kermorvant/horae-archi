    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, wearing a headdress, cradles the Christ Child in her arms. Joseph, also wearing a headdress, is seated to the right, looking towards the child. Behind them, a woman, likely an attendant or midwife, leans over, possibly attending to Mary or the child. The figures are positioned within a simple architectural setting, suggested by a curved arch and striped background elements that could represent a stable or a room. The overall composition is rendered in a linear, woodcut-like style.",
