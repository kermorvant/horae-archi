    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel kneeling before the Virgin Mary, who is seated and reading a book. The angel, with large wings, gestures towards Mary, holding a staff topped with a fleur-de-lis and a cross. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, flies above them. In the background, a figure, possibly God the Father or a prophet, is visible through an arched opening, holding a sphere. The setting appears to be within an architectural frame, suggested by columns and decorative elements, with a dark, patterned background behind the figures.",
