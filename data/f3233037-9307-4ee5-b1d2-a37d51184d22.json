    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with rolling hills and scattered trees. Several shepherds, identifiable by their simple tunics and staffs, are shown looking upwards in awe. One shepherd points towards the sky, where a winged figure, likely an angel, is descending. The angel holds a scroll or ribbon in its hand, and appears to be addressing the shepherds. A flock of sheep grazes in the background, some near a small body of water. The scene is framed by an arched border adorned with gold leaf and intricate patterns, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
