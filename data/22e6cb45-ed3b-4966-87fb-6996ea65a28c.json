    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, some in blue and gold robes, others in yellow, are looking upwards towards a divine figure depicted in a red garment and halo, emanating golden rays. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of squares in red, blue, and gold. The figures are standing on a green grassy ground with small red flowers. The divine figure appears to be bestowing blessings or divine inspiration upon the supplicants. This scene likely represents a moment of divine revelation or prayer, possibly related to the Old Testament or a saint's vision.",
