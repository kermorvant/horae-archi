    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely a saint, stands frontally. He has a beard and long, dark hair. He wears a dark habit with vertical folds and a light blue mantle draped over his shoulders. A blue tau cross is visible on his mantle and on his habit. He holds a golden staff topped with a blue tau cross in his left hand and a red, closed book in his right. The background is a gradient of orange and red, suggesting a sky or a metaphysical space. The figure's gaze is directed downwards with a somber expression.",
