    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine manifestation with three figures at the center. The uppermost figure, an elder with a long white beard and halo, appears to be God the Father, clad in blue. He holds a haloed figure of Christ, depicted as a young man with a beard, also in red and holding a book. This central figure is surrounded by a golden, radiating halo. Below them, a group of men, likely apostles or prophets, gaze upwards in awe and prayer. They are dressed in robes of blue, red, and gold. The background is a rich tapestry of small, tessellated squares in black, red, and gold, suggesting a celestial or divine realm. The lower portion of the image shows a green ground with stylized plants.",
