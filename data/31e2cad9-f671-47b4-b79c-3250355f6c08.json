    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Michael, a winged warrior clad in golden armor and a blue pleated skirt, standing triumphantly over a blue dragon. He holds a sword raised in his right hand, poised to strike, and a lance in his left, which pierces the dragon. His eyes are closed in concentration or divine inspiration. In the background, a stylized, fantastical city with towers and spires rises against a blue sky. The ground is a vibrant green, suggesting an outdoor setting.",
