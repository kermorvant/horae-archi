    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ. Christ is shown on the cross, with a halo and a loincloth. His head is bowed, and blood drips from his wounds. To his left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, her arms crossed in sorrow. To his right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, looks upwards with a book in his hand, clad in an orange tunic and a green mantle. A blue bird is depicted in flight above Christ's left arm. At the foot of the cross lies a skull, symbolizing Golgotha. The background is a rich crimson with gold decorative motifs and lettering.",
