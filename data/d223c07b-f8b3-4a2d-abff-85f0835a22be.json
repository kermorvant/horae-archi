    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, wearing a red robe and a crown of thorns, is seated and appears to be suffering. Four figures surround him, two of whom are actively tormenting him. One man in a green tunic and purple leggings, wearing a yellow conical hat, kneels and appears to be striking Christ with a stick. Another man in a blue tunic and purple hat, with torn clothing, holds a stick and seems to be pushing Christ. A third figure in a green tunic is shown from the back, raising a club or mace above Christ's head. A fourth figure in a purple robe leans over, also holding a stick. The setting appears to be partially architectural, with large columns and an arch visible, suggesting an interior or a covered space. The background shows a blue sky with bare branches of trees and some stone structures.",
