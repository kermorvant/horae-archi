    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman in a hooded garment, seated and tending to a small animal, possibly a lamb or a dog, which is lying on her lap. She appears to be holding a tool or a knife. To her right, a stylized column separates her from a monstrous creature resembling a scorpion or a large insect, which is positioned over wavy lines suggesting water. In the background, to the left, foliage and a bearded man with a hood and a staff are visible. To the right, a cityscape with towers and buildings is depicted. The overall composition suggests a symbolic or allegorical representation rather than a specific biblical narrative.",
