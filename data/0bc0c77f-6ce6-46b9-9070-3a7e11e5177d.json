    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a long white beard, seated and wrapped in a white cloth, with his hands clasped over his chest. He appears frail and possibly ill. To his left, a man in a blue tunic with gold trim and a red, jeweled hat points towards the seated figure. Behind the pointing man, several other bearded men are visible, their faces partially obscured. In the background, a stylized architectural structure with towers and windows is depicted against a backdrop of green foliage and a blue sky. The overall impression is one of a narrative scene, possibly involving a consultation or a judgment, set in a somewhat idealized outdoor environment with architectural elements.",
