    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, possibly a saint or biblical figure, is depicted wearing a headdress and a draped garment. She is adorned with a necklace featuring a circular pendant and three smaller circular elements. Her left hand holds a vertical object, possibly a staff or a cross, while her right hand is raised with a pointing finger. Behind her, an architectural element resembling an arch is visible, decorated with foliage. To the right, a scroll unfurls with text in Gothic script, and further architectural elements, including a column with decorative carving, are present. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The text on the scroll, \"liba alparia,\" is likely a Latin inscription, possibly identifying the figure or providing a devotional context. Without further information or clearer iconography, a specific religious interpretation is difficult. However, the gesture of pointing and the presence of a staff-like object could suggest a figure of authority or a saintly attribute.",
