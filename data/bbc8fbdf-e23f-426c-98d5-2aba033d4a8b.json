    "scene_description_enriched": "A king kneels in prayer before a priest who stands at an altar. The king, wearing a crown and a grey robe with ermine trim, holds an open book. The priest, dressed in a richly decorated blue chasuble, gestures with his hands as if in blessing or prayer. Behind the priest is an altar with two open books and a chalice. To the left, a group of clerics, one reading from a lectern, observe the scene. The background is a red textile with a repeating geometric pattern, and the scene is framed by an ornate, quatrefoil-shaped border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a royal figure receiving a blessing or participating in a religious ceremony, possibly a Mass or a private devotion. The presence of the priest, altar, books, and chalice strongly suggests a liturgical context. The king's kneeling posture and open book indicate piety and engagement with the religious ritual.",
