    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an interior space with two figures. On the left, a man wearing a cap walks, carrying a bundle of wood or similar material over his shoulder and in his arms. He is dressed in a tunic and trousers. On the right, another man, also wearing a cap and a draped robe, is seated on a bench. He is holding an object in his hands, possibly a book or a scroll, and appears to be reading or contemplating. Behind him, a fireplace is visible with flames, suggesting a domestic setting. The architecture includes wooden beams and walls, with decorative elements above the figures.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a domestic interior, possibly illustrating a moment of daily life or a specific devotional practice within a home. The presence of a fireplace and the act of reading suggest a scene of comfort and contemplation. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or liturgical event cannot be definitively identified, but it could relate to a saint's life or a general theme of piety and study.",
