    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures seated. The figure on the left is a bearded man wearing a turban-like hat and a richly decorated robe. He holds a flower in his left hand and appears to be gesturing with his right hand, which is near a small vessel. The figure on the right is partially visible, with hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior setting, with decorative motifs including a stylized plant and what appear to be candelabra or decorative pillars. The overall style is that of a woodcut illustration, likely from a devotional text.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is likely a representation of a king or wise man, possibly from the Old Testament, engaged in prayer or contemplation, perhaps related to a prophecy or a divine revelation. The presence of the flower and the vessel could symbolize purity, offering, or a medicinal/alchemical practice, depending on the specific context of the Book of Hours.",
