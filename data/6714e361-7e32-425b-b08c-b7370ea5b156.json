    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies swaddled on a blue cloth. To her right, Saint Joseph, with a long white beard and wearing a blue robe and reddish-brown mantle, also kneels in prayer. Behind them, a donkey and an ox are visible. Above the stable, two angels with golden wings are shown, one holding a scroll with musical notation, while divine rays descend from above. In the background, rolling green hills are dotted with trees and a distant city with towers and buildings. The scene is framed by decorative borders with foliate motifs.",
