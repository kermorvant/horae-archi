    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, depicted with a pale, mask-like face and dark hair, stands centrally. She wears a long, flowing red robe adorned with gold patterns. In her hands, she holds a balance scale, with one pan resting on the floor and the other held up. The background suggests an interior architectural space with dark, panelled walls and what appear to be doorways or alcoves. The inscription above her head is partially visible and reads '...He...'. This figure is likely an allegorical representation of Justice, a common theme in medieval art, symbolizing the weighing of deeds and the administration of fairness.",
