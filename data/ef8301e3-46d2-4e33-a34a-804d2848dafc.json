    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, cradles the Christ Child on an orange surface, suggesting a bed or manger. Three Magi are present: one kneels, offering a golden vessel; another stands, also holding a vessel; and a third, dressed in yellow, looks upwards. The background is a patterned tapestry in shades of blue, red, and gold, with a blue drapery above and a star visible. The figures are richly attired, indicating their royal status. The overall setting is intimate and devotional, focusing on the presentation of gifts to the infant Jesus.",
