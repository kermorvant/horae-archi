    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King David, identified by the inscription 'DAVID', standing in a landscape with a harp nearby, looking upwards in prayer. He is accompanied by a group of figures, one of whom is identified as 'NABUGODONOSOR' (Nebuchadnezzar II), who is pointing towards a fortified building with blue domes and a clock face. The inscription 'PATRIO DRUM' floats above the figures. The overall scene appears to be a narrative illustration, possibly depicting a moment from the life of David or a related biblical event, with architectural elements suggesting a city or palace.",
