    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned figure, likely a king, kneels with hands clasped in prayer amidst jagged, green terrain. Above, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted seated on a red, petal-like cloud against a starry blue sky. The divine figure gestures with one hand and holds a book in the other, suggesting a moment of divine revelation or intercession. The scene is set outdoors, with no discernible architecture, under a celestial expanse.",
