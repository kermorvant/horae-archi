    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a female saint or allegorical figure, is depicted holding a sword. She wears a jeweled headdress and ornate clothing. To her left, a column with a capital is visible, suggesting an architectural setting. A banner with Latin inscription \"fidelis. et. pura\" (faithful and pure) is draped behind her. The scene is framed by decorative elements, including a border with text at the top, indicating it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's attributes, particularly the sword and the inscription \"fidelis. et. pura,\" suggest she represents a virtue or a saint known for faith and purity, possibly Saint Barbara or an allegorical representation of Faith. The overall context of a Book of Hours implies a devotional purpose.",
