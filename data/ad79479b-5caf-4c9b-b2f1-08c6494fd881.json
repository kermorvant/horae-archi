    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, kneeling with hands clasped in prayer, is positioned to the left of a manger containing the Christ Child. To the right, Saint Joseph, holding a candle, looks down at the infant. A cow and a donkey are present in the background. The setting appears to be a stable or a ruined structure, with architectural elements like a column and a dark, textured wall visible. The sky above is dark with clouds, and a moon is visible. The overall atmosphere is one of humble reverence.",
