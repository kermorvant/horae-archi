    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female figure, likely a saint or queen, kneels in a grassy landscape with rolling hills and trees in the background. She wears a rich, dark blue robe over a reddish-brown garment and holds a book in her left hand. Her right hand rests on a sword, which is positioned diagonally across the foreground, with its hilt near her hand and the blade extending towards the lower left. A halo encircles her head, and her long, blonde hair flows down her shoulders. In the sky above, two dark, bird-like shapes are depicted, possibly representing souls or abstract elements. The scene is rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with a focus on symbolic representation rather than naturalistic detail.",
