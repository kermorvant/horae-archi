    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. A newborn Christ Child lies on the ground, illuminated by golden rays emanating from above. To the left, an elderly man, likely Saint Joseph, kneels and holds a staff, looking towards the child. Behind him, the heads of a donkey and an ox are visible. In the center, the Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue mantle and with a halo, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, gazing at her son. To her right, another woman, possibly Saint Anne or a shepherdess, also kneels with her hands in prayer. The stable is constructed with wooden beams and a thatched roof, with a backdrop of trees and a blue sky.",
