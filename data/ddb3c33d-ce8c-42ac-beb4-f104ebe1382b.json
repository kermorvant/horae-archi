    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation ceremony within an arched architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a halo, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching out. Behind her stands another woman, also with a halo. In the center, a bearded man, identified by his bishop's mitre and ornate vestments, sits holding a red cloth. He is flanked by two other men, one with a beard and the other wearing a red cap. The figures are gathered around a green-covered table supported by ornate columns. The background features tall windows with tracery, suggesting an interior space. The overall scene likely represents a religious presentation or blessing, possibly the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, given the presence of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child with a figure in ecclesiastical attire.",
