    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, kneels beside a manger containing the infant Jesus. A donkey and a cow stand behind the manger, their heads close to the baby. To the right, an elderly man, presumably Saint Joseph, with a white beard and wearing a red cloak over a purple garment, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. The background features architectural elements suggesting a stable or ruined building, with columns, arches, and brick walls.",
