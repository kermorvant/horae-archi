    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral procession or burial rite taking place outdoors. Two figures in blue tunics are tending to a white-shrouded body lying on the ground, one adjusting its head. A group of clerics, some in black habits and others in white albs, are gathered around. One cleric, adorned in a blue and gold chasuble, holds an open book, while another carries a processional cross. Behind them, architectural elements suggest a town or religious complex, with buildings featuring arched windows and tiled roofs. The sky is a vibrant blue with golden stars, and decorative borders frame the scene.",
