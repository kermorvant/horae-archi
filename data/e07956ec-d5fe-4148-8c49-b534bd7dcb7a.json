    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a ram standing in a natural setting, surrounded by foliage. The ram is shown in profile, facing right, with its head turned slightly forward. Its body is rendered with numerous parallel lines, suggesting wool. The background is filled with a dense pattern of dots, possibly representing a starry sky or a decorative motif. Above the ram, an arched frame encloses the scene, with decorative elements at the corners. Below the ram, there are stylized flowers. The overall impression is of a pastoral or symbolic representation.",
