    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely King David, kneeling in prayer with his hands raised towards a radiant sun in a deep blue sky. He is dressed in a richly patterned crimson robe over a blue tunic and wears a distinctive blue and gold patterned hat. A harp rests beside him, suggesting his role as a musician and psalmist. The background features a stylized landscape with rolling hills, trees, and distant buildings with spires, indicative of a medieval town or city. Rays of light emanate from the sun, illuminating the scene and emphasizing a divine presence. In the distance, figures and animals are visible, suggesting a broader narrative context.",
