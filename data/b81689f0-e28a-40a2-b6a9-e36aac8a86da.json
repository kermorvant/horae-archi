    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, veiled and seated, cradles the Christ Child. Three kings, identified by their crowns and regal attire, approach. One king kneels before the child, offering a gift, while the other two stand, one holding a chalice and the other gesturing towards the heavens. Behind them, a building with a thatched roof and a small tower is visible, suggesting a rural or humble setting. The overall composition is framed by an ornate, decorative arch.",
