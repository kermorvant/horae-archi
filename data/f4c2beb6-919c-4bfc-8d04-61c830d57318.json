    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family in a pastoral setting. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, cradles the Christ Child in her arms. To her left, Saint Joseph, also with a halo and a long beard, looks on with a concerned expression. Behind them, a simplified representation of a town or castle with towers and walls is visible, suggesting a distant settlement. The figures are rendered in a woodcut style, with bold lines and hatching to indicate form and shadow. The overall impression is one of tender domesticity within a devotional context.",
