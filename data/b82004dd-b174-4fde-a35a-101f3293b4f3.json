    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified by a halo as a saint, stands pointing with his right hand. He wears a draped robe. To his right, a bull's head is visible, its horns curved upwards. In the upper left corner, a circular object with a grid pattern is depicted. Below the figures, a banner contains text in Gothic script. The scene appears to be a symbolic representation rather than a literal depiction of a specific event.",
