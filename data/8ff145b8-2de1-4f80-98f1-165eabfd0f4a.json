    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, with a halo, ascending into heaven. He is surrounded by a semicircular architectural element, possibly representing a celestial arch or a stylized cloud formation. Below Christ, a group of figures are shown looking upwards with hands clasped in prayer or awe. Two figures flank Christ on either side, also looking towards him. The setting appears to be a landscape with undulating ground. This imagery likely represents the Ascension of Christ, a pivotal event in Christian theology.",
