    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a crowned and haloed figure, identified as King David, seated on an ornate throne and playing a harp. He has a long white beard and wears a royal robe. Behind him, a group of men in colorful conical hats stand, some looking towards David. The background suggests an interior architectural setting with columns and patterned walls, draped with a blue fabric. The inscription \"CEVOSERVO\" is visible on a golden frieze above the throne. This scene is interpreted as David, the Psalmist King, playing music, likely in devotion or contemplation, as he is often depicted in medieval art as a musician and poet of the Psalms.",
