    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Betrayal of Christ, with Jesus at the center being embraced by Judas, who is identifiable by his kiss. Jesus, with a halo, is surrounded by a crowd of soldiers and other figures, some of whom are armed with spears and swords. In the foreground, several figures are shown fallen or in distress, suggesting a struggle. Behind the main action, a stylized representation of a city or fortress with numerous towers and banners is visible, set against a dark, star-filled sky. The overall composition is dense and dynamic, conveying the dramatic moment of Christ's arrest.",
