    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a decorative border featuring a stylized floral motif and a bearded male figure. The figure, wearing a cap and robes, is rendered in profile, with his body contorted to fit within the ornamental frame. He appears to be holding or interacting with the surrounding foliage. The overall impression is of an ornamental element rather than a narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is likely a decorative border from a Book of Hours, possibly incorporating allegorical or symbolic figures. Without further context or a more complete image, a specific religious or biblical interpretation is not possible. The figure could represent a prophet, a saint, or even a secular motif integrated into the devotional text.",
