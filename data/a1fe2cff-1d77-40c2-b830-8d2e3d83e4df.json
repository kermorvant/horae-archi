    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a golden halo and wearing a blue mantle, is seated on a wooden throne, holding the Christ Child. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is dressed in a light-colored garment and appears to be reaching out. Two angels, one on the left in a blue tunic and the other on the right in a green tunic, stand behind the throne with their hands clasped in prayer. Behind the figures, architectural elements suggest an interior space, with windows featuring diamond-shaped tracery visible on the left and right. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
