    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a solitary figure, likely Christ, standing within an arched architectural frame. The figure is clad in a white tunic and a vibrant pink robe, with a halo of rays emanating from his head, indicating divinity. He holds a long, green staff in his left hand and his right hand is partially obscured, but appears to be holding a small orb. The background is a striking blue, with abstract gold markings that could represent divine light or script. The ground beneath the figure is rendered in a sandy, textured beige. The overall impression is one of solemnity and spiritual contemplation, possibly representing Christ as the Man of Sorrows or a similar devotional image.",
