The Holy Spirit descends from above in the form of a dove, with rays of light emanating from it. The figures are arranged in a semi-circle, with Mary at the center, her hands clasped in prayer. One Apostle, seated on the right, reads from a book. The architecture consists of arched openings and a vaulted ceiling, suggesting a sacred or communal space. The overall atmosphere is one of divine inspiration and communal devotion.",
