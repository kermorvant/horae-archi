    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic battle in a verdant landscape. In the foreground, a centaur, pierced by arrows and a mace, is being attacked by two men. One man, blindfolded and wielding an axe, strikes the centaur's flank, while another man, also armed with an axe, attacks from the right. A female figure, possibly a nymph or a victim, is entwined with the centaur. Above them, a skeletal figure representing Death stands on a grassy knoll, holding a spear and a bundle of arrows, symbolizing the inevitability of mortality. In the background, a majestic castle with multiple towers and battlements overlooks a river and a forest where a lion is visible. The overall scene conveys a sense of struggle against death and the forces of nature, set against a backdrop of human civilization.",
