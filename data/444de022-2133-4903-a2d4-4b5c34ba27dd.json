    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ's body, pale and marked with wounds, is being lowered by several figures using ladders and a white shroud. One figure supports Christ's head, while others carefully maneuver the body. Below, a group of mourners, including the Virgin Mary in blue and a woman in gold, gaze upwards with expressions of grief. The setting is outdoors, with a green landscape dotted with trees and a distant castle on a hill. The scene is framed by architectural elements on the left, suggesting a view from within a building or a decorative border.",
