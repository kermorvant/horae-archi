    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated, holding the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child, wearing a crown, points outwards. Behind them, a rich blue curtain is drawn back, revealing a glimpse of architectural elements. To the right, two angels are present: one plays a lute, and the other plays a flute. The angel with the lute has red wings, while the other angel's wings are blue. The figures are positioned on a tiled floor within an interior space, suggested by the curtain and the background architecture.",
