    "scene_description_enriched": "A man in clerical vestments, with his hands clasped in prayer, kneels on a grassy hill. He is being stoned by two men. The man on the left, wearing a pink tunic and yellow hose, holds a round object, possibly a stone, raised to strike. The man on the right, dressed in a blue tunic and yellow hose, also holds a stone, poised to throw. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible under a blue sky with flying birds. This scene depicts the martyrdom of a saint, likely Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr, who was stoned to death.",
