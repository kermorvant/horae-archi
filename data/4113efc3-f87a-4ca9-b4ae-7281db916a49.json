    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a kneeling figure, possibly a beggar or supplicant, with visible sores on their face, presenting something in their hands to a central figure identified as Christ. Christ, with a halo and long hair, gestures with his right hand and extends his left, appearing to offer comfort or a blessing. Behind Christ, two bearded men observe the interaction. In the background, stylized buildings with towers and arched windows suggest an urban or town setting. The overall composition is framed by a large, decorative arch.",
