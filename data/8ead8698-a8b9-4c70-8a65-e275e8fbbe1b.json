Its body is covered in stylized wool, and it has prominent, curled horns. The background is filled with a dense pattern of dots and leaves, suggesting a lush environment. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements at the top corners. The ram, a symbol of sacrifice and Christ, is rendered in a woodcut style typical of medieval manuscripts.",
