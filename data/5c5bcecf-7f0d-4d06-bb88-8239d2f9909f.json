Elizabeth wears a white veil and a green tunic over a golden robe. Behind them, a stone building with a tower and red-tiled roofs is visible, suggesting an architectural setting. The ground is green and grassy, with some rocky formations in the background. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
