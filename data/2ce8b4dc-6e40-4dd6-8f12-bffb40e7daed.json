    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a coat of arms, featuring a helmet surmounted by a crown and a crest. Two wild men, covered in fur and wearing loincloths, stand on either side, supporting the heraldic shield. Red and gold ribbons, inscribed with Latin text, frame the composition. The background is a deep blue dotted with gold stars, and the lower portion shows a green landscape with stylized foliage. The inscription on the upper ribbon reads 'MAIS LA' and on the lower ribbon 'NON CV'. This imagery likely represents a family crest or a motto, possibly alluding to a lineage or a personal declaration.",
