    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed woman, likely a saint, is depicted kneeling outdoors, engrossed in reading a book. She wears a blue tunic with gold trim and voluminous gold sleeves, over which a pink mantle with gold lining is draped. Her hair is braided and falls over her shoulders. To her left, a cylindrical tower with crenellations and arched openings rises, suggesting a fortified structure. Behind her, a rocky, green landscape is visible. The scene is framed by an arched border with gold ornamentation. The presence of the halo and the book suggests a devotional context, possibly representing a saint in contemplation or study.",
