    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men in medieval attire, some wearing hats. Two central figures are engaged in conversation, with one gesturing. Behind them, other men are visible, some looking towards the central interaction. A dog is seated at the lower right. The figures are framed by an architectural element suggesting an archway or a niche. The overall impression is of a gathering or a discussion.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is too generic to be definitively interpreted as a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional event without further context or clearer iconographic clues. It could represent a secular gathering, a historical event, or a scene from a saint's life, but none are explicitly identifiable.",
