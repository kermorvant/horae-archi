    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo, interacting with a man afflicted with a skin disease, possibly leprosy, who is emerging from a tomb-like structure. Christ, dressed in a purple robe, gestures towards the afflicted man. To Christ's left, three other figures stand, one of whom is kneeling and praying, dressed in green and red robes. In the background, a city with towers and spires is visible, suggesting an urban setting. The architecture includes arched doorways and walls, with a sense of depth created by receding structures. The overall scene is interpreted as Christ healing the leper, a significant miracle in Christian narrative.",
