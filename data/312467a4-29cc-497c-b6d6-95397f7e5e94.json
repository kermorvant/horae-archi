    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, likely a scribe or scholar, is seated in a wooden chair, diligently working on a manuscript laid out on a slanted lectern. He holds a quill in his right hand, poised to write, and appears to be looking upwards, perhaps in contemplation or receiving inspiration. To his right, a winged figure, likely an angel, kneels on a checkered floor. The angel is dressed in a white robe and looks towards the man with a gentle expression, holding a small, dark object in its hands. Behind the man, a large window with intricate tracery reveals a landscape scene. The overall setting suggests an interior space, possibly a study or scriptorium, within a building with Gothic architectural features.",
