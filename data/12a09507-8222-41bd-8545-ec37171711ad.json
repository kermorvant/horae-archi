    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a highly detailed, dark brown scorpion-like creature against a vibrant blue background. The creature has a segmented body, multiple pairs of spindly legs ending in sharp claws, and a segmented tail that curves upwards, tipped with a bulbous stinger. The rendering is naturalistic, emphasizing the exoskeleton and the articulation of its limbs. There is no architectural setting or human figures present.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Scorpions in medieval bestiaries and manuscripts often symbolized evil, treachery, or the devil due to their venomous sting. They could also represent the astrological sign Scorpio. Without further context from a larger manuscript, its specific devotional or allegorical meaning remains ambiguous, but it likely carries a negative or cautionary connotation.",
