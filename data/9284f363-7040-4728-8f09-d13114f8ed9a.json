    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist in a rocky, outdoor landscape, seated and writing on a scroll. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a rose-colored cloak lined with green, and has a golden halo. To his left, a golden eagle, his traditional symbol, perches on a rock and appears to be looking at the scroll. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible on a hill under a starry blue sky. Rays of golden light descend from the sky. Further in the distance, another city with golden buildings is depicted, and a figure on horseback is shown in the middle ground.",
