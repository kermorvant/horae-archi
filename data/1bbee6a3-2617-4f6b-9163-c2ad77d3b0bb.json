    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral landscape with two figures. In the foreground, a seated man in a blue tunic and red cloak holds a spindle and wool, while a standing man in a dark blue tunic and conical hat, holding a staff, gestures upwards. Sheep graze in the background, and a basket filled with fish is visible. Above them, a bust of a figure, possibly Christ or God, is depicted within a golden halo, with a banner inscribed with Latin text: \"Ouer natus est nobis et filius\". In the distance, a fortified castle with towers and walls is situated on a hill. The overall scene suggests a devotional context related to the Nativity, with the inscription referencing the birth of Christ.",
