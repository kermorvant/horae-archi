    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female figure, possibly a queen or saint, is depicted holding a flaming torch in her right hand and pointing with her left index finger. She wears a jeweled headdress and a richly decorated garment with a cape. The figure is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative tracery, suggesting an interior or a symbolic architectural setting. The scene is rendered in a black and white woodcut style, typical of medieval manuscripts.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's regalia and the flaming torch suggest she might represent a saint, possibly Saint Barbara, who is often depicted with a tower and a palm branch, or Saint Lucy, associated with light and sight. The torch could symbolize divine illumination, faith, or martyrdom. Without further context, a definitive interpretation is difficult, but it likely relates to a devotional or hagiographic narrative.",
