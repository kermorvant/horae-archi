    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a scholar or saint, is depicted seated and reading from two open books. He wears a hooded robe. To his right, a bull is visible, its head turned towards the viewer. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior space, with a vaulted ceiling and a window with tracery visible in the background. The presence of the bull, one of the Evangelist symbols, suggests this scene may represent Saint Luke.",
