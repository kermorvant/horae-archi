    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, holds the Christ Child on her lap, both also with halos. They are seated within a wooden structure. Three Magi, identified by their crowns and rich attire, approach them. The first two Magi are standing, one holding a vessel and the other pointing. The third Magi is kneeling, offering a gift. In the lower left, a man in blue robes with a long beard, possibly Saint Joseph, is shown holding tools, near a cow and a donkey. The background shows architectural elements and a starry sky with a comet, suggesting a nighttime setting. The overall scene is a representation of the Nativity and the subsequent visit of the Magi.",
