    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint Luke by the presence of his symbolic ox, is depicted seated indoors, diligently writing in a large open book placed on a lectern. He wears a blue tunic and a red cloak, and a halo signifies his sainthood. The setting includes a wooden desk with books and an inkwell, a window with diamond-shaped panes, and draped curtains. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern. The scene likely represents Saint Luke as an evangelist, writing his Gospel.",
