    "scene_description_enriched": "A young man, likely a noble or saint, is depicted on horseback, wearing a red cloak over a brown tunic and a blue headband. He is looking down towards a smaller, older man who is gesturing upwards. Behind the rider, a fortified building with towers and crenellations is visible, suggesting a castle or city. The scene appears to be outdoors, with a hint of a blue sky and possibly rain or mist in the upper left corner. The interaction between the two figures, with the rider appearing to bestow a gesture or blessing upon the supplicant, suggests a scene of patronage, charity, or a saintly act.",
