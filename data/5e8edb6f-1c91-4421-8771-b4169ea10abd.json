    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession of figures, possibly soldiers or a retinue, are depicted in profile, moving from left to right. They are rendered in earthy tones of brown and ochre, with some gold leaf accents. The figures appear to be on horseback, though the horses are only partially visible and stylized. They are moving through a landscape that includes a body of water, depicted in shades of green and blue with horizontal lines suggesting reeds or ripples. Above the figures, a band of blue with vertical dark lines might represent a sky or a decorative border.",
