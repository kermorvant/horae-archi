    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a robed figure, likely a bishop or high-ranking cleric, seated behind a wooden desk, writing on a scroll. The figure wears a mitre and a blue and gold cope. Behind the desk, a richly patterned tapestry hangs. To the right, a smaller figure, possibly an acolyte or a saint, kneels, holding a scroll with text. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the presence of windows showing a landscape outside, and architectural elements like columns and an arched frame. The overall impression is one of scholarly or spiritual activity within a structured environment.",
