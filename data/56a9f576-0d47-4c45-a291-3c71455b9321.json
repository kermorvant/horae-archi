The figure wears a white alb and a dark, star-patterned cope, holding an open book in their left hand and a palm frond in their right. The background features a patterned textile and ornate architectural elements, including pointed arches, columns, and tracery windows, suggesting an interior space of religious significance. The floor is tiled in a geometric pattern. The overall impression is one of solemn devotion and sanctity.",
