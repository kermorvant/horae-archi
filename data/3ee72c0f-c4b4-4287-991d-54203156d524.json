    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a group of figures, likely clergy or monks, kneeling and praying. They are dressed in distinct robes, one in blue and another in green, both with hoods and banded collars. Their hands are clasped together in prayer, and their gazes are directed upwards. The style is characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination, with bold outlines and flat colors. No architectural elements or specific setting are visible, suggesting a focus on the devotional act itself.",
