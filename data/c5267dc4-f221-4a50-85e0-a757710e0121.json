    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is seated on a donkey, cradling the Christ Child. She is wrapped in a blue mantle. Leading the donkey is Saint Joseph, depicted as an older man with a beard, wearing a dark hat and a red robe over a yellow tunic. He holds a staff. In the background, a moon hangs in a twilight sky with clouds. A rural landscape unfolds with trees and a village with thatched-roof houses. To the right, a stone building with arched windows and a tiled roof is visible, suggesting a town or settlement.",
