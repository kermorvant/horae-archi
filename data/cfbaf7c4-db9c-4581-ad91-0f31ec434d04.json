    "scene_description_enriched": "A multitude of female figures, all with golden halos, are depicted in a dense arrangement. The foreground features a group of women, some veiled and others with elaborate hairstyles. One woman in the center wears a blue robe and holds a book or tablet. To her right, another woman in a blue robe and gold trim holds her hands in a gesture of prayer or supplication. To the left, a woman in a gold robe is shown with her hands clasped. On the far right, a woman in an orange and white gown stands with her hands resting on her hips. The background is filled with rows of more haloed women, their faces and halos creating a shimmering, layered effect. The scene is framed by ornate, golden architectural elements on the left and right, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The overall impression is one of a heavenly assembly or a gathering of saints.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a gathering of holy women, possibly virgins or martyrs, in heaven. The abundance of halos signifies their sanctity. The woman in the center holding a book could represent a specific saint known for her learning or piety, or perhaps the Virgin Mary. The overall composition suggests a celestial court or a vision of paradise.",
