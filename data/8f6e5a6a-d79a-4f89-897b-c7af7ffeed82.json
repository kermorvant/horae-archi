    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ, with a halo and wounds, is being lowered from a wooden cross by two figures. One figure, wearing a gold garment and a patterned cap, uses tongs to assist in the removal of nails. Another figure, in a pink patterned robe, supports Christ's body. To the right, the Virgin Mary, veiled in blue and with a halo, clasps her hands in grief, while a youthful figure, also with a halo, looks on with sorrow. The background is a vibrant blue, and the ground is rendered in green with stylized grass. The entire scene is framed by a decorative border.",
