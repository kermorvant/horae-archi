In the foreground, a friar in a brown habit kneels with his arms outstretched, showing stigmata on his hands. To his right, another figure in a white robe with red trim also kneels in prayer. In the background, a radiant angelic figure descends from the sky, emitting golden light. To the left, a figure in a dark habit kneels in prayer. In the far distance, a town with a prominent church spire is visible, along with other buildings and a river.",
