    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral procession outside a Gothic church. Several figures are present: two individuals in light blue robes are lowering a wooden coffin into a grave, while another person in a red tunic and blue sleeves holds a black hat. Behind them, a group of clergy, including a figure in a blue cope reading from a red book, and several individuals in black monastic habits, observe the proceedings. In the background, the ornate facade of a church with pointed arches and spires is visible, alongside a cityscape of brick buildings with varied rooflines and towers. The overall atmosphere suggests a solemn religious ceremony taking place in a communal setting.",
