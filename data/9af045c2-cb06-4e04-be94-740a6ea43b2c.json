The larger shield, positioned behind and above the animal, is gold with a red cross and is adorned with blue birds and grey scallop shells. The smaller shield, held in the animal's right paw, is red and features three gold fleur-de-lis. The background is a rich red fabric with an intricate gold pattern of swirling vines and flowers. The overall scene is decorative and heraldic, lacking a specific narrative or religious event.",
