    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, wearing a halo and an elaborate headdress, is seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child. Saint Joseph, with a beard and wearing a tunic and cloak, walks beside the donkey, leading it by a rope. The background suggests an outdoor setting with stylized trees and a building with a domed roof in the distance. The sky is dark and dotted with stars, indicating nighttime or a celestial setting. The overall style is characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
