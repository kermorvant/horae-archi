    "scene_description_enriched": "This image displays a decorative border with intricate foliate and zoomorphic motifs, rendered in black ink on a parchment background. The border features stylized leaves, swirling tendrils, and what appears to be a grotesque or mythical creature with a prominent head and stylized body. The overall impression is one of ornamental richness, typical of medieval manuscript illumination. There are no figures or architectural elements depicted within the border itself, suggesting it serves as a frame for text or a larger illustration.",
