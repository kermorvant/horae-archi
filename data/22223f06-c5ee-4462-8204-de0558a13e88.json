    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a dark robe and mantle, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies on the ground. To the right, Saint Joseph, bearded and wearing a dark cloak over a white tunic, also kneels, gesturing towards the child. Behind them is a simple architectural structure with a brick wall and a thatched roof, suggesting a stable. The background shows a pastoral landscape with trees and a fence.",
