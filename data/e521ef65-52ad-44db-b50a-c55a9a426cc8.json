    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a group of four men, three of whom are wearing elaborate crowns or miters, suggesting they are figures of high religious or secular authority. The leftmost figure wears a papal tiara, indicating the Pope. Next to him, a figure in a bishop's miter and ornate vestments appears to be speaking or gesturing. To the right, a bearded man with a crown and a third figure, also crowned and with hands clasped in prayer, complete the group. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior setting, possibly a hall or a church interior, with decorative arches visible.",
