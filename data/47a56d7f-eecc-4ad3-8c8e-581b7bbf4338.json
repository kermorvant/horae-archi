    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded male figure, identified as Saint John the Baptist by his halo and staff, is depicted in the foreground, wearing a blue robe over a red tunic. He appears to be walking on clouds or a rocky terrain. Behind him, a younger figure, likely an angel, is shown in a purple garment, holding a golden orb and gesturing with their other hand. The background features a rich red tapestry with gold ornamentation. The scene is rendered with a limited palette and a somewhat stylized approach, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
