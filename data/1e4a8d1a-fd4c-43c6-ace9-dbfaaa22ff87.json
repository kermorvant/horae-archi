The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching out towards a figure in a red mitre and pink robe, likely a priest or bishop, who is gesturing towards a stone altar. To the left, another woman in a pink dress carries a basket containing two doves. The background features a decorative, tiled pattern and a green canopy above. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their saintly status. The altar is draped with a red cloth adorned with gold motifs and fringed with white.
