    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated and cradles the Christ Child. Three Magi approach, one kneeling and offering a gift, while the other two stand. The figures are set against a backdrop of rolling green hills and a simple wooden structure with a thatched roof. The architectural elements are minimal, suggesting a humble setting for the Nativity.",
