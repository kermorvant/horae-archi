    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and the book she holds, stands in a verdant landscape. She wears a blue tunic and a crimson cloak, and holds a tall staff. Above her, an angel with golden wings descends, holding a similar staff. To the right, a winged demon with red skin and sharp claws lunges towards the saint, its mouth open as if in a snarl. In the background, a winding path leads through rolling hills dotted with trees, and a distant castle is visible on a hilltop. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
