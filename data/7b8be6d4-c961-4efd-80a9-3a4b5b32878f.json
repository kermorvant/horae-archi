    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal figure, likely a king, seated on a throne and holding a scepter and orb, wearing a crown. Before him kneels a woman, possibly the Virgin Mary, with her hands clasped in prayer. Two angels are present: one on the left presents a crown to the kneeling figure, while another on the right plays a lute. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the presence of drapery and architectural elements like columns and an arch framing the scene. The background features a green, textured surface with radiating lines, possibly representing divine light or a tapestry.",
