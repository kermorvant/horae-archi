    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure clad in ornate golden armor, adorned with red detailing and fleur-de-lis motifs, stands in a grassy landscape under a blue sky with stylized clouds. The figure holds a dark, short sword in their right hand and appears to be in distress, with their head tilted back and mouth open. To the left, a lion with a golden mane and body is depicted, its head turned towards the figure. The lion's posture suggests it is either being subdued or is a companion to the armored figure. The overall scene is rendered in a vibrant, stylized manner typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a scene from classical mythology or a allegorical representation rather than a biblical narrative, given the presence of the lion and the armored figure. It could represent a personification of a virtue or vice, or a figure from ancient history or legend. Without further context or accompanying text, a definitive religious interpretation is not possible. However, the stylized depiction and the presence of a lion could allude to themes of strength, courage, or even the taming of wild beasts, which can have allegorical meanings in a devotional context.",
