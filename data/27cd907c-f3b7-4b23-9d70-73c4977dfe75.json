    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural setting. On the right, a woman with a halo, presumably the Virgin Mary, is shown with her hands clasped. To her left stands a young boy, also with clasped hands, suggesting prayer or reverence. Behind them, a bearded man wearing a hat and a tunic, likely Joseph, is visible. The figures are positioned in front of a backdrop that includes architectural elements such as arches and what appears to be a stylized building with a gable and windows. Rays of light emanate from above, possibly indicating divine presence or blessing. The overall composition suggests a religious narrative, likely the Holy Family or a related devotional scene.",
