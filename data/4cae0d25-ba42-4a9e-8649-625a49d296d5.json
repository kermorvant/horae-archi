    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, a bearded man with a halo, likely representing God the Father or Christ, is seated and gesturing with his right hand. Facing him, on the right, is a woman with a halo, presumably the Virgin Mary, kneeling and clasping her hands. Behind her, an angel with wings, identified as the Angel Gabriel, kneels in a window opening, looking towards Mary. The setting appears to be an interior space with architectural elements suggesting a domestic or possibly a chapel setting, indicated by a patterned screen on the left and an arched doorway with gothic tracery. The background outside the window shows a blue sky with clouds.",
