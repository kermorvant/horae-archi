    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and a halo, is seated on a blue donkey, cradling the Christ Child, who is swaddled in white. Joseph, with a blue cap and a beard, walks beside the donkey, carrying a red cloth bundle on a stick over his shoulder. The figures are set against a gold background, suggesting a divine or spiritual context, with a patch of green grass at the bottom indicating the ground. The overall composition is simple and devotional.",
