    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded male figures, likely representing Old Testament prophets or patriarchs, are seated. The figure on the left, wearing a golden-trimmed pink robe over a white garment, gestures with his right hand towards an open book placed on a green surface between them. The figure on the right, also in a pink robe and white garment, wears a tall, tiered white headdress and holds a globe in his lap. Above them, a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends with outstretched wings. The background is a vibrant blue, with stylized red architectural elements or banners on either side, framing the figures. The overall scene evokes a sense of divine revelation or theological discourse.",
