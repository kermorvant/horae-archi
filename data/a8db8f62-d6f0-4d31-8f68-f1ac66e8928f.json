    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a frail, elderly man with a long white beard, partially undressed and lying on a textured surface, possibly straw or hay. He is looking upwards with a pained or contemplative expression. Around him stand several figures, some appearing concerned or judgmental. One man, wearing a golden robe and a green hat, gestures with his finger, seemingly addressing the reclining figure. Another man in a blue tunic with crossed arms looks down with a somber expression. The background suggests an outdoor setting with wooden structures and foliage, framed by an arched border adorned with floral motifs.",
