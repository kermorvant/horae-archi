    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of five men are depicted, each playing a stringed instrument. They are dressed in medieval attire, with tunics and hose. The figures are arranged in a procession, with their heads tilted downwards as if in concentration or sorrow. The background is a textured pattern, suggesting a stylized ground or perhaps a woven tapestry. The scene is framed by a decorative border, with a red stripe on the left. The overall impression is one of a musical performance or a solemn procession.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a musical procession or a group of musicians, possibly related to a religious or civic event. Without further context, a specific biblical or devotional interpretation is not possible. However, music played a significant role in medieval life, both in religious services and secular celebrations.",
