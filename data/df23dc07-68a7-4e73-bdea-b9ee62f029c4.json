    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, stands within an architectural setting, holding a blue book adorned with gold stars. The figure wears a golden robe over a white garment and holds a grid-like object with a long handle. To the left, an open doorway reveals a landscape with blue structures and a body of water. The background inside the structure features tall, dark panels with vertical lines, suggesting a cupboard or a wall with decorative elements. The overall scene is framed by ornate golden architectural elements, possibly representing a canopy or decorative archway.",
