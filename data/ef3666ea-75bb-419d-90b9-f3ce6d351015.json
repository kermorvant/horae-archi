    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a Gothic architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with blue wings and a halo, is seated and holds a scroll with Latin text. He gestures towards the Virgin Mary on the right, who is standing, also with a halo, and looking towards the angel. She holds an open book and her hands are raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. The architecture features pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and windows with tracery, suggesting a church or chapel interior. Above the architectural structure, a celestial scene with stars and a figure (possibly God the Father) is visible. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern, and a green curtain hangs in the background.",
