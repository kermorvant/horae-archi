    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border featuring stylized foliage and two grotesque figures. On the left, a creature resembling a monkey or a bear with large eyes and a gaping mouth is depicted. On the right, a similar creature is shown, also with prominent features and a somewhat menacing expression. Between these figures, elaborate scrolling leaves and floral motifs are rendered in a black-and-white woodcut style. The overall impression is one of ornamental design rather than a narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image appears to be a decorative border or initial from a medieval manuscript, likely intended to frame text or an illustration. The grotesque figures and foliate motifs are common decorative elements in medieval art, often used for their symbolic or purely aesthetic value, rather than to depict a specific religious or biblical event.",
