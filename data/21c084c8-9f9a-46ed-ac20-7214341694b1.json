The standing figure, also wearing a halo, is robed in brown and white, holding a book in one hand and a staff topped with a rose in the other. The background is a decorative pattern of blue and pink diamonds with gold floral motifs, framed by a blue and red border. The scene appears to be a devotional representation, possibly depicting a saint interceding for a supplicant.",
