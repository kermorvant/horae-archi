    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bedside vigil or prayer. On the left, a figure lies in a bed, covered by a white sheet, with a person in a dark robe leaning over them, hands outstretched in supplication. To the right, a bishop, identifiable by his mitre and ornate vestments, stands within an architectural niche, holding a bag and a staff. Beside him, two figures are shown in prayer, one with hands clasped and the other with hands extended. The background features decorative architectural elements and a large illuminated initial letter. The overall scene suggests a moment of spiritual intercession or a deathbed scene, possibly invoking the intercession of Saint Nicholas, as suggested by the accompanying text.",
