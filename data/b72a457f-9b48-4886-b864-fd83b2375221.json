An angel with golden wings and a halo, dressed in red, hovers over her, gesturing protectively. To the right, a dark, demonic figure with horns and outstretched arms appears to menace the woman. Above, in a celestial vision, the Virgin Mary holds the Christ Child, both with halos. The background is a red tapestry with a geometric pattern, and the foreground is a green ground.",
