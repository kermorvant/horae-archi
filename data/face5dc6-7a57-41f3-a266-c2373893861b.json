    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures, identified as saints by their halos, stand beneath an arched architectural element. The figure on the left holds a book in his left hand and a sword upright in his right. The figure on the right holds a book in his left hand and a cross in his right. Both figures are bearded and wear simple robes. The background is filled with a dotted pattern, suggesting a stylized or abstract setting. The scene is framed by an ornamental border. This imagery likely represents Saints Peter and Paul, prominent apostles often depicted with their respective symbols: Peter with the keys (represented here by the cross) and Paul with the sword, symbolizing his martyrdom.",
