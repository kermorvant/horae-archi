The figure on the right, a bearded man, holds a globe in his left hand and raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing or speech. He wears a cloak over a tunic. The figure on the left, a woman, looks down and raises her hands in a gesture of supplication or humility. Both figures have halos, indicating their saintly or royal status. The architectural setting is elaborate, featuring pointed arches, pinnacles, and decorative tracery, suggesting a Gothic style. The overall composition is framed by vertical elements resembling miniature spires and ornamental scrolls.",
