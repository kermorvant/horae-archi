    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling in prayer, dressed in a blue robe and a pink cloak, with a white fur collar. He is positioned within an architectural setting that includes a richly decorated column and archway on the left. In the background, an angel with wings and a sword hovers in the sky, pointing towards a celestial figure, possibly God, who is depicted in a halo of light. Below the angel, a city with towers and walls is visible, situated near a body of water and a bridge. On the floor in front of the kneeling man, a crown rests on a cushion, and a harp lies nearby. The overall scene suggests a divine intervention or revelation.",
