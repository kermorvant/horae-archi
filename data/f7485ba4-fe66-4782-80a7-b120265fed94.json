    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a decorative border with a stylized floral motif and a grotesque creature. The creature, depicted in profile, has a reptilian or canine head with sharp teeth and a scaly body. It appears to be emerging from swirling, wave-like forms. Above and to the right of the creature, there are hints of architectural elements, possibly a column or pillar, and abstract shapes that could represent foliage or drapery. The overall impression is one of a decorative initial or a marginal illustration, likely from a medieval manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image does not depict a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional scene. It appears to be a decorative element, possibly a grotesque or a zoomorphic initial, common in medieval manuscripts for aesthetic and symbolic purposes, often representing the wildness of nature or the presence of evil.",
