    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, dressed in a dark habit and holding a staff, stands on the right, gesturing towards three men. The men are depicted in various states of supplication and infirmity. One man, in a blue robe, kneels with his hands clasped in prayer. Another man, in an orange tunic and blue hood, leans on two crutches, his leg appearing injured. A third man, in a red hood and grey robe, stands behind the kneeling man, also appearing elderly and possibly infirm. The background features a richly patterned red tapestry, and the ground is a green field with sparse vegetation. The scene likely depicts a saint performing a miracle of healing or offering spiritual solace.",
