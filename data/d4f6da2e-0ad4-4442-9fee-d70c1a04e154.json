    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man, identified as Saint Mark, is depicted writing on a scroll. He is seated and dressed in a blue tunic and a pink cloak. To his left, a winged lion, the symbol of Saint Mark, rests its head on its paws, looking towards the viewer. The scene is set against a dark background, with a checkered floor visible beneath the figures. A green lectern with ornate golden supports holds the scroll. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine inspiration for the evangelist.",
