    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands holding an open book. He wears a red and gold cope over a white alb and a blue dalmatic. His right hand, bearing stigmata, is visible. Behind him, a niche contains a sculpted figure, and a green curtain hangs to the left. The scene is framed by an ornate border with blue and gold foliate motifs. The bishop's attire and the presence of stigmata suggest a devotional image, possibly representing a saintly bishop or a figure associated with the Passion of Christ.",
