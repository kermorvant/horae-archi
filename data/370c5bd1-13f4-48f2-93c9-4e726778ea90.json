    "scene_description_enriched": "In an outdoor landscape, a naked man lies prone on the ground, seemingly deceased or in a state of profound weakness. To his left, an angel with large red and yellow wings, clad in a light purple robe, extends a staff towards a small, glowing figure of a child. To the right, a winged, demonic creature with brown, leathery wings and sharp claws reaches towards the man's head, appearing to threaten him. In the background, rolling green hills are visible, with a distant walled town or castle. The scene likely depicts the struggle for a soul, with the angel representing divine intervention and the demon representing temptation or damnation.",
