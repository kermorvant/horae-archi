    "scene_description_enriched": "In a mountainous landscape, two shepherds, one in a pink tunic and green headscarf, the other in a blue tunic and straw hat, tend to a flock of sheep. The shepherd on the left holds a long staff, while the one on the right leans on a similar staff. Above them, an angel in an orange garment descends from the sky, holding a scroll that reads \"Gloria in excelsis Deo.\" The scene depicts the Annunciation to the Shepherds, a pivotal moment in the Nativity narrative where angels announce the birth of Christ to humble shepherds.",
