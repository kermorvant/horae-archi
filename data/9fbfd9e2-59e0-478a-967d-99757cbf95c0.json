    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely Saint Jerome, is depicted seated and reading from an open book. He wears a hat and a pink robe with a blue collar. To his right, a lion with a golden mane is shown. The background suggests an indoor setting with architectural elements, including a draped curtain and a carved panel with a circular motif. The scene is likely an illustration of Saint Jerome, known for his translation of the Bible and his association with a lion.",
