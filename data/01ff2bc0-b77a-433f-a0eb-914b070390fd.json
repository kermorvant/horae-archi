    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be a dramatic or violent event. In the foreground, a person kneels, possibly in supplication or distress, with hands outstretched. Behind this figure, a man in a helmet raises a sword, poised to strike. To the right, a bearded man, possibly a figure of authority, gestures with his finger, seemingly directing the action. The background suggests an architectural setting with decorative elements resembling crenellations and arches, hinting at a fortified or ceremonial space. The overall impression is one of conflict or judgment.",
