    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a young person, possibly a boy, wearing a blue cap and a white tunic with blue sleeves, engaged in sowing seeds. The figure is shown in profile, looking downwards, with one hand holding a pouch of seeds and the other scattering them onto the ground. To the left, a large, white basket or container holds a mound of what appears to be grain or seeds. In the background, a stylized landscape features green hills dotted with gold leaf, and a cluster of red flowers. Behind the landscape, a fortified building complex with towers and crenellations is visible, suggesting a town or castle. The overall scene evokes a sense of agricultural labor and the bounty of the earth, likely representing a month or a season associated with sowing.",
