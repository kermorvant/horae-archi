    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier (partially visible), stands in profile, gesturing with his right hand. He is robed in a rich, gold-trimmed crimson garment. Before him kneels a figure in a blue tunic and white head covering, with hands clasped in prayer. The background depicts a stylized landscape with rolling green hills and a bright blue sky. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a bishop bestowing a blessing or performing a rite upon a supplicant. Given the context of a Book of Hours, this could represent a saintly figure interacting with a devotee, or a moment of spiritual guidance.",
