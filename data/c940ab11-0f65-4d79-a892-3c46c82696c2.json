    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identifiable by her halo, stands holding an open book in her left hand and a broom in her right. She wears a dark habit with a gold hood and a blue mantle adorned with fleur-de-lis. The background depicts a landscape with rolling hills and a distant, undefined building. The saint's gaze is directed forward, and her expression is somber. The broom is a symbol often associated with Saint Martha, who is depicted as having tamed a dragon.",
