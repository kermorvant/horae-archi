    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, with a halo, is bound and appears to be enduring torment. Several figures surround him: one in a green tunic and blue breeches, another in a red tunic and helmet, and a third man in a yellow hat, holding a whip aloft. A dog is present in the foreground. In the background, there is a large, imposing brick structure with arched openings and a domed building with towers, suggesting a city setting. The ground is paved and scattered with branches and a discarded broom.",
