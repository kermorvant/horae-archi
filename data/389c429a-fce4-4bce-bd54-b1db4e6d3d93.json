    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with feathered wings and a halo, kneels and presents a scroll inscribed with \"Ave Maria Gratia Plena\". Facing him on the right is the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, dressed in a dark robe and holding an open book. She has her hands clasped over her chest in a gesture of humility or acceptance. Above them, in an arched niche, a bearded figure, likely God the Father, is depicted with rays of light emanating from him, and a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends towards Mary. The background features a patterned textile and a window with tracery. The floor is tiled in a geometric pattern. The entire scene is framed by an ornate arch with floral motifs.",
