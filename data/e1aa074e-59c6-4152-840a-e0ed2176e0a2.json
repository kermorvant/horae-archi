    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Raising of Lazarus. Christ, with outstretched arms and a halo, is shown on the right, gesturing towards a figure lying on a bed, presumably Lazarus. Lazarus is wrapped in a shroud and appears to be rising. To the left of the bed, a woman, likely Mary or Martha, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, while another figure stands behind her. Above, angels are depicted, one of whom is carrying a soul towards heaven. The architectural setting is suggested by a blue brick wall and arched structures in the background, framed by decorative borders. The overall scene is set within an arched architectural frame, with a golden background indicating a divine or spiritual realm.",
