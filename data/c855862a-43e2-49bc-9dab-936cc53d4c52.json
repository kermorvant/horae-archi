The figure wears a hooded garment and is shown in profile, holding a sickle in their right hand and reaching towards a stalk of wheat with their left. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or precious context, and the wheat stalks are rendered with vertical lines. The scene appears to be an initial letter, possibly representing the month of August or a harvest-related theme.",
