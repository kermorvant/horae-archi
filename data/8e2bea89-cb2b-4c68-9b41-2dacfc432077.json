    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a procession outdoors. A central figure, presumably Christ, is led by a man in a red hat and blue tunic, who holds a rope attached to Christ's hands. Christ is dressed in a long, muted purple robe and appears to be bound. Behind Christ, soldiers in armor and helmets are visible, carrying spears. The setting is a hilly landscape with sparse vegetation and a blue sky dotted with gold specks. The ground is rendered in shades of pink and green, with a path winding through it. The overall impression is one of arrest or procession to judgment.",
