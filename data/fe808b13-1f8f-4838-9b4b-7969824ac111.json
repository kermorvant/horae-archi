    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a saint, identifiable by her halo, lying on a tilted wooden bench. A figure dressed in blue and a red cap is using forceps to extract a tooth from the saint's mouth. Another figure, dressed in orange and blue, sits on the ground holding a tool, possibly assisting or waiting. The background is a decorative tapestry with a diamond pattern of fleur-de-lis. The ground is depicted as green with sparse vegetation. This scene likely represents the martyrdom of Saint Apollonia, who is traditionally depicted as having her teeth extracted.",
