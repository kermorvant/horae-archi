    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an architectural frame. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a halo, stands beside the Christ Child, who is seated on a stool and holds an object in his hand. The Christ Child also has a halo. Facing them on the right is a bearded man, likely a scholar or elder, with his hands extended in a gesture of teaching or discussion. Behind him are three other figures, also wearing conical hats, who appear to be listening. Above the figures, a green oil lamp with a flame hangs from the ceiling. The architectural setting is suggested by a decorative frame with pointed arches and columns, and a golden background that implies a sacred or elevated space.",
