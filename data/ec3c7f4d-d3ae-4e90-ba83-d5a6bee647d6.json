    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed female figures stand facing each other. The figure on the left, with flowing hair, wears a draped garment and holds a book. The figure on the right is veiled and also wears a draped garment. Their interaction suggests a moment of communion or recognition. The scene is framed by a decorative border, and the background is dark, suggesting a non-specific or spiritual setting. The presence of halos and the book indicates a religious context, likely depicting saints or biblical figures.",
