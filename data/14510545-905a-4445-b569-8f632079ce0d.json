    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands to the left, gesturing with his right hand. He is dressed in a red cope with gold trim over a white alb. To his right, two men are engaged in an exchange at a wooden table. One man, wearing a blue tunic and orange sleeves, holds his hands up as if in explanation or surprise. The other man, in a yellow tunic and red cap, is counting or handling coins from a bag. A fourth man, in a grey tunic and cap, sits on a stool to the right, observing the transaction. The scene appears to be set outdoors under a thatched roof structure, with a green, leafy background suggesting foliage or a garden.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a transaction involving a bishop, possibly related to tithes, alms, or church finances. The bishop's presence and attire suggest an ecclesiastical authority overseeing or participating in the exchange of money.",
