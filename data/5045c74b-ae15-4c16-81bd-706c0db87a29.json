    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A robed figure, likely a priest, holds the infant Christ on a dark, pedestal-like structure, preparing to perform a ritual. To the left, the Virgin Mary, veiled and in blue, stands with a halo, observing the event. Beside her, an older man, possibly Simeon, holds a staff. Behind the figures, a green curtain suggests an interior setting, possibly within the Temple. The overall scene is framed by a decorative border, typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
