    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female figure, likely a saint or queen, stands in a landscape. She wears a blue mantle adorned with gold motifs over a white garment with a patterned border. She holds an open book with musical notation. Behind her, a stylized tree with green foliage is visible on the left, and a castle with towers and battlements is depicted in the background on the right. The ground is rendered with rolling hills and scattered bushes. A water wheel is partially visible in the lower left corner. The scene is set against a blue sky dotted with small gold flecks, suggesting stars.",
