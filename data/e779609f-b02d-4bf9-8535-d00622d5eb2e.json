    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude woman with long red hair stands in shallow water, her body partially obscured by a patch of brown. Her discarded golden robe lies on the grassy bank behind her. To the left, a tall, ornate golden fountain with spires and decorative medallions rises from a hexagonal base. In the background, a grand complex of buildings with towers, spires, and arched windows is visible, suggesting a city or palace. A colonnade with statues of figures stands in the foreground to the right, and a crowned man looks out from a balcony above. The scene is set outdoors with a clear blue sky.",
