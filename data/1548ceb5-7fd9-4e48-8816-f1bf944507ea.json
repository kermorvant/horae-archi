    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in conversation, set against a backdrop of stylized architecture and a tessellated, jewel-toned sky. On the left, two women stand near a large, arched entryway of a building. The woman in the foreground, dressed in a vibrant blue robe with gold trim, gestures with her right hand. Behind her, another woman in a golden-brown robe looks on. To the right, a third figure, also in a pink robe with blue trim, faces the central figure, appearing to speak or react. The architecture includes a tower with crenellations and a conical roof, and a building with prominent red gabled roofs. The background is a dense mosaic of small squares in shades of blue, red, and gold, suggesting a celestial or richly decorated interior space.",
