    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and halo, holds the Christ Child on her lap. Three Magi, identified by their crowns, approach the Holy Family. The first Magus, an elder with a white beard, kneels and offers a chalice. The second Magus stands behind him, holding a chalice and gesturing with his finger. The third Magus, also crowned, stands to the left, holding a chalice. Behind them is a simple thatched-roof structure, suggesting a humble dwelling. The background features a blue sky with a star, and in the distance, a stylized representation of hills and a building. The scene is framed by ornate architectural elements on the left and right, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
