    "scene_description_enriched": "A tonsured man, likely a monk, is depicted wearing a red robe with blue trim and a white collar. He has a halo, indicating sainthood, and is looking upwards with an expression of devotion or prayer. He appears to be within an architectural setting, suggested by a barred window or grate to his left and a decorative golden frame surrounding the scene. The overall impression is of a saintly figure in contemplation or prayer, possibly within a monastic cell or a place of confinement.",
