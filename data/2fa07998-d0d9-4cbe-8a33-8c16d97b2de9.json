    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, bound to a green column, being scourged by two figures. Christ, with a halo, is partially draped in a white loincloth. One tormentor, on the left, wears a blue tunic and orange leggings, and is blindfolded with a white cloth. He holds a bundle of reeds or branches, ready to strike. The other tormentor, on the right, wears an orange tunic and blue leggings, and appears to be striking Christ with a whip or similar implement. The background is a rich red with gold scrolling ornamentation, framed by an arched border. The floor is a green and white checkered pattern.",
