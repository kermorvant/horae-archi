    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a hilly landscape with a winding path. In the foreground, a group of women, led by the Virgin Mary, approaches a man kneeling with his hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, several figures, likely disciples, are seen walking and conversing on the path. In the middle ground, a small red-roofed building is nestled among trees. In the background, a fortified castle stands on a rocky outcrop, and a city with numerous buildings and a body of water is visible in the distance. The overall scene is rendered with meticulous detail, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination, and conveys a devotional atmosphere.",
