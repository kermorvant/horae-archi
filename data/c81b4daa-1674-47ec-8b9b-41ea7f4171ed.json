    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a table-like structure. On the left, a man in regal attire, possibly a king, holds a swaddled infant. Facing him, a kneeling figure with a halo, likely representing a saint or holy person, reaches out towards the child. Behind the king are several other figures, including women, one of whom carries a basket of fruit. The background features an arched architectural element with decorative tracery and a diamond-patterned window. The overall setting suggests a formal presentation or religious event within an interior space.",
