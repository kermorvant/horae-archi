    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and bleeding, standing in what appears to be water. He is partially draped in a white loincloth. In his left hand, he holds a bundle of twigs or reeds, and in his right, a green palm frond and a scourge. Behind him, a wooden cross is visible, along with a ladder leaning against it. A spear is positioned to the left of Christ, and the scourge to the right. The background is a textured gold, framed by an arched border with decorative elements, including a strawberry at the top right. The blue forms at the sides suggest water or a stylized representation of the sea.",
