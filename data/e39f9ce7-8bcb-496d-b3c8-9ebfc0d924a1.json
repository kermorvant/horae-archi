    "scene_description_enriched": "A young man with clasped hands and a solemn expression stands to the left, facing a bishop who is adorned in a mitre and cope, holding a crozier. The bishop raises his right hand, seemingly in blessing or instruction. The background on the left depicts a grey wall with vertical lines suggesting wooden panels or pilasters, and a red rectangular motif. The background on the right is a blue curtain with vertical gold lines. The scene appears to be an interior setting, possibly a room or a chapel.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a bishop offering spiritual guidance or a blessing to a supplicant. This could represent a moment of confession, absolution, or a pastoral encounter, common themes in devotional literature and art.",
