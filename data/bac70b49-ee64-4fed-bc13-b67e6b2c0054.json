    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher wading through a body of water, carrying the Christ Child on his shoulders. Saint Christopher, a large, bearded man with a halo, is dressed in a blue cloak over a golden tunic and is holding a tall staff. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is seated on his shoulders, looking upwards. The water is depicted with ripples and small fish. The background features rolling green hills, a body of water with islands, and a small building with a tower and arched windows in the distance. The overall impression is one of a perilous journey across a river.",
