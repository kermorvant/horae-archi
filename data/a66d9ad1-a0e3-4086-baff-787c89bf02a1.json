    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of the Virgin Mary in the Temple. A bearded man, likely a priest, sits on a raised dais, pointing with his right hand. Before him, the Virgin Mary, depicted with a halo and praying hands, is being presented. She is dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold stars and a crown. Two angels with blue wings and pink robes attend to her, one placing a crown on her head and another holding her robe. To the left, a young girl in a yellow tunic stands, holding a blue cloth. In the background, architectural elements suggest an interior space with arched doorways and a vaulted ceiling. The overall scene is rich with devotional symbolism, highlighting Mary's purity and her destined role.",
