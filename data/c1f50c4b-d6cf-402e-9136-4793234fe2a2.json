    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a beard and long hair, wearing a blue tunic and a red robe with gold trim, sits and writes in a book placed on a lectern. He has a halo and appears to be dictating or composing. Beside him stands a woman with blonde hair, also with a halo, holding an open book. She wears a white robe and looks towards the man. Behind them, a green, wing-like form suggests a divine presence, possibly an angel, and a grey, textured background hints at an interior space.",
