The figure on the left, wearing a white alb and a green stole, holds a processional cross or staff. The figure on the right, also in clerical attire, holds an open book and a blue vessel, possibly a ewer. Behind the altar, a white cross stands against a gold, diamond-patterned background. Three candlesticks with unlit candles are placed on the altar.",
