    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bishop, identified by his mitre and halo, being martyred. He is bound to a chair or structure, with two figures on either side. The figure on the left, wearing a cap and tunic, appears to be holding a tool or rope. The figure on the right, dressed in darker robes and a hat, also seems to be involved in the torment. Arrows are depicted piercing the bishop's torso. The background shows a landscape visible through an arched opening, suggesting an indoor setting with a view to the outside. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern. This scene is likely the martyrdom of Saint Erasmus of Formia, who was traditionally martyred by evisceration, often depicted with arrows.",
