    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered indoors, centered around a woman in a blue robe who is the focal point. She has a golden halo and her hands are raised in a gesture of speaking or blessing. Surrounding her are several other figures, also with golden halos, some wearing red, green, and pink robes. The figures are seated or kneeling on a floor with a checkered pattern. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior space, with arches and what appear to be windows with a diamond lattice pattern. The overall impression is one of a significant religious gathering.",
