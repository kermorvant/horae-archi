    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Evangelist, identifiable by his halo and beard, seated and engrossed in reading and writing. He is dressed in a white tunic and a red and blue mantle, with his legs crossed. An angel, also with a halo and wings, hovers to the left, holding an open book and looking towards Saint John. The setting appears to be an interior space, possibly a study or a room within a religious building, characterized by rich drapery, a large ornate desk with books and a vase, and a window with diamond-shaped panes in the background. The overall impression is one of divine inspiration and scholarly pursuit, with the angel acting as a messenger or source of divine knowledge.",
