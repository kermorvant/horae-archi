    "scene_description_enriched": "Two women, one in a reddish-brown robe and the other in a golden-brown robe, are shown holding a swaddled infant. The woman on the left cradles the baby, while the woman on the right supports it. They stand on a green grassy bank beside a body of water depicted with wavy lines. Behind them, the sky is a deep blue with scattered yellow cloud-like formations. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with no discernible architectural structures.",
