    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, with her lying on a richly decorated bed under a canopy. A group of figures, likely apostles and other mourners, surround her. One figure, possibly a priest, is anointing her. In the foreground, two bearded men are seated, one reading a book and the other in contemplation. The architectural setting is suggested by columns and decorative elements, implying an indoor space, possibly a room within a religious building or a domestic setting adapted for the event.",
