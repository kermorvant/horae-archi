    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a forest setting with several figures. On the left, two men are engaged in felling trees with axes. The man in the foreground wears a blue tunic and red hose, while the man behind him wears a green tunic. Their actions suggest labor and industry. In the background, a body of water is visible, possibly a lake or river, with a distant shoreline. On the right, a group of men, distinguished by their elaborate headwear and rich attire, observe the woodcutters. The central figure among them, draped in a golden cloak over a red garment, gestures towards the workers. This scene likely represents a biblical narrative or a devotional theme related to labor and observation, possibly illustrating a parable or a historical event.",
