    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king, with a long grey beard, kneels in prayer before an altar. He wears a blue tunic and an orange mantle lined with ermine, and a golden bell hangs from his belt. The altar is adorned with a book, a pitcher, and a candlestick. Behind the altar, a rich red tapestry with gold patterns serves as a backdrop. To the left, a white architectural structure with arches and columns frames the scene. In the upper part of the image, God the Father, depicted with a beard and halo, blesses the scene from a celestial realm, from which rays of light descend towards a distant city with spires and a river. The overall scene suggests a moment of divine revelation or intercession.",
