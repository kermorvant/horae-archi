    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, seated and holding the Christ Child, is presented with a sprig of flowers by an angel. The scene takes place within a room that opens to an exterior landscape. Above the figures, a celestial sky with stars and a radiant sunburst is depicted, suggesting a divine setting. The Virgin wears a blue mantle over a red garment, and the Christ Child is in a brown tunic. The angel, with blue wings, is robed in brown and kneels before them. The room features a patterned wall and a tiled floor, with a bed canopy visible in the background. The overall scene evokes a sense of divine grace and the presentation of innocence.",
