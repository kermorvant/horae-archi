    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a haloed man with a long beard and wavy hair, dressed in a draped garment. He is accompanied by a bull, whose head is positioned next to the man's shoulder. The man's left hand rests on his chest, while his right hand points downwards. Above the figures, small circles are scattered, possibly representing stars or celestial bodies. Below the figures, a band of text is visible, followed by an ornamental border with scrolling foliage. The scene is likely an allegorical representation or a depiction of a saint associated with a bull.",
