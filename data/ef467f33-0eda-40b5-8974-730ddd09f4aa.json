    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King Solomon seated on a throne, holding a sword. Before him, a soldier, clad in armor and a blue cap, raises a sword over a baby. A woman, dressed in a yellow gown and white head covering, holds the baby and appears to be pleading. The setting is an interior space with a tiled floor, arched doorways, and windows with tracery. The architectural elements suggest a royal or judicial chamber. This scene illustrates the biblical story of King Solomon's judgment, where he proposes to divide a disputed child between two women claiming to be its mother, a test designed to reveal the true mother by her maternal instinct.",
