    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, some with halos, are gathered indoors. In the foreground, a woman in a blue robe and white headdress, with a halo, holds a lit candle. Beside her, another woman, also with a halo, wears a blue garment and holds the candle. To their right, a man with a beard and halo clasps his hands in prayer, holding a feather. Behind them, several other figures with halos are visible, their faces turned towards the center. The background features a richly patterned tapestry and blue drapery, suggesting an interior setting, possibly a chamber or a chapel.",
