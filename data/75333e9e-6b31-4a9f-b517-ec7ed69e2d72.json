    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian. A young man, identified as Saint Sebastian, stands bound to a tree trunk, his body pierced by multiple arrows. He is depicted with a halo, indicating his sainthood. Several men are actively involved in his torment: one man, dressed in blue and wearing a red and white striped hat, pulls an arrow from Saint Sebastian's side, while another, in a blue hooded robe, holds a scroll and appears to be directing the execution. Other figures in the background are also shown with bows and arrows, suggesting they are part of the executioners. The setting is an outdoor landscape with green grass and a blue sky.",
