    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint, stands in the foreground holding a staff in her left hand and a blue, gold-embossed book in her right. She wears a golden gown with a white mantle draped over her shoulders. Above and behind her, a winged demon with dark scales and red eyes hovers menacingly. To the left, a building with red roofs and white walls is nestled in a landscape with rolling blue hills. To the right, a more elaborate stone structure, possibly a castle or fortified building, is depicted with crenellated walls and towers. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with a path leading into the distance.",
