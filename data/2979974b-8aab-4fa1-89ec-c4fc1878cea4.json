    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, identified by the inscription \"math\" and \"reu\" (likely \"Matthaeus\" or \"Matthew\"), stands in a verdant landscape. He is dressed in a blue robe and a pink mantle lined with white fur. In his left hand, he holds an open book, and in his right, a palm frond, a common symbol of martyrdom. The background features rolling green hills and scattered trees, suggesting an outdoor setting. The entire scene is framed within a circular border adorned with gold leaf and red floral motifs.",
