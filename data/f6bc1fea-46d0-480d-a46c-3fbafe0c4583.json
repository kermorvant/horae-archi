    "scene_description_enriched": "A winged lion, a symbol of Saint Mark, stands to the left of a haloed man who is seated and writing on a scroll. The man, likely Saint Mark, wears a turban and a flowing robe adorned with gold. He is positioned in an interior space with a bookshelf filled with books behind him. The lion has a furry body, prominent wings, and sharp teeth. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded architectural element, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
