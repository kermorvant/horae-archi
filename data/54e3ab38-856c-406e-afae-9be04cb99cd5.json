    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, cradles the body of Christ, whose wounds are visible. To her left, a figure in a pink robe, likely Saint John the Evangelist, supports Christ's head. Below them, a figure in a red robe, possibly Mary Magdalene, kneels and reaches out towards Christ's feet. The background is a rich red with gold ornamentation, suggesting a divine or sacred setting, and rays emanate from behind the figures, further emphasizing the spiritual nature of the event. The ground beneath them is rendered in green and yellow hues.",
