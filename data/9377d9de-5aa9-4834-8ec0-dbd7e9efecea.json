    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king, identifiable by his crown and ornate golden robe, engaged in conversation with a robed figure who appears to be a prophet or religious advisor. The king gestures with his hands, seemingly in supplication or inquiry. Behind the king, a group of men in varied attire observe the interaction. In the background, a large castle with multiple towers and red-tiled roofs is visible, set against a landscape of rolling hills and a pale blue sky. The ground is green and dotted with stylized trees and foliage highlighted with gold leaf. The overall impression is one of a significant encounter between royalty and spiritual counsel, possibly within a royal court or a place of importance.",
