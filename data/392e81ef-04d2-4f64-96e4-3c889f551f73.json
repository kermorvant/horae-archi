    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a halo, is seated on a throne, holding the Christ Child on her lap. She wears a blue robe, and the throne is adorned with a red, gold-patterned canopy and decorative elements. The scene is framed by arched architectural elements, revealing a landscape with mountains and sky through openings on either side. The overall impression is one of regal dignity and maternal tenderness, set within a stylized, somewhat abstract architectural space.",
