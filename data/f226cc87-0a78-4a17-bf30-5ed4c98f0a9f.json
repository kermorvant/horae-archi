    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is seated on an ornate throne, draped in a golden-orange robe and a white veil. She is holding a small, lantern-like object in her left hand and pointing with her right index finger towards it. The throne is decorated with miniature figures in niches, including a crowned king and standing women. Behind her, a blue tapestry with gold fleur-de-lis is visible. The background features a colonnade with alternating red and gold columns, suggesting an interior architectural setting. A coiled green serpent with a reptilian head lies at the foot of the throne. The scene is framed by elaborate gold microarchitecture on the sides.",
