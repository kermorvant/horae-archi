    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a halo and veiled head, stands and holds a shroud or veil. On this veil is the face of Christ, also with a halo, appearing as a bust. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting a niche or canopy, with decorative arches and what appear to be miniature towers or pinnacles. The overall impression is a devotional image of the Veil of Veronica or a similar representation of Christ's suffering.",
