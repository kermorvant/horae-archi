    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, stands to the left, holding the infant Jesus. Joseph, identifiable by his halo and beard, stands behind Mary. To the right, an elderly man, likely Simeon, dressed in a golden robe, holds the infant Jesus on a white cloth atop a patterned table. Another figure, possibly Anna, stands behind Mary, and a man in a distinctive blue robe and pointed hat stands to the far right. The background features a grand architectural setting with arched openings and columns, suggesting the interior of a temple or church. A red canopy with gold trim is suspended above the scene. The figures are richly robed, and gold leaf is used extensively for halos and decorative elements.",
