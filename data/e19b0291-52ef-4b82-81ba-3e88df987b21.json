    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious service within a vaulted architectural space. Two figures in white robes and head coverings stand behind an altar covered with an orange cloth adorned with golden motifs. They are engaged in reading from a large book. In the foreground, a figure in a green hooded cloak stands with their back to the viewer, facing the altar. To the left, a tall, ornate candlestick with a lit yellow and red candle stands prominently. The floor is a checkered pattern of black and cream squares. The vaulted ceiling is rendered in pinkish-red with intricate ribbing, and a small window with tracery is visible in the background.",
