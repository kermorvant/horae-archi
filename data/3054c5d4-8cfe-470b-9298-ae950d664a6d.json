    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure, identified as a saint by her halo, stands within an architectural setting. She wears a red gown, a green tunic, and a blue mantle. Her hair is blonde and styled in curls. She holds a book in her left arm and a quill in her right hand, suggesting she is a scribe or a scholar. Behind her, a red tapestry with gold floral motifs is visible. Above the tapestry, an arched opening reveals a glimpse of a building interior with tall, narrow windows, possibly indicating a church or a grand hall. The floor is depicted as a green checkered pattern.",
