    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a woman based on the attire and hairstyle, is depicted holding a staff or scepter in her left hand. She wears a distinctive headdress with tassels and a flowing garment adorned with decorative buttons and a belt. Her right hand is raised, with the index finger extended, as if pointing or gesturing. The background is abstract, with vertical lines suggesting drapery or foliage, and scattered circular motifs that could represent snow or abstract decorative elements. The overall impression is of a symbolic or allegorical representation rather than a specific narrative scene.",
