    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with long blond hair and a beard, wearing a blue tunic, white hose, and a red cloak lined with gold, sits on the ground, holding a long staff. He is looking towards a group of three wild boars foraging in a wooded area. The background depicts a landscape with rolling hills and trees under a blue sky. The scene is likely a depiction of Saint Anthony Abbot, known for his asceticism and his temptations in the desert, often represented with animals.",
