    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit, with a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descending from a blue celestial area, radiating golden light and wavy lines downwards. Below, a group of ten figures, all with golden halos, are gathered. They are seated on a curved wooden bench. The figures are dressed in various colored robes, including blue, pink, brown, and orange. Their hands are raised in supplication or awe, and their gazes are directed upwards towards the divine light. The floor beneath them is decorated with a geometric pattern of green and black squares. The overall setting is abstract, focusing on the spiritual event rather than a specific architectural or natural environment.",
