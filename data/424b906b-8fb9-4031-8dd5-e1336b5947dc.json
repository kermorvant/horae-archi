    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A bishop, wearing a mitre and ornate vestments, holds the Christ Child, who is presented on a table draped with white cloth. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, stands to the left of the table, looking towards the child. Joseph, also with a halo, stands behind Mary. Several other figures, including women with hoods and a man in the background, are present. The setting appears to be an interior space with architectural elements such as columns, arches, and windows revealing a landscape with buildings in the distance. The floor is tiled in green and grey.",
