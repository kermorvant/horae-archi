    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, meeting Elizabeth, who is dressed in a pink garment and a white veil. They are shown in a landscape setting with architectural elements in the background. To the left, a blue structure with a rounded archway is visible, suggesting a building entrance. In the center, a grey domed structure rises, possibly part of a larger edifice. The background features rolling hills, trees, and a cityscape with spires. Rays of golden light descend from the top of the frame, symbolizing divine intervention. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sanctity.",
