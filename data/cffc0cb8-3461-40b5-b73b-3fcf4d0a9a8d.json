She wears a blue robe with gold trim and a white headdress. The Christ Child is swaddled and also has a halo. To the left, Saint Joseph, with a white beard and wearing a red cloak over a pink tunic and blue hose, leads the donkey. He holds a staff and appears to be playing a pipe. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, sparse trees, and a distant, indistinct cityscape. The sky is a gradient of blue and silver.",
