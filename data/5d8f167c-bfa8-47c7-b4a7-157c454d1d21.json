    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal figure, likely God the Father, seated on a throne and gesturing towards the Virgin Mary, who stands with hands clasped in prayer. Above them, an angel descends, holding a crown. To the left of the Virgin, another angel plays a harp. To the right of the throne, a kneeling angel holds a book. The background features a richly patterned tapestry and a celestial blue sky with golden stars. The overall composition suggests a divine coronation or investiture of the Virgin Mary.",
