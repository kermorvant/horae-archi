    "scene_description_enriched": "A female saint, identified by her halo and the palm frond she holds, stands in a verdant outdoor setting. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a pink gown and holds an open book, suggesting scholarly or devotional engagement. To her right stands a grey, multi-tiered tower with a conical roof topped by a flag. The background features a red textile with a repeating pattern of stylized leaves and a blue celestial expanse dotted with gold stars. The inscription at the bottom, 'S. Barbara', confirms her identity. The scene likely depicts Saint Barbara, a Christian martyr often associated with towers due to her legend of being imprisoned in one.",
