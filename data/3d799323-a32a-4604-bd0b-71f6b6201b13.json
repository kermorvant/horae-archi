    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle, cradles the lifeless body of Christ, who is wrapped in a white shroud. Christ's wounds are visible, including stigmata on his hands and feet, and a wound in his side. To the left, a figure in a reddish-gold robe and purple tunic, likely Saint John the Evangelist, supports Christ's legs. To the right, a figure in a reddish-gold robe and purple mantle, likely Mary Magdalene, kneels with hands clasped in prayer. Behind them, a large wooden cross stands, bearing the inscription \"INRI\" at the top. The background features a blue sky with stylized clouds, rolling hills, and sparse greenery, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sanctity.",
