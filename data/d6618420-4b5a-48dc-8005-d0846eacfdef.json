    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a decorative circular frame. On the left, an angel, identified by wings and a halo, is shown in profile, wearing a red robe. A scroll unfurls from his hand, bearing the inscription \"AVE MARIA G[RATIA PLENA]\". Facing the angel on the right is the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, dressed in a blue mantle over a red gown. She holds a book and a bouquet of flowers, her hands raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. Behind her, a stylized architectural element resembling a screen or a bed canopy is visible. The background is a patterned tapestry of diamonds in blue, red, and gold. The overall composition is enclosed within a large, ornamental letter 'C'.",
