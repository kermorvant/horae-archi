    "scene_description_enriched": "Three men are depicted in an outdoor setting, engaged in the activity of sawing a piece of wood. The central figure, with a beard and wearing a hat, holds one end of the saw, while the man to his left, also wearing a cap, holds the other end. The man on the right, wearing a hood, appears to be assisting or observing. Behind them, a stylized tree with dense foliage is visible, and in the background, simplified architectural structures with arched openings and gabled roofs are suggested. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with strong outlines and hatching for shading.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a secular activity, possibly representing a craft or labor, rather than a specific biblical or religious event. Without further context or iconographic clues, a precise religious interpretation is not possible.",
