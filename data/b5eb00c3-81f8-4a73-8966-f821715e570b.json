    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue robe and white veil, holds the Christ Child. One of the Magi, kneeling, offers a golden chalice filled with what appears to be gold coins. Another Magus, standing and dressed in blue, holds a golden vessel and points towards the child. A third Magus, also standing, presents a golden monstrance-like object. Behind them, a group of onlookers and attendants are gathered, some on horseback. The architectural setting is a humble stable, with a wooden structure and a thatched roof visible. In the background, a walled city with towers is depicted on rolling hills under a blue sky with a sun.",
