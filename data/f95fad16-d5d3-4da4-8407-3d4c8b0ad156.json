A golden eagle, a symbol of his evangelistic work, pecks at a scroll he is writing. To his left, a winged demon pours liquid from a jug into a quiver, representing temptation and worldly distractions. In the background, a lush landscape unfolds with trees, houses, and distant castles and churches, suggesting the world from which John is divinely inspired.",
