    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in a blue cope over a red and gold chasuble. He raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing or teaching. To his left, a group of three figures, possibly children or supplicants, are depicted within a carved architectural niche, one with hands clasped in prayer. The scene is framed by an architectural canopy with pointed arches and decorative tracery, suggesting an interior setting within a religious or noble context. The background shows a window with a pale blue sky visible through it.",
