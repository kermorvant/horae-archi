    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, holding the Christ Child, riding on a donkey. She is accompanied by two figures. To her left, a young man plays a pipe, and to her right, another man, possibly Joseph, leads the donkey. In the background, a man is shown near a well or cistern, drawing water. The figures are set against a patterned red background, with a green, grassy foreground. The overall scene suggests a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or a similar pilgrimage.",
