In his left hand, he holds a book, and in his right, a scroll or rod. To his left, flames rise from the ground, and to his right, a creature resembling a dragon or a dog emerges from foliage. The background features a starry sky within an arched architectural frame, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The overall scene likely depicts a saint associated with overcoming evil or heresy, possibly Saint Lawrence or Saint Jerome, given the presence of flames and a beast.",
