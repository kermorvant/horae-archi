    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, depicted as a pilgrim, stands in a landscape. He wears a blue robe, a red and green mantle, and a wide-brimmed hat. He holds a staff in his right hand and an open book in his left. A black bag hangs from his left shoulder. In the background, a body of water separates the foreground from a city with towers and walls. The figure's halo suggests he is a saint. The scene likely depicts a saintly pilgrim, possibly Saint James the Greater, given the iconography of pilgrimage.",
