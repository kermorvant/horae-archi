    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession is depicted moving across a green landscape with a city in the background. In the foreground, several figures are visible. On the left, a group of men in richly colored robes, one wearing a crown and with hands clasped in prayer, appear to be part of the procession. To the right, two figures in ornate golden robes, likely clergy, carry a large, intricately decorated reliquary on a wooden beam. The reliquary is shaped like a miniature building with a steep, tiled roof and golden ornamentation. In the distance, a city skyline is rendered with various buildings, including a prominent domed structure and numerous towers and spires. The scene likely represents a religious procession, possibly carrying a sacred relic, within or near a city.",
