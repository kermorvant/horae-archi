    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, bleeding from his wounds. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle and veiled, stands with her hands clasped in prayer, surrounded by other mourners. To the right, a man with a beard and a red robe gestures, while a younger man in armor and a blue tunic, mounted on a white horse, looks towards the cross. In the background, a stylized landscape with rolling hills and distant castles under a blue sky dotted with gold stars completes the scene. The entire image is framed by an ornate, gilded arch with blue and gold decorative elements.",
