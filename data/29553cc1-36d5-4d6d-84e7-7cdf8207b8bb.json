    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within a circular frame, set against a dark background with wavy lines suggesting water. On the left, a figure with blonde hair, wearing a tunic and hose, bends down and reaches out to another figure. The second figure, also in a tunic, is partially submerged in the water and appears to be falling or being pulled down. Two stylized trees with bushy tops are visible behind the figures. The overall composition suggests a dramatic event occurring in an outdoor, watery setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely illustrates the story of the miraculous recovery of a lost axe head from the Jordan River by the prophet Elisha, as recounted in 2 Kings 6:1-7. The figure on the left would represent Elisha, and the figure in the water, a disciple. The axe head falling into the water and Elisha causing it to float would be the central miracle.",
