    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, seated and breastfeeding the Christ Child, who is looking towards the viewer. To the left, a monk in a white habit kneels in prayer before a stone altar. Behind the monk, a woman in a black headdress and dark dress looks on with a gentle expression. The figures are framed by classical columns and arches, suggesting an architectural setting. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills and trees is visible. Scrolls with Latin inscriptions are draped across the scene, adding a textual layer to the visual narrative. The overall composition suggests a devotional scene, likely a prayer or meditation on the Virgin and Child, with the monk as the intercessor.",
