    "scene_description_enriched": "Two figures, identified by their halos as saints, are depicted. The figure on the left, a woman, cradles a swaddled infant. The figure on the right, an older man with a beard, leans forward, looking at the infant and touching it with his hand. Both figures are dressed in flowing robes. The scene is framed by an elaborate decorative border featuring scrolling foliage and floral motifs, set against a dark background. The overall impression is one of tenderness and reverence, suggesting a devotional scene.",
