    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, kneels in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a manger. Behind them, a cow and an ox are visible within a stable-like structure. To the right, Joseph, wearing a yellow tunic and pink robe, looks upwards and gestures towards the sky. The background shows a landscape with rolling hills and a blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting beyond the immediate shelter.",
