    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. Saint Joseph, with a beard and long hair, walks to the left, holding a staff and leading a donkey. The Virgin Mary is seated on the donkey, holding the Christ Child. She is swaddled and has a halo. The background features a lush green landscape with trees and a distant cityscape with blue buildings. To the right, a golden, ornate structure resembling a candelabrum or a decorative column stands, possibly symbolizing a religious element or a marker. The overall impression is one of travel and pilgrimage.",
