    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a beard and long hair, dressed in a red robe and blue sleeves, kneels in a landscape. He gazes upwards with his hands outstretched in prayer. In the background, a walled city with towers and spires is visible on a hill. Above him, in the sky, a bust of Christ is depicted with a halo and rays of light emanating from him, holding a globe. To the right of the kneeling man, a globe rests on a decorative stand, and a harp is placed on the ground. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
