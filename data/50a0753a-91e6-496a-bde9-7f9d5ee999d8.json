    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher wading through a river, carrying the Christ Child on his shoulders. Saint Christopher, a bearded man with a halo, is dressed in a pink robe and green cloak, leaning on a staff as he navigates the water. The Christ Child, also with a halo, sits on his shoulders, holding a globe and looking upwards. The background features a blue sky with clouds, and on either side, stylized trees and rocky terrain suggest an outdoor setting. The image is framed by a decorative border.",
