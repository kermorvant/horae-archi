Saint Joseph, wearing a red robe and blue hat, walks behind them, looking weary. In the background, a procession of figures follows, some on horseback. A windmill and buildings are visible in the distance, suggesting a journey through a rural landscape. The scene is framed by an ornate border with floral motifs.",
