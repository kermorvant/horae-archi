    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts three figures, two of whom are crowned and appear to be engaged in conversation or prayer. The figure on the left, wearing a tall, ornate crown, looks upwards and to the right. The figure on the right, also crowned, looks upwards and to the left, with hands clasped in prayer. Between them, a third figure, wearing a simpler headband, looks forward with a neutral expression. All figures have halos, suggesting a religious context. The clothing is detailed with folds and decorative elements, including belts with buckles. The scene is framed by a border, and the background is plain, focusing attention on the figures.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of halos and crowns on multiple figures, along with the clasped hands, suggests a scene of veneration or a depiction of holy figures, possibly saints or royalty in a devotional context. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical event is not definitively identifiable, but it likely relates to a moment of prayer, supplication, or divine revelation involving crowned individuals.",
