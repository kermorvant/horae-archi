    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within an architectural setting. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue robe and halo, cradles the Christ Child, who is also haloed and appears nude. They are seated on a cushioned surface. To the left, three figures are present: an older woman in a red and blue robe with a head covering, holding a dark object; a younger man in a green robe, with hands clasped in prayer; and another figure in a red and purple robe, kneeling. The background is dark and textured, suggesting an interior space, with a golden, arched frame adorned with floral motifs surrounding the scene. A richly patterned red textile hangs on the right.",
