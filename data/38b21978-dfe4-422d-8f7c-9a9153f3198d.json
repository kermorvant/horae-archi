    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Jesus, barefoot and clad in a purple robe, speaking to a group of people. To his left, two men in green and yellow robes listen intently, one pointing. To his right, a woman kneels, her hands clasped over her chest, dressed in a yellow tunic and blue robe. Behind her, two men, one in a red robe and the other in a white garment, observe. The setting appears to be a rocky, cave-like environment with sparse vegetation. The inscription at the bottom suggests a religious context, likely related to a biblical narrative.",
