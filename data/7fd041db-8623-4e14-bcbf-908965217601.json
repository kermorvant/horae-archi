    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, identified as Christ, stands with his eyes closed and hands clasped in prayer. He is depicted with a beard and long hair, and wears a purple tunic with gold trim and a red mantle, also with gold trim. A golden halo surrounds his head, and rays emanate from it. Above him, a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends with its wings spread, also surrounded by golden rays. The background is a bright blue sky, with a suggestion of a barren, rocky landscape below. To the right, a decorative border with red scrollwork on a gold background frames the scene. The overall impression is one of spiritual contemplation and divine presence.",
