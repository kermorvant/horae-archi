    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures are depicted within an architectural setting. The central figure, an elderly man with a long white beard, wears a blue robe adorned with gold patterns and a tall, cylindrical hat. He holds a golden staff and is kneeling on a raised platform. Behind him, two other figures, one wearing a brown cap and the other a monk's habit, appear to be supporting or attending to him. The architecture consists of columns and arches, suggesting an interior space, possibly a hall or a chamber within a larger building. The scene is framed by decorative elements, including a red crenellated border at the top.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a figure of authority or religious significance, possibly a king, prophet, or elder, in a moment of prayer, contemplation, or receiving counsel. The presence of monks suggests a religious context. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or devotional event cannot be definitively identified, but it evokes themes of wisdom, leadership, and spiritual guidance.",
