    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity, with the Virgin Mary reclining on a bed, her head propped up and her hand reaching out. She is swaddled in a blue robe and wears a white veil. Beside her, a cradle contains the Christ Child, also swaddled and with a halo. A woman in an orange dress stands behind the cradle, attending to the child. To the left of the Virgin, an elderly man with a beard sits, holding a white cloth. In the background, a cow and a donkey are visible, their heads peering over the manger. The setting appears to be a stable, indicated by the presence of animals and a rudimentary shelter with a thatched roof. A fire burns in a small brazier on the left, and a vessel with cups is on the right, suggesting domestic elements within the stable.",
