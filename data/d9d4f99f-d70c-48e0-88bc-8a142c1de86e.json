    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of people in a landscape, engaged in gathering food from baskets. In the foreground, several individuals, including a man in a blue tunic and yellow sleeves, a woman in a red dress and white veil, and another woman in a blue gown, are shown collecting items from baskets. A young boy in a red tunic and blue hose is also seen carrying a basket. In the background, a man with a long white beard, dressed in a blue robe with a red mantle, holds a book and gestures with his hand. He appears to be leading or instructing the others. The landscape is rendered with rolling hills, trees, and a distant city or settlement under a blue sky with birds. The overall impression is one of communal activity and divine guidance.",
