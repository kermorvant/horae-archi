    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, stands in a landscape. The figure wears a reddish-brown robe with gold trim over a white undergarment. In their left hand, they hold an open book, and in their right, a grid-like object, possibly a gridiron, a symbol of martyrdom. The background is a stylized blue sky with scattered gold dots, and a green, rolling hill. The figure's gaze is directed downwards, and their expression is serene. The presence of the gridiron suggests this is a depiction of Saint Lawrence.",
