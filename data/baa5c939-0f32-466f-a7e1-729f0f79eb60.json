He is accompanied by a group of men in colorful attire, some wearing red and blue hats. Facing the king is a bearded man in a white hooded robe, also gesturing. The setting is outdoors, with rolling hills and a distant city with towers and spires visible on the right. Lush green trees with gold accents dot the landscape. The ground is a sandy path with faint markings that could represent footprints or debris.",
