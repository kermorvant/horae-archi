    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a figure, likely Christ, with a halo, being presented to a seated figure wearing a green hat and blue robes. Christ is dressed in a simple grey robe and appears to be looking downwards with a sorrowful expression. He is flanked by several armored soldiers holding spears and axes. The seated figure, possibly a judge or authority figure, gestures towards Christ. The setting is an interior space with a richly patterned red and gold tapestry in the background and a tiled floor. The architecture is suggested by a pink wall with recessed panels and a doorway-like structure on the right.",
