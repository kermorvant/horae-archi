    "scene_description_enriched": "Two female saints, identified by their halos, stand in a verdant landscape. The saint on the left, dressed in a pink gown and blue mantle, gently touches a white lamb. The saint on the right, in a golden gown and purple mantle, holds a model of a tower with a red conical roof. In the background, rolling hills are dotted with trees and crowned with fortified castles. A shepherd tends to his flock on one hill, while another figure stands near a castle on a distant ridge. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of the lamb strongly suggests the saint is Agnes of Rome, a virgin martyr often depicted with this attribute. The tower held by the other saint could symbolize a place of refuge or imprisonment, or perhaps a church dedicated to her. The overall scene likely represents the martyrdom or life of Saint Agnes.",
