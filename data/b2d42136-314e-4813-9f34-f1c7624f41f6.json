    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in a verdant, rocky landscape. The woman on the left wears a blue mantle over a golden robe, while the woman on the right is clad in a white veil and a pinkish-blue robe. They are shown in close proximity, with their hands touching. Above them, a divine light descends from a red, ribbed form in the sky, represented by golden rays. In the background, a body of water is visible, with a small boat sailing on it, and on the left, a fortified castle with towers stands on a rocky outcrop. The overall setting suggests a significant event occurring outdoors.",
