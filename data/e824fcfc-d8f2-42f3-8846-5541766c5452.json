    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man, likely Saint Jerome, kneels on a green floor, dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold patterns. He is writing on a scroll, with a quill in his right hand. To his left, a golden dog stands attentively. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior space, with a blue tapestry featuring gold motifs behind the man and a green window visible in the background. A red and gold canopy is suggested above the man, and decorative columns with red and blue elements frame the right side of the image.",
