    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded male figures stand within an architectural frame. The figure on the left wears a reddish-brown robe with gold trim and a blue undergarment, holding a book. He also carries a staff topped with a crescent moon-like symbol. The figure on the right is draped in a dark grey cloak over a green garment. Both figures have halos, suggesting they are saints or important religious figures. The scene is framed by an arch decorated with gold ornamentation, and the background is a vibrant blue sky with stylized clouds. The presence of halos and the book suggests a religious context, possibly depicting saints or biblical figures.",
