    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures, a man and a woman, standing against a dark blue background adorned with golden fleur-de-lis. The man on the left wears a red tunic with gold trim, a blue collar, and a yellow hat. He holds a harp in his left hand and gestures with his right towards a scroll unfurled between the two figures. The scroll contains black Gothic script. The woman on the right wears a blue robe and an orange-gold mantle. She holds a golden chalice in her right hand and gestures with her left towards the scroll. The background suggests a rich textile or tapestry, possibly indicating a royal or noble setting. The overall impression is one of solemnity and perhaps a theological or prophetic dialogue.",
