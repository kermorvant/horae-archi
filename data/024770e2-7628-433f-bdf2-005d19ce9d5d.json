    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts two birds in a naturalistic setting. The foreground shows a bird with grey plumage, its head bent down to graze on green grass. Its legs are red and its feet have three visible toes. Behind it, another bird, lighter in color, stands with its long neck extended upwards and its beak open, as if calling out. Both birds are rendered with detailed feathering. The background features stylized foliage with small, dark circular fruits or buds, and a single blue flower. The overall impression is of a pastoral scene, possibly illustrating a natural history element or a symbolic representation within a devotional context.",
