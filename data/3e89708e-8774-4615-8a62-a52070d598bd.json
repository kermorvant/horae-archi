    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony, likely the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, with a bishop in full regalia holding the Christ Child. The Virgin Mary, kneeling, extends her hands towards the child. Behind them, a group of figures, including a bearded man in a monk's habit and several women, observe the event. The background suggests an interior space with a stone wall and Gothic windows. A richly decorated canopy hovers over the bishop and child, and a green draped table is present. One woman holds a basket containing two doves, a common offering in temple presentations.",
