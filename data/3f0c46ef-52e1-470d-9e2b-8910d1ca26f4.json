    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in profile, facing left. The leftmost figure wears a hood and has a beard. The central figure is distinguished by a wide-brimmed hat and a beard, and is draped in a cloak. The rightmost figure wears a crown or elaborate headdress and a richly patterned tunic. The figures are rendered in a woodcut style with strong linework, and the background is hatched, suggesting an interior or a dimly lit space. Without further context or identifying attributes, the specific narrative or devotional meaning of this grouping of figures remains unclear.",
