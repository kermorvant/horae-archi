    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a woman kneels, holding a key-like object. She is dressed in a patterned robe with a high collar. To her right, another woman, possibly the Virgin Mary given her halo and the book she holds, also kneels. She is draped in a mantle over a dark garment. Behind them, two arched windows with tracery are visible, suggesting an interior space. The overall impression is one of a devotional scene, possibly related to the Visitation or a saint's life.",
