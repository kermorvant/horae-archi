    "scene_description_enriched": "This image depicts a vertical ornamental border, likely from a medieval manuscript. The border is filled with stylized foliate motifs and what appears to be a representation of a serpent or dragon coiled and intertwined with the foliage. In the lower section, a human-like figure, possibly a king or a warrior, is depicted. This figure is shown from the waist up, wearing armor or ornate clothing, and holding a long staff or spear. The overall impression is one of a decorative element rather than a narrative scene, with the figure and serpentine forms integrated into a complex, organic design.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image does not depict a specific religious or biblical scene. It is an ornamental border, likely intended to frame text or an illustration within a Book of Hours or similar manuscript. The motifs, including the foliate patterns and the serpentine form, are common decorative elements in medieval art, often carrying symbolic meanings related to nature, temptation, or the struggle between good and evil. The figure, if it represents a specific person, is not identifiable without further context.",
