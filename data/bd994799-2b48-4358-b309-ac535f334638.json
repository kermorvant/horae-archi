    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, seated on a green grassy area with scattered flowers. To the left, an angel in a red robe plays a harp-like instrument. To the right, another angel in a blue robe plays a viol. Behind them, a patterned tapestry hangs, with architectural elements suggesting a backdrop. The overall impression is one of a serene, devotional gathering, possibly a heavenly court or a symbolic representation of divine harmony.",
