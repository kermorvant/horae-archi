    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth. Below the cross, the Virgin Mary stands to the left, hands clasped in prayer and draped in a blue mantle. To the right stands Saint John the Evangelist, looking upwards with a gesture of lamentation. At the foot of the cross lies a skull and a bone, symbolizing Golgotha. The background features a landscape with rolling hills, trees, a body of water with a boat, and in the distance, a walled city with towers and spires, and a rocky outcrop on the left. The entire scene is framed by an arched border adorned with floral motifs.",
