    "scene_description_enriched": "Three young men are depicted standing on a green, undulating ground, surrounded by a decorative border of stylized foliage and flowers. The central figure, dressed in a vibrant red tunic, has his arms crossed. To his left, a figure in a blue tunic and red hose embraces the central figure. To the right, a third figure in a pinkish-red tunic covers his mouth with his hand, as if speaking or singing. The scene is framed by an elaborate, almost vine-like border with small, dark leaf-like motifs and occasional pink flowers. A large, brown, cone-shaped object hangs from the upper left of the border, possibly representing a stylized fruit or seed pod. The overall impression is one of youthful camaraderie or perhaps a scene from a narrative, though the specific context is not immediately clear from the visual elements alone.",
