    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man, likely a scholar or prophet, seated in a room filled with books. He wears a blue robe over a patterned pink garment and a dark cap. A halo surrounds his head, indicating sanctity. He is holding an open book and a small inkwell. To his left, a winged figure, possibly an angel, stands and gestures towards the seated man, also holding a book. The room features a window with arched panes looking out onto a landscape with trees and buildings, and another window with rectangular panes. Sunlight streams in from the left. Books are stacked on shelves and a circular lectern. The floor is tiled in a black and green checkerboard pattern. The entire scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
