    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic and fiery depiction of Hell. Several naked figures, seemingly souls in torment, are shown writhing in flames. They are surrounded by monstrous, demonic figures with grotesque features and horns, some of whom appear to be tormenting the souls. One prominent figure, a pale, fair-haired woman, is shown reaching down from a higher ledge into the pit of souls, possibly representing a plea for salvation or an act of intercession. The background is barren and rocky, with sparse, dead trees, suggesting a desolate and infernal landscape. The overall impression is one of suffering, damnation, and the struggle against demonic forces.",
