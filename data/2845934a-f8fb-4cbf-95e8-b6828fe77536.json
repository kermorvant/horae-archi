    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a brutal act of infanticide, likely representing the Massacre of the Innocents. A soldier in armor, wearing a distinctive pointed helmet, is shown stabbing a naked infant with a sword. To the left, a woman in a red dress covers her face in distress, while another infant lies on the ground nearby, seemingly already harmed. To the right, a group of men, including an elder figure in blue robes and a tall, elaborate headdress, and a man in full armor, observe the horrific event. In the background, a stylized landscape unfolds with rolling hills, trees, and a distant city with towers and buildings, suggesting a setting outside the city walls.",
