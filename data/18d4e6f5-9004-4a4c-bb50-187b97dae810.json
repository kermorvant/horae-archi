    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, possibly a king or prophet, is depicted in profile, facing left. He wears a crown and a richly draped garment. His right hand is raised, with fingers extended in a gesture of speech or blessing. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a decorative or symbolic space. To the right, a column is visible, part of an architectural frame. The overall style is that of a woodcut illustration, likely from a medieval manuscript or printed book.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image likely depicts a prophet or a king from the Old Testament, possibly in a scene of prophecy or pronouncement. The gesture of the raised hand is often associated with speaking or conveying divine message. Without further context, a specific biblical event cannot be definitively identified, but it aligns with devotional imagery of significant religious figures.",
