    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a haloed man with a long beard and wavy hair, dressed in a draped garment. He is shown from the chest up, with his left arm bent and his right arm extended, pointing. Beside him, to his right, is the head and shoulders of a bull. The background is plain, with small circles scattered around the halo. Below the figures, a band of text is visible, followed by an ornamental border with scrolling foliage. The man's halo and the presence of the bull strongly suggest a religious context, likely representing a saint or evangelist.",
