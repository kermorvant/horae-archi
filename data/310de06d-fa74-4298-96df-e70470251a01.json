    "scene_description_enriched": "A robed monk stands behind a crowned woman who is seated and reading from an open book placed on a lectern. The monk, wearing a blue habit and a tonsure, has his hand on the woman's shoulder. The woman, adorned with a crown, wears a pink and white garment and a dark patterned skirt. Behind them, a dark curtain hangs, and a patterned textile is visible. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs. The presence of the monk and the crowned woman suggests a devotional scene, possibly depicting a queen receiving spiritual guidance or instruction.",
