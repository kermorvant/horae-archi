    "scene_description_enriched": "This is a portrait of a man and a woman, likely a couple, depicted from the chest up. The man is on the left, with his hands clasped in prayer. He has a mustache and a beard, and wears a dark, patterned garment with a ruffled collar. A draped cloak is visible over his left shoulder. The woman is on the right, looking slightly away from the viewer. She has curly hair styled up and wears a ruffled collar and a dark, ornate dress. Both figures have faint halos, suggesting a devotional context or a representation of their piety. The background is dark and nondescript, focusing all attention on the figures.",
