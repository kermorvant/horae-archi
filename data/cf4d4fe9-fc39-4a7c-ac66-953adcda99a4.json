    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a stable. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and white veil, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a manger. Behind them, Saint Joseph, in a yellow robe and red cloak, also looks towards the child. A cow is visible in the background. The architecture suggests a humble dwelling with arched openings and a rough stone or brick construction. Light rays emanate from above, symbolizing divine intervention. Two figures are visible through an arched window on the left, observing the scene.",
