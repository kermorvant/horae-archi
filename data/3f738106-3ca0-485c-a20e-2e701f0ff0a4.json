    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned figure, likely a bishop or saint, stands holding a book open and a processional cross. The figure wears elaborate vestments, including a blue tunic, a red cloak lined with green, and a jeweled crown. Behind the crowned figure, a tonsured monk in a white habit and green scarf holds a staff topped with a cross. To the left, a white sarcophagus or tomb is visible, draped with a white cloth and adorned with green and gold patterns. To the right, a richly decorated chair or throne with golden accents stands against a blue background with gold floral motifs. In the background, shelves hold several books. The scene appears to be set within an interior space, possibly a chapel or a study, indicated by the architectural elements and furnishings.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a saintly bishop or a figure of authority in the church, possibly engaged in prayer or study, as suggested by the open book and the presence of a tomb. The cross indicates religious authority. The monk's presence might suggest a monastic setting or a follower.",
