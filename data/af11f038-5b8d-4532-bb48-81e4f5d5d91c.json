    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe and white veil, cradles the Christ Child in her arms. Before them, one of the Magi kneels in adoration, his hand extended. Another Magus, wearing a pink hat and blue robe, holds a golden chalice and points upwards, seemingly guided by the star of Bethlehem, which radiates golden light from the upper right. A third Magus, with dark skin and a golden crown, also looks upwards, holding a golden vessel. In the background, a rustic stable structure with a thatched roof is visible. Beyond this, a walled city with towers and spires is depicted, with a procession of figures and horses approaching from the right. The overall setting is a landscape with rolling hills and trees.",
