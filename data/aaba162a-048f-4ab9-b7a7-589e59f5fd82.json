    "scene_description_enriched": "The upper register depicts a bearded figure, likely God the Father, wearing a crown and holding a globe in his left hand and the Ten Commandments in his right. He is seated on a throne or cloud-like structure from which rays emanate downwards. Below him, a haloed figure, presumably Christ, is depicted with a beard and long hair, wearing a robe and a jeweled collar. He raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing and holds a cross in his left hand. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting a decorative canopy or microarchitecture, with pointed arches and ornamental tracery. The overall composition suggests a divine or celestial representation.",
