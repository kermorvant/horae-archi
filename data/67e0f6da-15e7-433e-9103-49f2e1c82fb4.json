    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a pilgrim or saint, stands holding a book in his left hand and a staff in his right. He wears a hat adorned with a shell motif, a cloak, and a tunic. The background depicts a starry sky and a stylized landscape with trees and rocky formations. An arched architectural element frames the upper portion of the scene. The shell on his hat and his pilgrim's staff suggest he may be Saint James the Greater, a popular pilgrimage destination.",
