    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a stable-like structure, suggested by the wooden beams overhead and the rough stone wall in the background. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, cradles the Christ Child. One of the Magi, kneeling, offers a golden vessel. Another Magus stands behind him, holding a similar offering and gesturing, while a third Magus, wearing a turban, stands to the left, also holding a golden vessel. The figures are richly dressed, and the setting, while suggesting a humble stable, is adorned with decorative elements.",
