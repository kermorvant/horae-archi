    "scene_description_enriched": "A man with a red headband, wearing a pink tunic over blue leggings and dark shoes, stands in a landscape. He holds a small object in his right hand and looks towards the viewer. To his left, a large crayfish is depicted. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded architectural archway with decorative elements and inscriptions. The background features a rocky outcrop and distant blue mountains under a pale sky with birds. The inscription above the arch reads 'IESVIS LESIGNE'. This imagery likely represents a zodiacal sign or a symbolic representation related to the month of June, often associated with the constellation Cancer (the crab/crayfish) and possibly a figure associated with that period.",
