    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a formal indoor setting, likely a royal or noble chamber, where an elder figure, seated on an ornate chair, receives a small document from a younger man. The seated figure, distinguished by a long white beard and a rich, patterned robe, wears a distinctive headdress. He is attended by several other men, some standing behind him, and one kneeling figure in the foreground. The background reveals a rich blue tapestry with gold patterns, and a glimpse of an outdoor landscape with a castle or city in the distance. The interaction suggests a moment of presentation or petition.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a moment of petition or the presentation of a decree or message, possibly within a historical or biblical narrative. The formality of the figures and the setting suggest an event of importance, such as a king receiving a petition from a subject, or a scene from the Old Testament involving royalty and advisors.",
