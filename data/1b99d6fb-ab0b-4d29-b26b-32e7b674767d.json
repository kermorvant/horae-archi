    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in what appears to be an interior setting, suggested by a richly patterned tapestry or wall hanging behind them. In the foreground, a woman in a purple robe and white headdress kneels, holding a lamb. To her right, a man in a blue tunic and red cap holds another lamb aloft, seemingly presenting it. To the left, another man in an orange robe looks on. The figures are engaged in an action that, given the presence of lambs and the devotional context of Books of Hours, likely represents a sacrifice or offering, possibly related to the Presentation of Christ in the Temple where a lamb was offered.",
