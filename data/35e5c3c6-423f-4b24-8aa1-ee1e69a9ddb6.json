    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a brutal act of violence in an outdoor setting. Two armored soldiers are shown. One soldier, on the left, is in the process of swinging a curved sword, while a woman in a blue gown and white veil attempts to intervene by grabbing his arm. This soldier is holding a naked infant by its arm, with blood visible on the child. To the right, another armored soldier stands holding a spear, from which a second naked infant is suspended by its leg, also showing signs of injury and blood. The background features rolling hills, a sparse tree, and a blue sky with some stylized clouds and stars. The overall impression is one of horror and desperation.",
