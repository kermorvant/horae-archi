    "scene_description_enriched": "The image is a portrait of a man, likely a clergyman, depicted from the chest up. He wears a red cap and a red garment over a white collar. His hair is dark and curly, falling to his shoulders, and he has a mustache and a goatee. A decorative brooch is visible at the neck of his garment. The background is a muted, textured oval, with partial text visible in a blue band around the edge. The overall impression is of a formal portrait, possibly within an illuminated manuscript or as a standalone artwork.",
