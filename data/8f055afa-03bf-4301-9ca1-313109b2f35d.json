The Virgin Mary, with golden hair and wearing a blue mantle over an orange tunic, sits holding the Christ Child, who is naked. Three Magi approach, offering gifts. The first Magus, kneeling, wears a red cloak over a blue garment and presents a golden chalice. The second Magus, standing, wears a green robe and a blue hat, holding a similar chalice. The third Magus, also standing, is dressed in a blue robe and a red headdress, carrying a golden vessel. Behind them, a simple thatched structure with wooden supports is visible, suggesting a humble dwelling. The background shows a landscape with trees and a distant city, under a sky with rays of light emanating from the upper left. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
