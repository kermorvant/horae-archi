    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely an apostle or saint, stands holding a processional cross topped with a crucifix and a blue book. He is draped in a flowing purple mantle over a green tunic. The background suggests an architectural interior with columns and decorative panels, opening to a view of a distant city through a large window. The scene is rendered with rich colors and detailed drapery, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
