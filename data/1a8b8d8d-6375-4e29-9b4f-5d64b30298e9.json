    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a group of three women, their faces rendered in profile or three-quarter view. They are all wearing veils that cover their heads and drape over their shoulders. The central figure is looking forward with a somber expression, while the figure to her right gazes upwards. The figures are dressed in long, flowing robes. The woman on the right has a string of beads visible on her garment. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style, with bold outlines and minimal detail, suggesting a devotional or narrative context.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The depiction of women in veils, particularly with one gazing upwards, could suggest a scene of prayer, mourning, or contemplation. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific biblical or devotional event is difficult to ascertain. However, the presence of multiple women in a group often signifies a communal religious experience or a narrative involving female figures in sacred history.",
