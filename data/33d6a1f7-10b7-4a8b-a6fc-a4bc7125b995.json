He is dressed in a yellow tunic and a pink and white robe, with a green halo and a red cap. To his left, a winged ox, the symbol of Saint Luke, lies on a green ground, with a scroll bearing an inscription. Behind Saint Luke, a rich blue curtain with gold patterns is drawn, suggesting an indoor setting. The floor is green, and several books are scattered around, including one open on the floor. A small, ornate tower-like structure with a figure on top is visible behind the lectern.",
