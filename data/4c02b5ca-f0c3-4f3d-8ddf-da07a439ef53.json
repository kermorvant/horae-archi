    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in a landscape setting. On the left, a woman in a red and blue robe with a blue head covering points towards a man kneeling on the right. Between them stands another figure, also hooded in a golden-brown robe. The kneeling man, with a white beard and loincloth, has his hands clasped in prayer and appears to be receiving divine light or inspiration, indicated by rays emanating from above and a faint glow around him. In the background, a fortified city with towers and spires is visible, set against a hilly landscape under a blue sky. The ground is depicted as tilled earth.",
