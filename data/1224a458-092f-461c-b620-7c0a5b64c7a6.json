    "scene_description_enriched": "A man kneels in prayer on a grassy hill, with flames erupting around him and a divine figure in a golden halo above. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills and trees unfolds. To the right, a crowd of people, some wearing crowns and elaborate robes, stand before several conical tents adorned with gold. The scene depicts a moment of divine intervention or judgment, possibly related to a biblical narrative where a figure is tested or judged by God, with onlookers observing.",
