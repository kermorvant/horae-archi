Behind Saint Mark, a vaulted architectural space is visible, with columns and arched windows. The background suggests an interior setting with a glimpse of a landscape through an opening on the left. The overall scene represents the evangelist Saint Mark in the act of writing his Gospel, accompanied by his symbolic animal.",
