    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three men in medieval attire, standing in what appears to be an outdoor setting with foliage above. The man on the left wears a cap and a tunic, holding a small object. The central figure is partially obscured, wearing a hood. The man on the right, also in a tunic and hose, is facing the viewer's left and appears to be interacting with the man on the left. In the foreground, two animals resembling pigs or boars are visible, one lying down and the other standing. The overall impression is of a pastoral or possibly a hunting scene, suggested by the presence of the animals and the rustic clothing of the figures. The text above the image, 'is illius: et milit', hints at a narrative context, possibly related to military service or a specific individual's life.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene's interpretation is uncertain without further context. The presence of the animals and the men's attire could suggest a scene from the life of a saint associated with animals, a biblical narrative involving hunting or agriculture, or a secular scene of daily life. The Latin text 'is illius: et milit' translates to 'of him: and soldier' or 'of him: and fought', which could imply a narrative about a soldier or a military campaign, potentially linking the scene to a historical or biographical account.",
