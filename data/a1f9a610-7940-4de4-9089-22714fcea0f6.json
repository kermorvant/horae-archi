    "scene_description_enriched": "A man identified as David, wearing a blue and gold patterned robe and a fur-trimmed mantle, rides a donkey. He looks upwards with his mouth open. To the right, a figure in a black habit and white wimple holds a banner with the inscription \"CONFI PLARIO\" and a green apple. This figure stands in front of a building with a large window revealing an interior with a bed and a green vase. The scene is framed by architectural elements, including columns and crenellated walls, with glimpses of other buildings and a green landscape in the background.",
