    "scene_description_enriched": "A nude child with blond hair is depicted watering a patch of grass with a blue watering can. The child is leaning forward, pouring water from the can onto the ground. In the background, a river or body of water is visible, with steps leading down to it. Beyond the water, a city skyline with prominent towers and buildings is rendered in muted colors. The scene is framed by an arched border, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents the astrological sign of Aquarius, which is often depicted as a youth pouring water. In the context of a Book of Hours, such zodiacal representations were common and could be used to mark the passage of time or as allegorical elements.",
