    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure with long blonde hair and a golden halo is depicted. She wears a pink robe with gold trim and holds a golden object, possibly a crown or a reliquary, in her left hand. Her right hand grips a sword, which rests horizontally across her body. The background is a vibrant green with swirling gold decorative motifs. The figure's gaze is directed downwards and to the left, with a somber expression. This imagery is consistent with depictions of female martyrs, often identified by their instruments of martyrdom.",
