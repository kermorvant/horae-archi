    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, some with beards and wearing robes and head coverings, are depicted in an outdoor setting. The foreground shows several figures in conversation, with one older man in a blue and gold robe gesturing outwards. Behind them, a lush green landscape stretches into the distance, dotted with trees and a few distant buildings. The sky above is a vibrant blue with scattered golden clouds. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded archway, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a biblical narrative involving disciples or apostles, possibly during a journey or a moment of teaching. The presence of multiple male figures in conversation and the outdoor setting are common in depictions of events from the Gospels or the Acts of the Apostles.",
