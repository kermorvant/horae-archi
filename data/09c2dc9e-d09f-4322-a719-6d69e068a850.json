    "scene_description_enriched": "In a verdant landscape, two men are engaged in agricultural labor. The foreground features a man with a beard, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, an orange tunic, blue trousers, and white stockings, actively mowing grass with a scythe. To his right, another man, dressed in a red vest over a white shirt and dark trousers, sits resting against a tree, drinking from a wooden cup. In the background, a body of water flows past lush trees, and a complex of stone buildings, including a tower with a conical roof, is visible. The scene likely depicts a pastoral setting, possibly illustrating a month of the year or a biblical parable related to labor and rest.",
