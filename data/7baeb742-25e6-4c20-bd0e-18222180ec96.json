    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting that suggests an interior space. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, identifiable by his wings and halo, kneels and gestures towards the Virgin Mary. He wears an ornate golden robe over a white tunic and holds a golden staff. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer and a halo around her head. She wears a blue robe over a grey garment. Between them is an open book on a stand, and above them, the Holy Spirit is represented as a dove descending with rays of light. The background features a red canopy and dark wooden panels, suggesting a domestic or private chamber. The overall scene is framed by an arched architectural element with gold ornamentation.",
