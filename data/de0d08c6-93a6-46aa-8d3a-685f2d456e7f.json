    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in prayer within a domestic setting. On the left, a woman in a black headdress and dark robes, with a fur-lined cloak, clasps her hands in prayer. Before her, a large, ornate red scroll unfurls, inscribed with Latin text. To the right, a man kneels before a lectern, his hands pressed together in prayer, reading from an open book. He wears a yellow tunic with blue sleeves. Behind him, a richly decorated bed with red bedding and green drapery is visible. Above the figures, a radiant vision appears: a figure, likely a divine messenger or Christ, descends from a golden halo surrounded by rays of light, also accompanied by a blue scroll with Latin inscription. The overall impression is one of devout contemplation and spiritual visitation within a private chamber.",
