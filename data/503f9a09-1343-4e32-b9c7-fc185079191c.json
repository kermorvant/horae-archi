    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of souls in purgatory, surrounded by flames. A central figure, appearing emaciated and skeletal, raises their hands in supplication. Above, an angel with golden wings and a crown descends, holding a scroll with the inscription \"Miseremini mei, miseremini mei\" (Have mercy on me, have mercy on me). The background is a deep blue, suggesting a celestial or otherworldly setting. The flames are depicted in vibrant reds and oranges, engulfing the figures from the waist down.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene represents the souls in Purgatory pleading for mercy. The inscription on the scroll is a direct plea for intercession, likely from the living, to alleviate their suffering and hasten their passage to heaven. The presence of the angel signifies divine intervention and the hope for salvation.",
