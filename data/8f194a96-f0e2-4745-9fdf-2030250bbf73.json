    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. A bishop, identified by his mitre, stands to the left, holding the infant Christ who is seated on a draped table. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is to the right of the child, her hands clasped in prayer. Behind the bishop is an older man with a beard, also with hands clasped. To the far left, a figure in a blue cap and red robe stands, and to the far right, a woman in a blue headdress and pink robe holds a basket. The figures are within an architectural setting suggested by a draped canopy and patterned walls. The overall scene is rendered with gold accents on the halos, garments, and architectural details.",
