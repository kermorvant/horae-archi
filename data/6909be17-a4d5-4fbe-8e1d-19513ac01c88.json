    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, centrally positioned and adorned with a golden halo, her hands clasped in prayer. She wears a blue mantle over a white veil. To her left, a bearded man in a red robe and cowl plays a harp. To her right, another figure, possibly a monk, kneels in a golden robe and blue tunic, also playing a harp. In front of the Virgin Mary lies an open book. The figures are set against a backdrop of a green-framed doorway or niche, with brick-like walls on either side. The floor is tiled.",
