    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, kneels before the Christ Child, who lies on the ground radiating divine light. Joseph, an elderly figure with a white beard, stands to the right, leaning on a staff and shielding his eyes, perhaps in awe or contemplation. Behind them, a cow and an ox are visible. The stable itself is constructed of rough wooden planks and has a thatched roof. In the background, a woven fence separates the stable area from a green hillside dotted with trees. Beyond the hill, a walled city with towers and spires is depicted under a starry blue sky. A figure in a brown robe stands near the fence, looking towards the stable.",
