    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an interior space, likely a chapel or sacristy, where three figures are present. On the left, a golden reliquary, adorned with architectural details and figures, rests on a draped altar. A candle in a candlestick illuminates the reliquary. To the right of the altar, a monk in a black habit stands with hands clasped, observing the scene. In the foreground, a man kneels with his hands clasped in prayer, his head tilted upwards. He is dressed in a red tunic and white undergarment, with yellow leg wrappings. Beside him, another man, leaning on two crutches, also clasps his hands in prayer. He wears a purple tunic and red leggings, and his legs appear bandaged. The background features a wall with arched windows, suggesting an ecclesiastical setting. The overall scene conveys a devotional act of prayer and supplication, possibly seeking healing or intercession.",
