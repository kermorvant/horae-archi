    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two female figures against a decorative, patterned background. On the right, a haloed woman, likely a saint, stands wearing a white wimple, a blue robe, and a pink and gold mantle. She holds a red book in her left arm and a golden vessel, possibly an alabastron, in her right hand. A scroll unfurls from the left, bearing Latin text. To the left, a younger woman kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, dressed in a red gown and an elaborate headdress. The background is a tessellated pattern of red, blue, and gold squares, with smaller circular motifs. The lower portion of the image shows a green grassy ground. The overall impression is devotional, possibly representing a saint in conversation with a supplicant.",
