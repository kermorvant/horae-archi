    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, many in monastic robes, are gathered outdoors. In the foreground, several individuals are actively engaged in lowering a coffin into a grave. One figure reads from an open book, possibly a priest or monk leading a funeral rite. Others hold processional crosses and staffs. Behind them, a walled structure with battlements and an arched doorway suggests a fortified building or a section of a city wall. The scene depicts a funeral procession and burial, likely a religious ceremony.",
