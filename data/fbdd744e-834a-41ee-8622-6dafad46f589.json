    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and halo, stands on the left, holding a golden disc in his right hand. He is richly attired in a pink cope over a green chasuble, with ornate gold trim. Behind him is a patterned tapestry of blue and gold. To the right, a pink architectural structure rises, featuring arched windows and a balcony. Several figures, including a man in a blue robe with a beard and two women, peer out from an opening in the building. The scene appears to depict a religious or civic event involving the bishop and the inhabitants of the building.",
