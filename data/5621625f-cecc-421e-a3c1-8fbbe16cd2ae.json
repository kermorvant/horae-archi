    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue and with a halo, is seated with her hands crossed over her chest, looking downwards at an open book placed on a dark lectern. Behind her is a red curtain with gold ornamentation. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, adorned in a red robe and with large blue wings, kneels and gestures towards Mary. Above Gabriel, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends. The figures are framed by an arched architectural structure with gold detailing, suggesting an interior space, possibly a room or a chapel.",
