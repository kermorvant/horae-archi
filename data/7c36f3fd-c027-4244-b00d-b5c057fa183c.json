    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, seated and holding the Christ Child, is riding on a donkey. Joseph, wearing a hat and cloak, walks alongside the donkey, holding its reins and looking towards the viewer. In the background, architectural elements suggest a town or city, with buildings and a tower visible under an arched frame. The overall composition suggests a narrative of travel and perhaps a journey to Bethlehem.",
