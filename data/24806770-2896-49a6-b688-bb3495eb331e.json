    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, stands in profile, looking down. He wears a blue cope with gold trim over a red undergarment and white alb. His right hand, gloved in white, is extended. To the right, two nude figures, possibly children, are depicted in a wooden tub filled with water. The background is a patterned textile, and the foreground is a green grassy area with sparse yellow vegetation. This scene likely depicts Saint Nicholas of Myra performing a miracle, possibly related to saving children or a baptismal rite, given his association with children and his episcopal status.",
