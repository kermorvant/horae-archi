    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a gathering of figures, predominantly angels, within an architectural setting that suggests a celestial or heavenly realm. Several winged figures, some carrying infants, are interspersed among stylized buildings with pointed roofs and arched openings. In the foreground, a seated woman, possibly the Virgin Mary, rests her head on her hand, appearing contemplative. The background is filled with a starry sky, reinforcing the otherworldly atmosphere. The overall impression is one of divine presence and perhaps a moment of quiet reflection or anticipation.",
