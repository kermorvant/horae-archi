    "scene_description_enriched": "A hunter, dressed in a red tunic and blue hose, aims a crossbow at a rabbit in a wooded landscape. A dog accompanies the hunter, sniffing the ground. Above the scene, within a circular medallion, is an image of a ram, possibly representing the zodiac sign Aries. The entire scene is framed by decorative architectural elements, including columns and a gilded frieze, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
