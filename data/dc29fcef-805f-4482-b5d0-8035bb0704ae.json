    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man in a red robe hanging from a tree by a rope, his eyes wide open and mouth agape in apparent distress. Below him, on the grassy ground, lies a discarded blue garment. In the background, a fortified castle with multiple towers is situated on a hill, accessed by a winding path and stairs. The landscape is dotted with trees and bushes under a clear blue sky. This imagery likely represents the suicide of Judas Iscariot, a biblical event where he hanged himself after betraying Jesus.",
