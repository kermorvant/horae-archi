    "scene_description_enriched": "The central figure, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted in prayer, enveloped in a luminous, oval mandorla. She wears a dark habit and a veil, with her hands clasped in devotion. Surrounding her, arranged in concentric arcs, are numerous heads of individuals, some appearing as children and others as adults, all looking towards the central figure with expressions of awe or supplication. The background is dark and abstract, suggesting a celestial or spiritual setting, with stylized leaf-like forms framing the figures.",
