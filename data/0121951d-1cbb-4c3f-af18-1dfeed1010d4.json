    "scene_description_enriched": "A cardinal kneels in prayer before an altar, his hands clasped around a red book. He wears a red cape over a white robe, and a red cardinal's hat hangs above him. To the right, a man in military attire aims a musket, firing a shot that appears to be directed towards the cardinal. The scene is set within an interior space with architectural elements such as columns and arches, suggesting a church or chapel. The altar is adorned with a crucifix and candles. In the background, an arcade with balustrades and windows is visible, hinting at a larger architectural complex.",
