    "scene_description_enriched": "The upper register depicts a dramatic scene of violence and divine intervention. A soldier in golden armor holds a sword aloft, seemingly about to strike a woman dressed in red who cradles a child. Another woman in blue, with a blue veil, looks on with distress. Above them, a child in a red garment is being lifted into the air, possibly by divine force, with outstretched arms. The background shows a wooded landscape and a fortified structure. The lower register presents a peaceful scene of the Flight into Egypt, with the Virgin Mary riding a donkey, holding the Christ Child, and accompanied by Saint Joseph walking beside them. They are in a pastoral landscape with rolling hills and trees. The entire composition is framed by ornate architectural elements, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The upper scene likely depicts the Massacre of the Innocents, with the child being miraculously saved. The lower scene is the Flight into Egypt, a common theme in Books of Hours. Together, these scenes likely illustrate a narrative related to the early life of Christ and the persecution faced by his family.",
