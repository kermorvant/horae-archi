    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a profile view of a man wearing a distinctive hat and a richly decorated garment. He has a beard and is adorned with a collar of three circular elements. His right hand is raised, with fingers extended in a gesture of speech or blessing, while his left hand is lowered. He holds a scepter or staff in his right hand, topped with a circular, floral-like ornament. The figure is framed by a decorative border, suggesting it is part of a larger composition, possibly a playing card or an initial letter in a manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This figure, with his regal attire and scepter, is likely a representation of a king, possibly from the Old Testament or a secular ruler depicted in a devotional context. The gesture of his raised hand could signify authority, prophecy, or benediction. Without further context, a specific biblical or devotional scene cannot be definitively identified.",
