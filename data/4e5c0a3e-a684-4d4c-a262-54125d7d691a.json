    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and white veil, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, gazing at the Christ Child lying on a red, star-patterned blanket. The Christ Child is depicted with a radiant halo. To the left, a woman in a blue tunic and skirt pours water from a jug into a wooden tub, presumably for bathing the infant. Behind them, a grey donkey and a brown ox are visible, with the ox looking towards the child. In the upper part of the scene, a representation of God the Father, with a white beard and halo, is shown in a blue and red celestial sphere, with golden rays descending. The background is a rocky, mountainous landscape. The entire scene is framed by an arched border decorated with colorful foliage.",
