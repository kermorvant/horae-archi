    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed male figures stand in an outdoor landscape. The figure on the left, dressed in a blue robe over a red tunic, holds a large key. He gestures with his right hand. The figure on the right, wearing a golden robe patterned with red motifs over a blue tunic, leans on a sword. The background depicts rolling green hills, a body of water, and distant buildings. A single tree stands between the two figures. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
