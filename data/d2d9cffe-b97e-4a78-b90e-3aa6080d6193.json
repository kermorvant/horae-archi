    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed female figure, likely a saint, kneels with hands clasped in prayer, holding a cross. To her left, a lion-like creature with a human-like face gnaws on a scroll or cloth. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling a pointed arch with decorative tracery, and the background is filled with stippling suggesting a starry or textured sky. The figure's long, flowing hair and simple robe indicate a devotional context. The presence of the lion is a common attribute for certain saints, particularly those who were persecuted or faced trials.",
