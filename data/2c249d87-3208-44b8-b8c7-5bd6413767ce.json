    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a brutal act of violence set within a town square. A woman in a red gown kneels, cradling an infant. To her right, a man in a blue tunic and hat raises a sword, poised to strike. Another man, dressed in armor and green leggings, stands to the left, holding a knife and appearing to threaten the woman. To the right of the sword-wielding man, another figure holds a second infant. In the background, buildings with tiled roofs and a church tower suggest an urban setting. The sky is populated with birds and clouds. This scene is an illustration of the Massacre of the Innocents, a biblical event where King Herod ordered the killing of all male infants in Bethlehem in an attempt to kill the newborn Jesus.",
