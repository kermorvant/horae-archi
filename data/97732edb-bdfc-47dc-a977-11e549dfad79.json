    "scene_description_enriched": "This image is a decorative border from a medieval manuscript, featuring a vertical strip filled with various motifs. At the top, a figure with a distinctive headdress and beard is depicted, possibly a saint or prophet. Below this, a stylized serpent or dragon-like creature coils, its body rendered with hatching. Further down, there are foliate scrolls and decorative elements. Towards the bottom, another figure is visible, with hands raised in prayer or supplication, and a stylized sunburst behind their head. The overall impression is one of intricate, symbolic ornamentation rather than a narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This is a decorative border, likely intended to frame text or an image within a Book of Hours or similar devotional text. The motifs, such as the bearded figure and the serpent, could allude to biblical figures or concepts, or simply serve as symbolic ornamentation common in medieval art. The figure with raised hands might represent a supplicant or a saint in prayer.",
