Several other women, also in headdresses and gowns, are visible behind her. Two of the women in the center and right have their hands clasped in prayer. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style with bold outlines and hatching to suggest drapery and form. No architectural elements or specific setting are depicted, suggesting a focus on the figures and their devotional posture.",
