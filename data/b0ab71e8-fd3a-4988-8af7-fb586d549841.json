    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, stands in a grassy area. They are dressed in a light blue robe adorned with gold stars and a flowing red mantle. The figure holds a golden chalice containing a green sprig. Behind them, a decorative gold tapestry with a floral pattern is visible, flanked by green columns. To the left and right, glimpses of an outdoor landscape are seen through openings: on the left, a stone structure and a tree are depicted against a blue sky and water; on the right, a distant cityscape is visible under a blue sky. The figure's gesture and the chalice suggest a devotional context, possibly representing a saint associated with the Eucharist or martyrdom.",
