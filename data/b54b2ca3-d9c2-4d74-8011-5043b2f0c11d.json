    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the body of Jesus laid out on a white shroud atop a sarcophagus. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, cradles Christ's head, while other mourners, including women in white veils and men in robes, surround the body with expressions of grief. A woman in a golden robe kneels at the foot of the sarcophagus, tending to Christ's wounds. In the background, a stylized landscape unfolds with a body of water, a castle with spires, rolling hills, and three crosses on Golgotha, two of which bear figures. The scene is framed by ornate architectural elements, suggesting a devotional context.",
