    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle with gold trim, is seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child. Joseph, in a red tunic and blue cap, walks beside the donkey, guiding it. They are traveling through a rocky, mountainous landscape with a distant city visible on a hill. The scene is framed by an ornate, gilded arch, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
