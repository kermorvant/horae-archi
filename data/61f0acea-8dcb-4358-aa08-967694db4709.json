    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with blue wings and a halo descends from a blue sky, holding a banner that reads 'Gloria in excelsis Deo'. Rays of golden light emanate from the angel towards a walled city in the background. In the foreground, three shepherds and a woman are depicted in a grassy landscape with sheep. One shepherd, wearing a blue hood and tunic, holds a crook and appears to be playing a pipe. Another shepherd, in a brown and gold striped tunic, shields his eyes and looks upwards. A woman in a red dress sits and holds a rosary. A dog lies at the feet of the shepherds. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
