He holds a golden orb with a cross on top. To the left is Christ, shown as a young man with a beard, wearing a red cloak draped over his bare torso, revealing wounds on his chest and hand. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, flies downwards. The figures are seated on a golden platform, framed by an arched architectural element that opens to a sky filled with clouds and hints of a landscape below. The overall composition is set within a decorative border with floral motifs.",
