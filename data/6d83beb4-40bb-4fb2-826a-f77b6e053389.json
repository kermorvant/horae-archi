    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and white veil, is seated on a donkey, cradling the Christ Child. Joseph, with a red tunic and blue cloak, walks beside the donkey, carrying a staff. In the background, a rural landscape unfolds with a thatched-roof building, trees, and rolling hills. A broken stone archway is visible, and atop a rocky mound, a golden finial with a figure stands prominently. The overall impression is one of travel and humble pilgrimage.",
