    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic gathering of figures in a dark, cavernous space, possibly representing hell or a place of torment. Several nude or partially clothed figures, some with pale skin and others with reddish tones, are intertwined and appear to be suffering. One figure in the foreground is reaching down, while another is recoiling. In the background, more figures are visible, some with distorted features. The overall impression is one of distress and anguish. The scene is framed by a decorative border on the left, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
