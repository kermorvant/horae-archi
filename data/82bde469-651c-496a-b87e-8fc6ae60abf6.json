    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross in the center. He is wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth. To the left, the Virgin Mary is kneeling, dressed in a blue mantle, with her hands clasped in prayer. To the right, a figure in a red robe, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also kneels with hands clasped. The background features a hilly landscape with some trees and a distant city with towers and walls. The sky is a light blue with some horizontal lines suggesting clouds or distant elements. A golden border frames the entire scene.",
