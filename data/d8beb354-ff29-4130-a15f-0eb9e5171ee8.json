    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation. On the left, an angel with feathered wings, dressed in red and green robes, gestures towards a dove descending from above. The angel stands against a backdrop of ornate, swirling patterns in blue and gold. To the right, within an architectural structure featuring an arched opening and a stepped base, the Virgin Mary is depicted. She wears a blue robe and a veil, with a golden halo surrounding her head. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, is shown in flight between the angel and Mary. The architectural element suggests a niche or a small sanctuary.",
