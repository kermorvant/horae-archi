    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a martyrdom, likely Saint Agnes, kneeling in prayer before a pyre. She is partially draped in a white cloth. Two men are actively tending the fire with long poles, one on the right wearing a blue tunic and a crown-like headdress, and another on the left in a white tunic and cap. Behind the pyre, a group of figures in elaborate robes observe the scene, one holding a staff topped with a cross. In the background, a fortified city with towers and walls is visible under a blue sky, surrounded by greenery and a body of water.",
