    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a beard, wearing a blue cap, a green tunic, and a red cloak adorned with gold embellishments, embracing a woman. The woman, dressed in a blue gown and a white head covering, appears to be leaning into the embrace. They stand before an arched entryway of a golden, fortified building with crenellated battlements and small, rectangular windows. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills, trees, and another fortified structure with a conical roof is visible under a blue sky. The overall impression is one of a tender or perhaps clandestine meeting within a grand architectural setting.",
