    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable structure, characterized by wooden beams and a thatched roof. Inside, a white horse and a brown ox are visible, along with the Christ Child lying in a manger. To the right, the Virgin Mary kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, her blue mantle adorned with gold trim. Beside her, a bearded man, likely Saint Joseph, also kneels in prayer. The background shows a rolling landscape with trees and a distant town with buildings and a castle, under a sky illuminated by divine rays emanating from a sun-like symbol. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
