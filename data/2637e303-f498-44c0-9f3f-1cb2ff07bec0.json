    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a golden, ornate font or pedestal. Above them, a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from a banner inscribed with \"VENI SAC TE SPIRITVS S.\". Many of the figures are shown with halos, indicating their sanctity, and some are playing musical instruments, possibly trumpets or horns. The figures are dressed in medieval attire, with some kneeling and others standing, all looking upwards towards the dove. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a green, grassy ground and a blue sky with stylized foliage. This scene represents the Pentecost, the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles.",
