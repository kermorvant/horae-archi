    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts an angel with large wings, seated and looking downwards, gesturing with its left hand towards a group of three women. The women are dressed in dark robes and wear halos, suggesting they are important figures, possibly saints or holy women. One woman, in the center, holds a cylindrical object topped with a conical lid. Below this upper scene, a circular architectural element encloses two figures in combat. One figure, clad in mail armor and a helmet, is seated and appears to be overpowering another figure who is lying on the ground. The overall composition suggests a narrative with both celestial and earthly elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Annunciation, with the angel Gabriel appearing to the Virgin Mary, accompanied by other holy women. The lower scene, depicting a struggle, could symbolize the triumph of good over evil, or a specific biblical event related to overcoming adversaries, possibly linked to the broader narrative of salvation.",
