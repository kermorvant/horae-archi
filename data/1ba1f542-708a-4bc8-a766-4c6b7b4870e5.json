    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely Saint Peter, standing on a raised platform of stacked books or cushions. He is dressed in a red tunic and a blue mantle, with a golden halo around his head. His eyes are closed, and his hands are clasped in prayer or contemplation. He is surrounded by a group of men, some wearing elaborate hats and robes, who appear to be listening to him or observing him. The background is a rich blue tapestry with floral motifs. The overall impression is one of a religious or spiritual gathering, possibly a sermon or a moment of divine inspiration.",
