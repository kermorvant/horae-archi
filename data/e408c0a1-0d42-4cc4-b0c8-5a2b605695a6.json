    "scene_description_enriched": "A tonsured cleric, wearing a chasuble and stole, kneels and drinks from a chalice, his head tilted back in an act of devotion. To his left, another figure, possibly a monk, looks on. In the background, behind a railing, stand three women, one of whom appears to be holding a book. The scene is set within an architectural space, suggested by columns and a wall on the left, and a draped table with a lamp on the right. The overall impression is one of a religious ritual or devotional practice.",
