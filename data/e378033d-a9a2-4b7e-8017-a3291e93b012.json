On the left, a person with long, grey hair and a halo, dressed in a blue robe, points with their right index finger towards a scroll or manuscript laid out before them. This figure appears to be dictating or instructing. On the right, a younger figure with blonde hair, also with a halo, wears a yellow robe and holds open a book, appearing to be writing or transcribing. The background is a flat, reddish-pink color with some subtle decorative elements. The overall impression is one of scholarly or spiritual instruction and recording.",
