    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Sacrifice of Isaac, with Abraham, guided by an angel, about to sacrifice his son. Abraham, a bearded man in a blue tunic and pink cloak, holds a sword raised to strike Isaac, who is kneeling on a stone altar. An angel with colorful wings hovers above, placing a hand on Abraham's arm to stay his hand. Isaac is bound and positioned on a pyre of wood. To the right, smoke rises from a golden censer with flames, suggesting a ritualistic element. In the background, a lush green landscape unfolds with trees and rocky outcrops. Further in the distance, a city with domed buildings is visible. In the lower part of the scene, a ram is caught in the branches of a tree, a common motif in this narrative. Below the altar, two figures are seated near a donkey, possibly travelers or onlookers.",
