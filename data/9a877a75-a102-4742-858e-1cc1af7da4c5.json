    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, kneels before a table covered with a white cloth, upon which the Christ Child lies. Joseph, holding a basket of doves, stands to her left. To the right, a bishop, wearing a mitre and ornate vestments, holds the Christ Child. A young acolyte stands behind them, holding an open book. The figures are set within an architectural framework featuring elaborate golden columns and arches, suggesting a sacred space. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern. The overall scene is rendered with rich colors and intricate details, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
