    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit, also known as Pentecost. In the center, the Virgin Mary is seated, holding an open book, surrounded by a group of figures, some of whom are looking upwards with raised hands in prayer or awe. Above them, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a radiant light, with rays of light extending downwards. The figures are gathered within an architectural setting characterized by ornate, Gothic-style tracery and columns, suggesting a sacred or important interior space. The overall atmosphere is one of spiritual reception and divine inspiration.",
