    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a long white beard, wearing a golden robe and a pink mantle, looking upwards towards a vision of Christ. Christ, depicted in a red robe and with a halo, holds a book and is surrounded by a blue mandorla adorned with stars. In front of the bearded man is a table covered with a white cloth, upon which rests a golden chalice. Behind the bearded man, two other figures are visible, one in a blue robe and another in a tan robe, also looking towards the vision. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of red, blue, and gold squares. The scene appears to be set within an interior space, possibly a chapel or a room where a religious vision is occurring.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a divine vision, possibly of Christ, experienced by a holy figure, perhaps a prophet or a saint. The chalice on the table could symbolize the Eucharist or a sacrificial offering. The presence of onlookers suggests the significance of the vision and its impact on those witnessing it.",
