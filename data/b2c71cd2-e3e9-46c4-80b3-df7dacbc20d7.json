    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a regal enthroned figure, likely Christ, holding a golden orb, gesturing with one hand. Before him kneels a crowned figure, presumably the Virgin Mary, with hands clasped in prayer. Several winged angels attend the scene: two are positioned behind the enthroned figure, one holding a crown, and another two are near the kneeling figure, one of whom holds a staff. The figures are set within an architectural space suggested by a richly decorated canopy and a patterned textile backdrop. The floor is tiled in a green and black checkerboard pattern. The entire scene is framed by an elaborate border with floral motifs and gold ornamentation.",
