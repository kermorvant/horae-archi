    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, stands to the left, her hands clasped in prayer or contemplation, looking down. Beside her is an ox, its head visible. To the right, a figure, likely Saint Joseph, lies on a bed covered by a red cloth patterned with gold vines and flowers, his head resting on his hand. The stable is constructed of wooden beams and has a thatched roof. Behind the figures, a wall with arched niches is visible. The ground is covered with a green checkered pattern. The entire scene is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs and geometric patterns.",
