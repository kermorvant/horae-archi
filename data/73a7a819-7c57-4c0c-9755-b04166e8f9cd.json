    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family during their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, cradles the Christ Child, who is also haloed. They are accompanied by Saint Joseph, who is bearded and wears a cap, carrying a staff. A donkey stands to the right, and an ox is visible below the Christ Child. In the background, a stylized cityscape with buildings and hills suggests their destination or a place of rest. The figures are rendered in a woodcut style with bold outlines and hatching for shading.",
