    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures within an architectural setting. On the left, a man with a beard is visible behind a brick wall, looking out from an opening. To the right, two crowned figures, also bearded, stand side-by-side. The central figure wears a crown and a robe adorned with dots, and both figures have their hands clasped in front of them. The architecture suggests a fortified or elevated structure, with visible walls and arched openings.",
    "scene_interpretation": "While the specific scene is not definitively identifiable without further context, the presence of crowned figures and the architectural elements could suggest a scene involving royalty, possibly a depiction of kings or a biblical narrative involving royal figures. The posture of the figures, with clasped hands, might indicate prayer, supplication, or contemplation.",
