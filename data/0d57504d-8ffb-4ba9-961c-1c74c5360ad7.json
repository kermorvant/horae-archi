The figure raises two fingers in a gesture of blessing or teaching. Above and to the left, within an oval frame, a smaller haloed figure, possibly Christ, is depicted seated on a throne, with arms outstretched, wearing a red garment and holding a golden orb. The background features a patterned tapestry in red and gold, and a blue sky with golden clouds. The ground is a green and white checkered pattern.",
