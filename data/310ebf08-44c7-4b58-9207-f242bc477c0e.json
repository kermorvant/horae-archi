    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, some on horseback or camel-back, engaged in what appears to be a procession or journey. A central figure, clad in armor and a helmet, holds a sword. To their right, two figures in hats are visible, one holding something in their hands. Camels are prominent in the composition, suggesting travel through a desert or exotic region. The background is abstract, with stylized foliage or drapery. The overall impression is one of movement and possibly a narrative event, though the specific context is not definitively clear from the visual elements alone.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too abstract and lacks specific iconographic markers to definitively interpret a religious, biblical, liturgical, or devotional meaning. It could potentially represent a biblical journey, such as the Adoration of the Magi, or a historical event, but without further context or clearer iconography, such interpretations remain speculative.",
