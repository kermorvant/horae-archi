    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial vision, with a radiant sun-like halo at the center, containing the monogram 'IHS' in blue and gold. A dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers above. Surrounding this divine light are numerous angels with colorful wings, some kneeling in adoration. Below, a crowd of people, including royalty (indicated by crowns) and clergy (indicated by miters), gaze upwards. In the foreground, a child, representing Christ, sits on a white platform, holding a cross. The lower corners of the image show demonic figures in a dark, turbulent landscape, contrasting with the heavenly and earthly realms above. The entire composition is framed by an ornate golden border with inscriptions.",
