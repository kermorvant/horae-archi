    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a haloed male figure wearing a crown of thorns, armor, and a cape. He holds a banner with a cross design in his left hand and a bundle of arrows in his right. The figure is depicted in a frontal pose against a landscape background with distant buildings. The armor is decorated with crosses, and a sword is visible at his waist. The overall impression is of a martyred saint, possibly Saint Sebastian, given the arrows, or Christ as the Man of Sorrows, indicated by the crown of thorns and the wounds implied by the armor's design.",
