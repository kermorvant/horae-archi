    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of a man wearing a cap with a prominent circular ornament on its crown. He has a beard and is dressed in a robe with a circular emblem on the chest and another on the hip. He holds a staff or scepter in his left hand, topped with a similar circular ornament. The background features decorative elements, including what appears to be foliage or a patterned textile, and architectural framing with pointed arches and decorative tracery. The overall style suggests a woodcut or engraving, possibly from a printed book.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image does not depict a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional scene. It is likely a portrait or a symbolic representation of a figure, possibly a saint, a king, or a person of importance, indicated by the regalia-like ornaments. Without further context, a precise interpretation is not possible.",
