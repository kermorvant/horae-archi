    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two male figures seated within an oval frame. The figure on the left, wearing a blue robe over a brown tunic, holds an orange book and gestures with his left hand. The figure on the right, similarly dressed in blue and brown, holds an orange book and raises his right hand, index finger extended, as if speaking or teaching. Above them, a dove with outstretched wings, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a circular halo. The background is a rich gold, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The figures are seated on a bench-like structure with orange and brown stripes. The oval frame itself is decorated with blue and brown foliate motifs.",
