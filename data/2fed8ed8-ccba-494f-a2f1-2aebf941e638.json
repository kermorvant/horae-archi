    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a woman, identified by her halo and serene expression, standing in a wooden barrel. Flames are visible beneath the barrel, suggesting she is being subjected to torture or martyrdom. Several figures surround her: a man with a beard and a crown, with his hands clasped in prayer, possibly a king or a judge; another man behind him, also with clasped hands; and two figures in the foreground, one wearing a helmet and holding a pole, and another figure behind him. In the background, architectural elements suggest a building with arched openings and towers. The overall scene appears to be an execution or martyrdom, likely of a saint.",
