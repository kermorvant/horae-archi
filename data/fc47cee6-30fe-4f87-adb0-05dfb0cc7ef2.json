    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, kneels in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a manger surrounded by straw. To the left, two figures peer through an arched opening, one pointing towards the scene. To the right, a bearded man in a green hood and yellow robe also prays, his hands clasped. In the background, the heads of a donkey and an ox are visible, and a single candle burns on a golden stand. The architecture suggests a simple, rustic structure with wooden beams and walls, and small, recessed windows.",
