    "scene_description_enriched": "In a pastoral setting, a woman with long blonde hair, dressed in a golden-brown tunic, sits outside a rustic hut with a thatched roof. She is breastfeeding an infant while a younger child, also in a similar tunic, looks up at her. The hut is constructed with rough-hewn logs and branches, with a visible window. To the right, a man with a beard and long hair, wearing a torn golden-brown tunic, stands holding a scythe, looking down. The background features rolling green hills, trees, and a path winding through the landscape. The scene depicts a family in humble circumstances, likely representing the Holy Family in their early years or a general scene of rural life.",
