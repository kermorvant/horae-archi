    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned female figure, likely a saint or queen, stands in a verdant landscape, holding a book and resting her hand on a wooden cross. The cross is inscribed with the letters 'INRI' on a banner. The figure wears a blue robe over an orange garment and a golden crown. The background is a rich red tapestry adorned with intricate gold patterns. Above the scene, a decorative arch frames the image, featuring floral motifs and a blue sky.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a female saint or a devout queen, possibly Saint Helena, who is credited with finding the True Cross. The presence of the cross with the inscription 'INRI' (Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum - Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews) strongly suggests a connection to the Passion of Christ or the veneration of the True Cross. The book she holds could represent scripture or a devotional text.",
