    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts three figures, two women and one man, in what appears to be a devotional or narrative scene. The central figure, a woman, is positioned between two other individuals. The figure on the left, a man wearing a crown and a feathered headdress, looks upwards and to the right. The figure on the right, a woman also wearing a crown, looks upwards and to the left. The central woman's gaze is directed forward. All three figures are depicted in profile or three-quarter view, with flowing hair and elaborate garments. The scene is framed by a border, and the background is plain, suggesting an indoor or abstract setting. The figures' hands are clasped or gesturing, indicating interaction or prayer. The style is characteristic of early woodcut illustrations, with bold outlines and hatching for shading.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is not clearly identifiable as a specific biblical or devotional event based solely on the visual information. However, the presence of crowned figures and the devotional gestures suggest a narrative involving royalty or significant individuals, possibly from a biblical story or a saint's life, or a scene of prayer and supplication.",
