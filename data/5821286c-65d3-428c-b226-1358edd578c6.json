He is dressed in a light blue robe and a golden cloak. Rays of golden light emanate from the upper left, directed towards the scene. In the center, a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, flies downwards. On the right, the Virgin Mary kneels, her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a blue robe and a halo. She is positioned before an open book on a wooden lectern. Behind her, a red curtain with gold decorative elements is drawn back, revealing a green curtain. The floor is tiled with a checkered pattern. In the background, a window with diamond-shaped panes is visible within a stone wall.",
