    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a halo, gesturing with his right hand towards a kneeling figure who also has a halo. Above the kneeling figure, a dove descends within a golden sunburst, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The man stands within an architectural structure featuring arches and columns, suggesting a sacred or public space. Behind him, a crowd of figures with halos looks on, some engaged with a book. The architecture is open to the exterior, with glimpses of a landscape or sky in the background. This scene is likely the Annunciation, where the Angel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary that she will conceive Jesus.",
