    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by several figures. Christ, in a blue robe, bears the heavy wooden cross on his shoulders, his head bowed and haloed. He is chained by the wrist to a soldier in green. To his left, a woman in a blue mantle, presumably the Virgin Mary, with a halo, reaches out towards him, accompanied by another figure in red. Behind Christ, several soldiers in helmets and varied attire, some carrying weapons, follow. To the left, a pink building with arched openings and columns suggests an urban setting. The ground is grassy, and the sky is a deep blue with scattered stars and a red banner flying from a pole.",
