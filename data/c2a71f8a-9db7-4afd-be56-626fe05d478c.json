    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ, with Christ tied to a column in the center. Two figures, likely Roman soldiers or tormentors, are shown administering the punishment. One on the left holds a bundle of rods, poised to strike, while the other on the right grabs Christ's arm. Christ is depicted with a loincloth and a green cloth draped over his head. The setting appears to be an interior courtyard or a loggia, with architectural elements such as arches, columns, and walls visible. The background suggests an outdoor landscape with distant buildings.",
