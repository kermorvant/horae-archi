    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, possibly a saint or a noblewoman, is depicted in profile, looking to the left. She wears an elaborate headdress adorned with a flower and a veil. Her neck is decorated with a necklace, and her garment features decorative buttons. Her left hand is raised, fingers splayed, in a gesture of speech or blessing. Her right hand is held lower, also with fingers extended. Behind her, a banner with Gothic lettering is visible, though the text is partially obscured. The background is filled with a stippled pattern, suggesting a decorative or symbolic setting. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling a pointed arch with ornamental tracery.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The gesture of the raised hand and the presence of the banner with lettering suggest a figure of importance, possibly a prophetess or a saint, engaged in speaking or proclaiming. The overall composition and the architectural framing point towards a devotional context, likely from a Book of Hours or similar illuminated manuscript.",
