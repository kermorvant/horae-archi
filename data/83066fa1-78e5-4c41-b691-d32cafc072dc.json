    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central, veiled woman. The figures on the left and right appear to be observing or interacting with the central figure, with some gesturing with their hands. Above the central figure, a stylized representation of a divine presence or event is suggested by abstract forms and radiating lines. The setting is enclosed within a circular frame, with hints of vegetation at the bottom. The overall composition suggests a moment of spiritual significance or revelation.",
