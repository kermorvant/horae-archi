    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Lawrence, who is shown standing in a large wooden tub over a fire. He is surrounded by a crowd of figures, some of whom are soldiers with spears and swords, and others appear to be onlookers. In the background, a figure dressed in royal attire rides a white horse, accompanied by other individuals. To the left, a serene figure, possibly a scribe or prophet, is seated and writing in a book, with a landscape and buildings in the distance. The overall setting is framed by an ornate architectural border, suggesting it is an illustration within a manuscript.",
