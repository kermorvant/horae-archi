    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large blue wings and a halo, kneels and gestures towards the Virgin Mary. He is clad in a golden-brown robe over a white tunic. Above him, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light. On the right, the Virgin Mary, also with a halo, stands with her hands clasped in prayer before a lectern covered with a green cloth. She wears a blue mantle over a darker garment. The background features a grey wall with architectural details suggesting a vaulted ceiling or alcove. Below the figures, a scroll with Latin text is unfurled, accompanied by a coat of arms and decorative elements that appear to be stylized wings or armor.",
