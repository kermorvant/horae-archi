He wears a monastic habit, a halo encircles his head, and his face and habit are marked with red stigmata, suggesting martyrdom. He holds a red book in his left arm and a stone in his right hand. Several other stones are scattered around his feet. The background features rolling green hills, stylized trees, and a golden ground texture on some elevated areas. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
