    "scene_description_enriched": "A king, seated on a throne and wearing a crown and ermine-trimmed robe, gestures with his right hand while holding a scepter. He is surrounded by several figures, including a man in armor to his left and other men standing behind him. To the king's right, a figure with long hair, possibly representing a prophet or a significant biblical character, stands and appears to be speaking or listening. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element, suggesting an interior setting, possibly a throne room or a courtly audience.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a royal audience or a moment of judgment, possibly related to a biblical narrative involving a king and a supplicant or advisor. Without further context, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of authority, justice, and counsel.",
