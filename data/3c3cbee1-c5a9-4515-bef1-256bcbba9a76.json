    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a simple architectural structure, possibly a stable. On the left, the Virgin Mary, with a halo, cradles the Christ Child, who also has a halo. To the right, three kings, distinguished by their crowns, approach. One king kneels, presenting a chalice filled with what appears to be gold coins. Another king stands, holding a lantern-like object, and the third king, also standing, holds a similar object. The background features a checkered floor and a wooden roof structure. The overall scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
