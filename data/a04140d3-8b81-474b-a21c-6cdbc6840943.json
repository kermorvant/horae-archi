    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher wading through water, carrying the Christ Child on his shoulders. Saint Christopher, a large bearded man, leans forward, gripping a staff for support as he navigates the turbulent water. He wears a patterned tunic and a simple robe. The Christ Child, depicted with a halo, sits atop Saint Christopher's shoulders, also with a halo, and raises a hand in blessing. In the background, a small building with a monk holding a lantern is visible to the left. Further in the distance, a windmill stands, and beyond that, a town with a church spire and trees line a road. The overall setting is outdoors, with a sense of journey and divine protection.",
