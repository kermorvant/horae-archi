    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, crowned and seated, holding the Christ Child on her lap. She is surrounded by a retinue of seven female saints, also crowned and with halos, suggesting their virginity and martyrdom. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by arches and columns, with a patterned floor. In the background, a landscape with trees and hills is visible through the arches. To the right, a small, stylized building resembling a tower or a small castle is depicted. The overall composition suggests a devotional scene, likely the Madonna and Child enthroned with attendant virgins.",
