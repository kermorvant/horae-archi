    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, centrally positioned with her hands clasped in prayer and a golden halo around her head. She is surrounded by four winged figures, likely angels, who are also in prayerful or reverent poses. One angel in a yellow robe kneels to the right, while another in white kneels to the lower right. To the left, an angel in white leans towards Mary, and another in a pinkish-red robe kneels below. A small cherubic figure in red is positioned at Mary's feet. The figures are depicted against a blue, starry sky, with hints of green landscape at the bottom and decorative elements at the top, suggesting a celestial or heavenly setting. The overall composition evokes a sense of divine adoration and heavenly peace.",
