    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint Mark by the presence of his symbol, the winged lion, sits on a throne-like chair, writing on a scroll. He is dressed in a blue mantle over a red tunic and wears a halo, indicating his saintly status. The lion, also with a halo, stands to his left, looking towards the scroll. The background is a decorative mosaic of red, blue, and gold squares. The scene appears to be set within an architectural space, suggested by the throne and the patterned wall.",
