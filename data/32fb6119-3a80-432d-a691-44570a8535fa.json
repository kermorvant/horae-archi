    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a bearded man, likely a saint, seated on a throne-like chair, wearing a halo and a white robe. A deer is shown nuzzling his hand, which rests on an open book. To the left, a young man in a tunic and hat stands near a decorative screen adorned with fleur-de-lis. The background features Gothic architectural elements, including ribbed vaults and arched windows with tracery. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern. This scene is interpreted as Saint Eustace, a Roman general who, according to legend, saw a vision of a stag with a crucifix between its antlers while hunting, leading to his conversion to Christianity.",
