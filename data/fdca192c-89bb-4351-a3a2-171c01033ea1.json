    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man wearing a green robe and a red turban is kneeling before a large, open book resting on a wooden lectern. The book is open to a page with musical notation. The man's hands are clasped in prayer or contemplation. To the left of the lectern, a brown, animal-like figure is partially visible. The background features a blue, patterned wall and a checkered floor. The scene likely depicts a devotional act, possibly a monk or scholar engaged in prayer or study of sacred texts.",
