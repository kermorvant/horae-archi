    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures. The figure on the left wears a bishop's mitre and a richly decorated rose-colored robe with gold trim. This figure's hands are clasped, and they appear to be holding something small and white. The figure on the right wears a dark robe with gold vertical stripes and a red hat. This figure's right hand is extended towards the other figure. The background is a solid blue, suggesting a non-specific or divine setting. The overall impression is one of solemnity and perhaps a formal exchange or blessing.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a bishop bestowing a blessing or conferring an office upon another individual, possibly a cleric or a patron. The gesture of the bishop and the attire suggest a formal religious or ecclesiastical context. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical event is not identifiable, but it aligns with devotional imagery of ecclesiastical authority and spiritual guidance.",
