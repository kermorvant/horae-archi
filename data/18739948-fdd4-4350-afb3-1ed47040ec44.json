    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, cradles the Christ Child, who is also haloed and naked. They are positioned within a simple wooden stable. The first Magus, an elderly man with a long white beard, kneels and offers a golden chalice filled with coins. Behind him, another Magus, wearing a crown, looks on, holding a golden orb. A third Magus is partially visible behind them. In the background, a procession of figures with spears and crowns approaches, with a walled city and castle visible on the horizon under a blue sky with a yellow sunset. Golden rays emanate from the upper left, suggesting divine light.",
