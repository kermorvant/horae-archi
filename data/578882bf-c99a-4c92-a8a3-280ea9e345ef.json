    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a manger. An ox and a donkey are present, their heads bowed. In the background, a humble dwelling with a thatched roof is visible, and beyond that, a pastoral landscape with rolling hills, a river, and scattered buildings. A lone figure, possibly a shepherd or a pilgrim, stands in the middle ground, facing the scene.",
