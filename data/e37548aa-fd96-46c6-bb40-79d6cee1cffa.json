    "scene_description_enriched": "In a nocturnal scene under a starry sky, Christ kneels in prayer on a grassy hill, his hands clasped and his gaze directed upwards towards a golden chalice bathed in divine light. Around him, his disciples sleep, some resting their heads on their arms, others curled up. In the background, a wooden structure, possibly a shelter or part of a garden, stands beside a simple wooden fence. The overall atmosphere is one of solemnity and divine communion amidst the slumber of his followers.",
