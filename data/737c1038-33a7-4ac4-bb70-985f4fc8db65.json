Her right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or speech, while her left hand holds a golden chalice. The background depicts rolling hills, scattered trees, and distant, stylized rock formations under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The foreground is a sandy or earthy ground with some indistinct objects. The scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
