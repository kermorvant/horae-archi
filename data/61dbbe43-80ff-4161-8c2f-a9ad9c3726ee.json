    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely a saint or holy figure, distinguished by a white veil and a habit adorned with a cross, stands in a grassy outdoor setting. She is shown distributing alms or blessings to a group of people gathered around her. To her left, a woman in a red dress is seated near a large woven basket filled with what appear to be loaves of bread. The background features a decorative tapestry-like pattern of red diamonds and blue and gold squares, suggesting an elevated or symbolic space. The figures are rendered in a stylized medieval manner, with expressive faces and simple garments.",
