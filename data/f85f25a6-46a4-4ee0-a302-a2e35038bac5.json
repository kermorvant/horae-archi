    "scene_description_enriched": "In a celestial scene, Christ, depicted with a beard and long hair, sits enthroned on a blue orb representing the Earth. He is dressed in a blue robe and a pink mantle, with wounds visible on his hands and feet. Rays of light emanate from his head, and he raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing or judgment. Flanking him are two winged figures, likely angels, one on each side. The angel on the left wears an orange tunic and has green wings, while the angel on the right wears a green tunic and has orange wings. Both angels appear to be playing musical instruments, possibly trumpets or pipes. Below this divine assembly, a green landscape is depicted, populated by several disembodied heads and a single nude figure facing away from the viewer, seated on a star-like form. These elements suggest a scene of resurrection or judgment.",
