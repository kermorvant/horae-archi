    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child, also with a halo. Saint Joseph, with a grey beard and wearing a blue cap and a pinkish robe over a yellow tunic, walks beside the donkey, carrying a staff over his shoulder. They are in an outdoor setting with rolling green hills, rocky outcrops, and scattered trees. In the background, a city with towers and spires is visible. Golden rays descend from a blue sky with wavy patterns, suggesting divine presence. The scene is framed by an ornamental border with floral motifs.",
