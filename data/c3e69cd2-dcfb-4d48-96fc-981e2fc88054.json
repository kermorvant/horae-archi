To his left, a demonic figure with horns and sharp claws is visible. To his right, several individuals are depicted, some with hands clasped in prayer, suggesting supplication or devotion. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch, with decorative foliage and a creature (possibly a lion or dragon) depicted within its upper curve.
