    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a genealogical tree, likely representing the lineage of Christ. At the bottom, a sleeping figure, possibly Jesse, lies on a green landscape. From his body, a stylized tree or vine emerges, bearing numerous figures. These figures, depicted as kings or patriarchs, are seated on green, leaf-like structures. Many wear crowns or elaborate hats and regal attire. One figure at the top holds a child, likely the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child. The background is a clear blue sky with faint golden motifs. In the distance, a stylized architectural structure resembling a castle or tower is visible on a hill.",
