    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in an outdoor setting. On the left, a man in a red tunic and striped leggings stands next to a large, golden haystack, gesturing with his left hand. To the right, two figures on horseback are shown. The foremost figure, on a black horse, wears a red and gold tunic and a tall, dark hat, holding a white staff. The second figure, on a gold horse, is dressed in blue and red, with a red conical hat. The background features rolling green hills, some brown mounds, and distant structures that appear to be buildings or tents under a blue sky. The entire scene is framed within a circular border decorated with floral motifs.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a biblical or historical event, possibly involving a journey or a meeting. Without further context or clearer iconography, a specific interpretation is difficult. The haystack might suggest a harvest or agricultural theme. The figures on horseback could be travelers, soldiers, or figures of authority.",
