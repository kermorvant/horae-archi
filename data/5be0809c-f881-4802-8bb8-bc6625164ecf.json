    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely Christ, wearing a red robe and a crown, holding a globe in his left hand and raising his right hand in a gesture of blessing. Before him, the Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. To her right stands a young angel with yellow wings, also looking towards Christ. Above, another angel with red and orange wings descends, holding a crown, possibly signifying the Coronation of the Virgin. The background features a patterned tapestry and a bed with red drapery, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a royal chamber or a symbolic representation of heaven.",
