    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures gathered around a baptismal font. On the left, a bearded man in a blue robe with gold trim looks upwards towards a dove radiating golden light, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. In the center, a golden, ornate font with water flowing from it is prominent. To the right, another bearded man, draped in a green mantle over a red garment, gestures with his hands, looking towards the font. A third figure, partially obscured and kneeling, is positioned at the base of the font, with their head bowed. The background features a blue sky with stylized trees and distant architectural structures, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall composition, with the dove and the baptismal font, strongly indicates a depiction of the Baptism of Christ.",
