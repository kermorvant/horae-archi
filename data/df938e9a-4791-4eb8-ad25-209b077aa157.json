The Virgin Mary, cloaked in blue, presents the Christ Child to an elderly man wearing a bishop's mitre and vestments, who holds the child. Behind Mary stands a woman in red holding a basket, and behind her, an older man with a staff. To the right, a richly decorated altar-like structure is visible, with a red frontal and a white, patterned cloth draped over it. The background features a patterned tapestry and architectural elements suggesting an interior space, possibly a church or temple.",
