    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit, also known as Pentecost. In the center, a figure with a blue robe and a golden halo, likely representing Christ or the Virgin Mary, holds an open book and gestures with one hand. Surrounding this central figure are several other figures, all with golden halos, seated in a circle. They are depicted with beards and wear robes of red and pink. Above them, in the upper part of the image, a white dove with outstretched wings, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, descends from a blue sky. The figures are seated on a floor with a checkered pattern of green and black squares. The entire scene is framed by a decorative gold border.",
