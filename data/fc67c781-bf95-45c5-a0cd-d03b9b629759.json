    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ in glory, seated on a golden orb, with his wounds visible on his chest and feet. He is surrounded by a radiant halo and a decorative, patterned background. To his left, the Virgin Mary kneels in prayer, her hands clasped. To his right, a male figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also kneels in prayer, looking upwards. In the lower part of the scene, the ground is depicted as green with stylized plants and several disembodied faces emerging from the earth. Two winged, blue demonic figures are visible in the upper corners, seemingly observing the scene. The overall impression is one of divine judgment or ascension, with earthly figures interceding or witnessing.",
