    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure with a halo, dressed in a blue tunic and a reddish-purple cloak, holds an orange book. The figure is seated on a structure composed of two stacked architectural elements, resembling stylized columns with decorative capitals. Above and to the right, a white winged form, possibly an angel, descends from a cloud-like formation. The background is a rich, textured gold leaf, suggesting a divine or celestial setting. The scene is likely an illustration from a Book of Hours, depicting a devotional moment.",
