    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by two figures. Christ, with a halo, is shown from the waist up, bearing a large wooden cross on his right shoulder. He wears a patterned robe. To his left, a figure in a brown tunic, also with a halo, holds a hammer and appears to be assisting or tormenting Christ. To Christ's right, another figure in a yellow tunic, also with a halo, pushes against the cross. The background is a deep blue dotted with small red and white stars, suggesting a celestial or symbolic setting. The figures stand on a green, undulating ground. The entire scene is enclosed within a circular frame adorned with gold and red decorative elements.",
