    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child, also with a halo. Joseph, dressed in a pink robe and yellow head covering, walks beside the donkey, leading it by a rope. They are in a verdant landscape with a body of water in the background, possibly a river, where boats are visible. The background is adorned with a decorative, grid-like pattern of gold, blue, and pink squares, suggesting a stylized representation of the sky or a celestial realm. Trees are scattered throughout the landscape.",
