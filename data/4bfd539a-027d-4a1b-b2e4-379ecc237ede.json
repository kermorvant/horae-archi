    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before a draped altar. On the altar lies the Christ Child, held by an elderly man with a grey beard, likely Simeon, who gazes down at the infant. Behind Simeon stands a woman, possibly Anna, and another figure in a blue tunic, possibly a priest or attendant, holds a green canopy over the altar. The background suggests an interior architectural setting with vertical wooden beams and an arched opening revealing a blue sky. Decorative floral motifs frame the scene on the left.",
