She holds a red object to her mouth. To her right, a bull and a donkey are visible. In the center, the Christ Child lies on a white cloth, appearing to be reaching for his mouth. On the right, Saint Joseph, with a golden halo and a white beard, wears a brown hooded robe and clasps his hands in prayer. The background is a rough, brown, cave-like structure with faint vertical lines suggesting light or rays from above.",
