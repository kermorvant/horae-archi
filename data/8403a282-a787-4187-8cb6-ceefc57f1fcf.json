    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men gathered around a central figure identified as Christ, who is shown with a halo and clasped hands. To his left, two men are visible, one with a beard. To Christ's right, a man with a beard and a distinctive collar is speaking, while other figures are present in the background. A donkey's head is visible in the foreground, suggesting a journey or entry. Behind the figures, architectural elements are depicted, including what appears to be a building with windows and a decorative archway framing the scene. The overall impression is one of a religious discourse or event.",
