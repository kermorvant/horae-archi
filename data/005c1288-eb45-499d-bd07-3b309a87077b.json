    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross in the center. To the left, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, kneels with her hands clasped. To the right, a figure, likely John the Evangelist, stands with his head bowed and hand to his face in grief, wearing a blue tunic and an orange cloak. Above and behind them, a group of figures with red and orange headwear are visible, possibly representing onlookers or soldiers. In the background, a stylized landscape with green hills and a blue, grid-like sky is rendered, with a distant building resembling a tower or church spire. The entire scene is framed by a decorative border.",
