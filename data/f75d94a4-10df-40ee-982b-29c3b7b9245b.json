    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act of infanticide, likely the Massacre of the Innocents. A king, seated on a raised platform and wearing a crown and royal regalia, presides over the scene. To his left, a soldier in armor is in the process of striking down a child, while another soldier appears to be holding a child aloft, possibly to be killed. A woman, dressed in a grey habit, cradles a baby, her face etched with sorrow. In the foreground, a woman in a pink garment lies prostrate, mourning over a dead child. The background is adorned with a rich, red and gold geometric pattern, suggesting an interior setting or a stylized representation of a royal court.",
