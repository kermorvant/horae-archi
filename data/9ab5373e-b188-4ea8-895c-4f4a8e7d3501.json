    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, the Archangel Gabriel, with large, feathered wings and a golden halo, descends from a divine light, holding a scepter. He is dressed in a blue tunic and a golden mantle. He gestures towards the Virgin Mary, who is seated on the right, reading from an open book placed on a gilded lectern. She wears a red dress and a blue mantle, and also has a golden halo. Behind her is a bed with red drapery and green curtains. A vase with lilies stands on the tiled floor in the foreground. Through an open doorway in the background, a classical building with arches and a figure can be seen.",
