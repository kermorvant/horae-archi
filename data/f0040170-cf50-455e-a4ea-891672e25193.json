    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross, his body showing wounds and blood. To the left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, with her hands clasped in sorrow. To the right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, holds an open book and looks upwards. The background is a rich, patterned textile in crimson and gold, suggesting a divine or symbolic setting. Above Christ's head is a blue cloud-like element with a face, possibly representing God the Father or the Holy Spirit. The ground below is depicted with scattered bones and a skull, symbolizing Golgotha, the place of the skull, and the triumph of death over sin through Christ's sacrifice. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
