    "scene_description_enriched": "Four winged figures, identified as angels, are depicted surrounding a golden cross adorned with jewels. The angels, each with distinct colored wings and robes, are shown reaching out to touch or support the cross. The background is a vibrant blue, suggesting a celestial or ethereal setting, with swirling patterns that could represent clouds or divine light. Below the angels, a multitude of faces are visible within the blue expanse, possibly representing souls or humanity. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements at the top corners.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents the Veneration of the Cross or the Triumph of the Cross, a significant devotional theme in Christianity. The angels' interaction with the cross emphasizes its sacredness and power. The presence of faces below could symbolize the salvation or redemption offered through Christ's sacrifice on the cross.",
