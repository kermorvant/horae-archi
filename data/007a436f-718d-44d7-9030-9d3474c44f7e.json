    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a loggia or open portico, with a lush landscape visible beyond. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with blue wings and a halo, points towards the Virgin Mary on the right. He wears a richly patterned brown robe over a blue tunic. Rays of golden light emanate from a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descending towards Mary. Mary, also with a halo, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, wearing a blue mantle over a blue dress. The inscription \"AVE GRATIA PLENA\" (Hail, full of grace) is visible in the background. The architectural setting features classical columns and an ornate entablature, suggesting a refined, possibly Renaissance-inspired, architectural style.",
