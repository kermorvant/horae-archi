    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men in a landscape setting. On the left, several men are gathered, with one kneeling in prayer before a tree. In the center, a richly dressed man with a turban gestures outwards. To the right, a large building with an arched entrance is visible, labeled 'babilonie', and a crowd of people are entering. Above, a haloed figure, likely Christ, is depicted in a circular frame, with birds flying in the sky. In the background on the left, a city with spires and walls is labeled 'jerusalem'. The overall scene appears to represent a narrative or allegorical event, possibly related to the biblical story of the Israelites in Babylon or a similar theme of exile and return.",
