    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a single figure, likely a saint or a royal personage, standing within an architectural frame. The figure wears a headdress and a pleated garment adorned with decorative elements at the shoulders. They hold a staff or scepter in their right hand and raise their left hand with two fingers extended, possibly in a gesture of blessing or teaching. The architectural setting appears to be a niche or an archway, suggesting an interior or a framed representation. The style is characteristic of medieval woodcut illustrations.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's gesture of raising two fingers is often associated with Christ or a saint giving a blessing or teaching. The scepter suggests authority or sainthood. Without further iconographic clues, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it likely represents a devotional figure within a religious context.",
