She is clad in a voluminous white robe with a cowl, and holds a golden crozier in her left hand and a jeweled book in her right. The background depicts rolling hills, trees, and a small building with a pitched roof. The scene is rendered with delicate brushwork and gold accents, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
