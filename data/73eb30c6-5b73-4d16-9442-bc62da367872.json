    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, being greeted by Elizabeth, who wears a pink mantle over a blue dress and a white veil. An angel, clad in a golden robe, stands to the left of Mary, with hands clasped in prayer. The figures are set in an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, trees, and a rocky outcrop. In the background, a body of water reflects a city with prominent towers and spires, suggesting a distant urban setting. Golden rays emanate from above, illuminating the scene.",
