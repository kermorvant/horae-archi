    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral procession or burial. In the foreground, two figures are engaged in placing a body, wrapped in white cloth, onto a wooden plank or bier. One figure, wearing a red tunic and blue hose, kneels and supports the body, while another figure in a grey tunic and red hat also assists. Behind them, a procession of figures in dark robes, some holding torches, moves forward. A central group includes a cleric in ornate vestments holding a book and a processional cross, accompanied by a child in a white robe holding a smaller cross and what appears to be a representation of the Christ Child. In the background, architectural elements suggest a church or religious building with arched openings and columns, under a sky with divine rays emanating from above. The overall scene is framed by decorative borders typical of illuminated manuscripts.",
