    "scene_description_enriched": "A Franciscan friar, identified by his blue habit and tonsured head, kneels in prayer outdoors. He looks upwards towards a winged figure, possibly an angel, who is depicted with a halo and holding a wooden cross. Red threads connect the figure to the friar's hands and chest, and a small arrow pierces his hand, symbolizing stigmata. The background depicts a winding path through a green landscape, with trees, a body of water, and a distant walled city with towers and red-roofed buildings. The scene is set against a blue sky with scattered clouds.",
