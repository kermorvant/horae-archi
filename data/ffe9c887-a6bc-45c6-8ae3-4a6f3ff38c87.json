    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a winged figure, likely an angel, descending from a richly decorated architectural canopy. The angel holds a cross and a globe, symbols of Christ's dominion. Below, a kneeling figure, presumably a saint or a devout individual, with hands clasped in prayer, looks up towards the angel. The background features architectural elements, including what appears to be a building with arched windows and a tower, suggesting an urban or ecclesiastical setting. The overall composition suggests a divine visitation or a moment of spiritual revelation.",
