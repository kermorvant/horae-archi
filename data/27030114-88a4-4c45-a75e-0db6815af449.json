    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel, with golden wings and a green robe, stands to the left holding an open book. To the right, a bearded man, wearing a blue robe and a red cloak lined with gold, sits and writes in an open book. He has a halo and a blue headdress. The scene takes place indoors, within a space that features architectural elements such as arches and decorative friezes. In the background, within arched niches, are faint depictions of figures, possibly a religious scene. The overall impression is one of scholarly or divine inspiration.",
