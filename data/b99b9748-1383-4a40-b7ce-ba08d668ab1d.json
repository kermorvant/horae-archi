    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with feathered wings and a halo, kneels on a patterned floor, holding a branch and gesturing towards the Virgin Mary. Rays of light emanate from the upper left, illuminating a bird in flight. The Virgin Mary, on the right, also with a halo, stands with her hands clasped in prayer, her head bowed. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a pink gown. Behind them, a green curtain hangs, and the walls are rendered in a green brick pattern. A golden lectern is positioned between the figures. The background shows a blue sky with stylized trees.",
