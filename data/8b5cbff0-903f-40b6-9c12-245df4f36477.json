    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation of a child, likely the Christ Child, to a group of figures. A man in ornate robes and a tall, jeweled hat holds the child, who is swaddled and has a halo. He stands behind a table or altar-like structure. To his left, a man in a clerical robe stands with his hands clasped. In front of the table, a woman kneels, her head bowed and hands clasped in prayer, draped in a dark cloak. Behind her, an older man with a beard leans on a staff. To the right, a young woman holds a basket containing what appears to be fruit or offerings. The background suggests an interior space with arched windows and a patterned ceiling or canopy.",
