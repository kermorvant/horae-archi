    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within a framed illustration. At the center, a figure wearing a crown of thorns and a halo is being mocked and struck by others. To the left, a figure in armor, possibly a soldier, holds a stick. Behind him, two other figures, one with a beard, also appear to be involved in the torment. To the right, another figure, also holding a stick, strikes the central figure. The figures are rendered in a linear style with hatching to suggest form and shadow. The background is a plain gold surface, typical of manuscript illumination, with horizontal lines indicating the page structure.",
