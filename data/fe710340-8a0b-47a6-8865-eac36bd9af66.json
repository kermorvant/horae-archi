    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, is kneeling and praying, her hands clasped. Beside her, Joseph, also with a halo, holds a candle. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies on the ground, and to the left, an ox is visible. The figures are situated within a rudimentary architectural structure, possibly a stable, suggested by the presence of animals and the shelter-like construction above. The overall impression is one of humble reverence and the divine birth.",
