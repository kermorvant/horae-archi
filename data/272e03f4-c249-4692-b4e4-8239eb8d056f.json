    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned king, seated on a throne and holding a scepter, is surrounded by several figures. The king wears a red tunic and a blue mantle, both adorned with gold. The figures around him are depicted in various colored garments, including green and red. The scene is set within an architectural space, suggested by a golden, arched canopy above and a dark, recessed background. The floor is decorated with gold leaf and green patterns. The overall impression is one of royal authority and courtly presence.",
