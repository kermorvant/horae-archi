    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint John the Evangelist by his halo and traditional iconography, is depicted writing in a manuscript. He is seated within a wooden architectural structure that resembles a lectern or a scribe's booth, complete with decorative tracery and a canopy. Before him is a slanted desk holding an open book and inkwell. To his right, on a separate stand, are two more books, one green and one open with text. The background is a rich gold leaf, typical of illuminated manuscripts, suggesting a divine or elevated setting. The scene is interpreted as Saint John the Evangelist writing his Gospel, a common theme in Books of Hours, emphasizing the divine inspiration of scripture.",
