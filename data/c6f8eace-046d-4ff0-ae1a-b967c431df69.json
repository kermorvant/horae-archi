    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle, kneels before a richly decorated bed or altar where the Christ Child sits. Joseph, holding a basket containing two doves, stands behind Mary. To the right, a figure in a bishop's mitre and blue robe, likely Simeon, holds the infant. Another figure, possibly Anna, stands behind Joseph. The background features architectural elements suggesting a temple or church interior, with arched windows and decorative stonework. A red canopy hangs above the scene, and the figures are framed by an archway with ornamental details.",
