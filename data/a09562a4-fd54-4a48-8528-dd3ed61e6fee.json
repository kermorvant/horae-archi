    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely Christ, with a halo, raising a whip or scourge in his right hand, gesturing towards a table laden with coins and goods. He is dressed in a long robe. To his right, a man in a cap looks towards him with a concerned expression, his hands clasped. Other figures are partially visible in the background. The architectural setting appears to be an interior space with columns and decorative arches, suggesting a temple or market setting. This scene is interpreted as Christ driving the money changers out of the Temple, a pivotal event in his ministry.",
