    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint, stands centrally in the foreground, holding a processional cross and a book. The figure wears a vibrant red cloak over a blue tunic, with bare feet visible. Behind the figure, to the left, is a building with a steeply pitched roof and multiple windows, suggesting a domestic or civic structure. To the right, a stylized landscape unfolds with trees and distant architectural silhouettes, possibly a town or city. The overall scene is set outdoors, with a clear sky above.",
