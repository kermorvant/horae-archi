    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe, holds the Christ Child, who is reaching towards a golden vessel offered by a kneeling king. Another king, in blue and gold, presents a similar vessel, while a third king, in green, stands behind him. A tonsured monk, holding a tambourine, stands to the left of Mary. In the background, figures are visible on a wooden staircase, and a horse is tethered. The setting is rustic, with wooden beams and a thatched roof, suggesting a humble dwelling. The overall scene represents the recognition of Christ's divinity by the Gentile kings.",
