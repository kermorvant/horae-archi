    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures, identified as apostles by their halos, are depicted seated on a green grassy landscape. The figure on the left, wearing a golden robe over a blue tunic, is looking down at a scroll unfurled before him, upon which he appears to be writing. The figure on the right, dressed in a blue robe, is also writing on a scroll, with a quill in his hand. Behind them, a body of water with small boats is visible, leading to a city with tall buildings and spires. In the background, a large, golden, rocky mountain dominates the left side of the scene, and a blue, conical mountain, possibly a volcano, is seen behind the city. The sky above is a vibrant blue with scattered white and gold clouds.",
