    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a solemn gathering within an arched architectural space, likely a chapel or a private oratory. In the foreground, a black catafalque, adorned with gold trim, rests on a yellow tiled floor. Two candles in ornate golden candlesticks flank the catafalque. To the left, a richly decorated altar or funerary monument is visible. Behind the catafalque, a group of four figures in black monastic habits are gathered, their faces obscured by hoods, suggesting a moment of prayer or mourning. To the right, three figures in more elaborate attire, including one in a vibrant red and gold cope, are looking at an open book placed on a wooden lectern. The background features blue drapery with gold fleur-de-lis motifs and red arched canopies, hinting at a noble or royal context. The overall atmosphere is one of reverence and remembrance, likely depicting a funeral service or a memorial observance.",
