He holds an open book in his left hand and his crosier in his right. The background depicts a blue sky with scattered stars, a green hill, a rocky outcrop with a tree, and in the distance, a white building with spires and a dome, suggesting a church or city. The scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
