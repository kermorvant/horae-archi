    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man kneeling in prayer, his hands clasped and his gaze directed upwards. He is richly dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold stars and a fur-trimmed collar, kneeling on a green checkered floor. Beside him lies a harp, and in the foreground, a jeweled object rests on a pink and white striped cushion. Behind him, a decorative tapestry hangs on the wall. To the right, an ornate architectural element, possibly a doorway or niche, frames a view of a distant city with towers and walls. Above, in a celestial realm depicted with a blue sky and golden rays, a winged angelic figure, possibly an angel, descends towards the man, accompanied by a larger, more divine figure radiating light and holding a scepter. The overall scene suggests a moment of divine intervention or revelation.",
