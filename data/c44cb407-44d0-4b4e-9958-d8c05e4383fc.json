    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a crowned male figure, likely a saint or a king, with a long beard and flowing hair. He is adorned in ornate robes and wears a large crown. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or teaching, with two fingers extended. In his left hand, he holds a staff topped with a cross, and rests it on a globe. Surrounding the figure are several star-like motifs. The overall style is that of a woodcut illustration, characteristic of medieval manuscripts.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's regalia (crown, ornate robes) and the cross suggest a royal saint or a significant religious figure, possibly a king canonized for his piety or a representation of Christ as King. The gesture of blessing and the globe are common attributes of Christ or saints. The stars might allude to divine light or a specific biblical prophecy.",
