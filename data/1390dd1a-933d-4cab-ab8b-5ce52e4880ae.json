    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a winged ram standing on a decorative pedestal, holding a staff topped with a cross and a banner. The ram's head is turned to the right, and it appears to be pouring liquid from a chalice held in its front hoof. Below the ram, a bearded figure wearing a helmet or elaborate headdress is visible, with other figures surrounding them. The background is filled with hatching lines, suggesting a textured or possibly celestial setting. The overall composition suggests a symbolic or allegorical representation, possibly related to a religious or astrological theme.",
