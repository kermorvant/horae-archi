    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men, distinguished by their ornate hats and robes in gold, blue, and red, are gathered in the foreground. One man in a gold robe holds a scroll, which appears to be a text, and the others are looking at it. Behind them, a lush green landscape unfolds with rolling hills dotted with trees. In the distance, a majestic castle with multiple towers and spires stands prominently against a blue sky with golden clouds. The scene is rendered with meticulous detail, including the texture of the fabrics and the foliage, and the use of gold leaf highlights.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a moment of scholarly or religious discussion, possibly related to the reading or interpretation of a sacred text. The presence of the castle in the background could symbolize authority, power, or a specific location relevant to the narrative. Without further context, a precise biblical or devotional interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of knowledge, wisdom, and perhaps a historical or prophetic event.",
