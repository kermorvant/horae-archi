    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures, each with a halo, stand against a gold background. The figure on the left wears a blue robe over a white tunic and holds a small orange object in his hands. The figure on the right wears a pinkish-red robe over a white tunic and also holds a small orange object. Both figures have distinct facial features and hairstyles. The scene is framed by decorative borders.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The presence of halos suggests these are holy figures, likely saints or apostles. The objects they hold could be symbolic, such as books or relics, but without further context, a specific interpretation is difficult. The gold background is typical of medieval religious art, signifying a divine or heavenly realm.",
