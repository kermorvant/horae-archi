    "scene_description_enriched": "Within an arched frame, a kneeling figure, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted in a landscape. She wears a blue mantle over a red and gold striped garment and a golden halo with radiating rays. She cradles a dark vessel, possibly a censer or a pot, in her arms. The background features rolling green hills under a blue sky, with a suggestion of a building or structure at the top. The scene is framed by decorative borders, including gold leaf and a pattern of white dots on a reddish-brown background.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the Virgin Mary mourning over the body of Christ, which is represented by the dark vessel she holds. Alternatively, it could represent the Entombment of Christ, or a devotional image of the Virgin Mary in sorrow.",
