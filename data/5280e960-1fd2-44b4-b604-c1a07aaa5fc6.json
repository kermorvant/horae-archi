    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an interior space characterized by a vaulted ceiling and columns. In the foreground, a figure in a blue robe with a red hood kneels, presenting something to a figure in a pink robe who is holding a white cloth. To the left, two other figures are visible, one in a yellow tunic and red hat, and another in a blue robe and gold halo. The floor is decorated with a diamond pattern. The architectural setting suggests a formal or religious interior.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely an episode from the life of a saint or a biblical narrative, possibly involving a presentation or offering. The halos suggest the presence of holy figures. Without further context or clearer iconography, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of devotion and reverence.",
