    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in a mitre and ornate golden cope lined with blue, stands holding a crozier. He gestures with his right hand towards a woman who is lying down, covered by a white veil. The background depicts a dark, interior space with architectural details suggesting a room or chamber, possibly within a religious building. The bishop's gesture and the woman's posture suggest a scene of healing or absolution.",
