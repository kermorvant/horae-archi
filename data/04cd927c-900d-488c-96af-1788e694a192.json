    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an arched architectural setting. On the right, an older man with a long beard, wearing a distinctive hat and ornate robes, is shown interacting with a younger man. The younger man, dressed in simpler attire, stands facing him, with his hands clasped. To the left of these two central figures, two other individuals are partially visible, also appearing to be engaged in the scene. The background suggests an interior space with patterned walls and architectural details suggesting a building. The overall composition, with its focus on interaction and the presence of figures in formal attire, hints at a significant event or encounter.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a moment of counsel, judgment, or a formal meeting. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or devotional event cannot be definitively identified. However, the presence of figures in distinct attire and the formal interaction suggest a narrative moment of importance, possibly related to a saint's life, a biblical episode involving authority figures, or a scene from a historical or allegorical text.",
