    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, likely a king or noble given his attire and crown, kneels in prayer with his hands clasped. He is positioned within an architectural setting that includes a large arched opening. To his left, through this opening, a fortified city with multiple towers and crenellations is depicted under a dark, cloudy sky from which divine rays emanate, suggesting a divine presence or blessing. To his right, a series of tall, narrow windows with tracery are visible, indicating an interior space. An open book lies on a surface near the kneeling figure, and a candle holder with a candle is also present. The scene likely represents a moment of devout contemplation or supplication.",
