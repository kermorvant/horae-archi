    "scene_description_enriched": "A mallard duck is depicted in profile, walking from left to right. The duck has a dark blue head and neck, with a reddish-brown breast and body. Its wings are folded, and its tail is fanned slightly. The background is a blue sky with some wispy clouds, and a landscape of rolling hills in muted green and brown tones. The ground is a sandy color with small, dark oval shapes scattered across it, possibly representing droppings or seeds. The entire scene is framed by a decorative border with circular motifs containing blue and pink elements, interspersed with green and gold accents.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a naturalistic depiction of wildlife, possibly intended for decorative purposes within a Book of Hours, or as part of a larger allegorical or symbolic context related to creation or the natural world. Without further context, a specific religious interpretation is not possible.",
