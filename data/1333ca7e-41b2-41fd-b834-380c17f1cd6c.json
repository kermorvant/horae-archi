    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ Child in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle, presents the Christ Child to an elderly man, likely Simeon, who is seated and dressed in white robes. Behind Mary stands a man with a beard and a halo, possibly Joseph, holding a staff. To the left, a young woman in a pink dress carries a basket. Above, a divine figure, representing God the Father, is depicted within a golden halo and surrounded by rays of light, with a blue celestial background dotted with stars. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting suggested by arched doorways and a patterned backdrop. The Christ Child is reaching towards Simeon, who is holding him. The scene is framed by decorative borders with floral motifs.",
