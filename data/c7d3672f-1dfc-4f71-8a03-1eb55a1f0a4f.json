    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated centrally, surrounded by a group of figures, all with golden halos, suggesting they are apostles or disciples. Above them, a white dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light emanating from it. The figures are gathered in a space with a patterned floor and a backdrop of red and blue panels adorned with decorative motifs. The Virgin Mary is depicted with clasped hands, looking downwards, while the surrounding figures gaze upwards towards the dove, their hands also in prayer or supplication. The overall composition suggests a moment of divine inspiration or descent of the Holy Spirit.",
