To the left, three figures stand, two of whom are women with halos, likely the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene, in mourning. To the right, a soldier is shown hammering a nail into Christ's foot. The setting is a rocky, barren landscape with a tree stump in the foreground. The overall composition is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
