    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and white veil, with her head bowed and hands clasped in a gesture of sorrow or contemplation. Beside her stands a young man, possibly Saint John the Evangelist, wearing a red tunic and looking towards the viewer with a pensive expression. In the background, a wooden cross is partially visible, suggesting a connection to the Crucifixion. The figures are rendered with delicate brushstrokes, and their halos indicate their sacred status. The overall mood is one of solemnity and devotion.",
