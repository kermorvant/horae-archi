    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded men, depicted in profile, are shown. The man on the left wears a red cap with a small pom-pom and a green tunic. The man on the right wears a green, conical hat and a reddish-brown robe. Both men have long, flowing hair and beards, and are adorned with necklaces. They are positioned in front of a stylized architectural element that appears to be a column or pillar, suggesting an indoor or possibly a semi-architectural setting. Their gestures, with index fingers pointing, might indicate dialogue or emphasis within a narrative scene. Without further context, the specific devotional or biblical meaning is unclear, but the figures' attire and presentation suggest they are important individuals, possibly biblical figures or saints.",
