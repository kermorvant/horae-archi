    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, with clasped hands and a halo, standing centrally and surrounded by numerous winged figures, likely angels. These figures are depicted in various dynamic poses, some reaching towards Mary, others looking upwards. They are adorned in red and gold garments, with prominent red wings. The background is a vibrant blue, suggesting a celestial or ethereal setting. At the bottom of the image, a decorative border is visible, with what appear to be stylized representations of clouds or architectural elements below Mary's feet. The overall impression is one of reverence and divine protection surrounding the Virgin.",
