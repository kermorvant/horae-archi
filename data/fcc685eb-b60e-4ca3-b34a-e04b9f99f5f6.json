    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross in the center. To his left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. To his right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, stands with his hands outstretched in a gesture of lament or supplication. The figures are set against a blue sky with hints of clouds and a distant landscape. The entire scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch supported by columns, with decorative golden elements along the top and sides.",
