    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an interior space. A haloed woman in a golden gown kneels on the left, her hands clasped. To her right, a child is seated on a raised platform. Several men, some wearing turbans and elaborate robes, stand behind the child. The background features a wall with diamond-patterned windows and a green tiled floor. The overall impression is one of a devotional or religious gathering, possibly related to the presentation of the child.",
