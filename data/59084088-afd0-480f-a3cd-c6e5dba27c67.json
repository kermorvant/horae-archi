    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures, likely the Apostles, gathered together with their hands clasped in prayer and their faces turned upwards. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a patterned, diamond-shaped canopy above, with rays of light emanating from it towards the figures. One figure in the foreground is seated with an open book on their lap. The setting is a grassy area, suggesting an outdoor location, though the patterned canopy overhead hints at a divine or celestial presence.",
