    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of women, each holding a chalice-like vessel, standing within an architectural setting that features arched openings and decorative elements. Behind them, a grotesque, beast-like figure with a human-like face and fur is visible, seemingly interacting with the architecture. The women are dressed in long robes, and their expressions are varied, suggesting a narrative moment. The overall impression is one of a devotional or allegorical scene, possibly related to a parable or a moralizing tale, given the presence of the monstrous figure.",
