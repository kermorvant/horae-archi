    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity seated on a throne. On the left, God the Father, with a beard and a halo, is shown with his hand raised in blessing. In the center, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers between them, its wings spread. On the right, God the Son, also bearded and with a halo, wears a blue cap, possibly representing a mitre, and holds an open book. Both figures are robed in red with gold detailing. The throne is elaborate, with pointed architectural elements and a rich, golden background. The overall composition suggests a divine and solemn representation of the Trinity.",
