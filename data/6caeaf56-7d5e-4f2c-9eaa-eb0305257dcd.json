In the foreground, the Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and head covering, kneels and holds the Christ Child, who is naked and has a halo. She looks up at the child with devotion. To the left, a woman in a pink dress, also with a halo, stands holding a basket. In the background, a man with a red hat and green tunic sits on a bed, looking down at the child. The room features a patterned red tapestry, a bed with a canopy, and windows with diamond-shaped panes. The overall scene suggests a moment of tenderness and religious significance within a domestic setting.",
