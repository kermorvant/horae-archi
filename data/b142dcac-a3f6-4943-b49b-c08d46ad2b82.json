    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a saint or holy figure, is depicted holding an open book in his hands. He wears a hooded robe, and a halo encircles his head, signifying his sanctity. The background is filled with a dense, dark foliage, suggesting an outdoor or natural setting. The figure's gaze is directed slightly to the viewer's left, and his left hand appears to be holding a staff or crosier. The overall impression is one of contemplation and scholarly devotion.",
