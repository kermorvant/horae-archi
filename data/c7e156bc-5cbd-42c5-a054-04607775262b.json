    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a body of water teeming with several fish swimming in unison. On the left, a large, gnarled tree with dense foliage stands prominently. In the background, rolling hills and a distant, rocky outcrop are visible. On the right, a cluster of trees and foliage frames the scene, with a suggestion of a rocky embankment. The overall impression is a natural landscape focused on aquatic life.",
