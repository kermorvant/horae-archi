    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two haloed women, likely saints or biblical figures, meeting outdoors. The woman on the left, dressed in a white veil and a pink robe with a blue mantle, is shown with her hands clasped. The woman on the right, wearing a blue robe over a pink garment, extends her hands towards the other. Behind them, to the left, is a grey stone building with decorative elements and a tall, blue-capped tower. To the right, a brick tower with a similar blue cap rises against a backdrop of a green, hilly landscape dotted with trees and fields. A low stone wall separates the figures from the landscape. The overall impression is one of a devotional encounter set within a semi-urban or monastic environment.",
