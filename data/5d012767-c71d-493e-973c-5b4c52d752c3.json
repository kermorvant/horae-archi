    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man, identified as Saint Mark by the presence of his attribute, the lion, is depicted writing in a manuscript. He is seated at a wooden desk, holding a quill pen and a feather, with an inkwell and a book of texts nearby. The lion, also seated, appears to be assisting or observing the writing process. The scene is set within an interior space with stone walls and a window revealing a landscape outside. The architectural elements suggest a study or scriptorium.",
