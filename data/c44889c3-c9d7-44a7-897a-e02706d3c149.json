    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, adorned in a jeweled mitre and ornate cope, stands over a wooden tub filled with water. He holds a crozier in his left hand and points with his right index finger, wearing a white glove and a ring, towards three nude children partially submerged in the tub. The children appear to be looking up at the bishop with reverence. In the background, through an open doorway, a man in a green tunic and red cap is visible, looking towards the scene. The architectural setting is suggested by a dark, tiled wall and a decorative frieze above, implying an indoor, possibly ecclesiastical, space.",
