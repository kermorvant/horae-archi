    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted riding a donkey, accompanied by a man in a red cloak and hood, possibly Saint Joseph. They are traveling through a landscape with a body of water in the background. To the left, a cylindrical structure with an arm-like appendage is visible, possibly representing a well or a primitive mechanism. The scene evokes a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or the Visitation, given the figures and the context of a Book of Hours.",
