    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a nighttime encounter in a rocky, hilly landscape under a starry sky. Christ, with a radiant halo, stands centrally, facing forward. To his left, a figure, likely an apostle, stands looking down. Around them, numerous soldiers lie fallen and seemingly incapacitated, some with weapons scattered. A torch burns in the foreground, illuminating some of the fallen figures. The overall impression is one of divine power overcoming earthly opposition.",
