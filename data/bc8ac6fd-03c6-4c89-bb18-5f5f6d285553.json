    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Flagellation of Christ. Christ, naked and bound to a post, is being scourged by two figures. One figure, dressed in blue and red hose, raises a whip or implement to strike Christ. Another figure, dressed in red and blue hose, is bent over, possibly in the act of preparing to strike or having just struck. A golden, radiant background composed of small squares in red, blue, and gold suggests a divine or significant setting. Rays of golden light emanate from above, illuminating the scene.",
