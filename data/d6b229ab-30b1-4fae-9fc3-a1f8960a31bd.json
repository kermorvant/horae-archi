    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a pastoral setting with several figures. In the foreground, a woman in a long orange gown gently strokes a white sheep. To her left, a man kneels with his hands clasped in prayer, wearing a red tunic and a black cap. Behind them, a figure in a blue robe and red cloak sits playing a lyre-like instrument. Above them, in the upper part of the image, a winged cherub floats in the sky, holding a scroll. The background features stylized green trees and rocky terrain, with a stream flowing between the figures. The overall impression is one of peaceful devotion and pastoral life, possibly representing a biblical scene or a devotional allegory.",
