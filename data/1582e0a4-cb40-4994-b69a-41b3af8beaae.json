    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large, feathered wings and wearing a blue robe over an orange cloak, gestures towards the Virgin Mary. He holds a golden staff. The Virgin Mary, on the right, is seated on the floor, dressed in a blue gown and a peach-colored mantle, with her hands crossed over her chest. An open book lies before her. Above her, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is depicted within a radiant halo of rainbow-colored light. The background shows an interior space with arched doorways and columns, suggesting a grand hall or a church interior. The floor is tiled. A coat of arms is visible on the wall.",
