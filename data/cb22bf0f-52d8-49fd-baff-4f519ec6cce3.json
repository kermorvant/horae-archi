    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed woman, her body almost entirely obscured by long, flowing brown hair, stands with her hands clasped in prayer. She is depicted in a lush, green forest setting with numerous trees and foliage. In the background, a rocky, orange-hued hill rises against a blue sky, from which golden rays emanate, suggesting divine light. A serpent is visible emerging from behind a tree trunk on the left. The scene is framed by an ornate, decorative border.",
