    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in a garden setting, framed by decorative borders. On the left, a bearded man with a halo, dressed in a red tunic and blue mantle, extends his hands towards a crowned man on the right. The crowned figure, wearing a blue robe and a pink mantle lined with ermine, clasps his hands together in a gesture of supplication or greeting. Behind them, a red tapestry with gold ornamentation serves as a backdrop, and beyond that, a line of stylized green trees suggests an outdoor environment. The ground is depicted as green grass. The interaction between the two figures, one divine and the other royal, suggests a significant encounter.",
