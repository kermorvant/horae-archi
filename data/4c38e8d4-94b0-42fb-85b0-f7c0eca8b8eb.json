    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, wearing a tall, conical hat adorned with a circle and a dot, and a flowing robe, stands with his right hand raised to his face, appearing contemplative or in prayer. Behind him, a cityscape unfolds with various buildings, including towers with crenellations and domed roofs, and structures with arched windows. The scene is rendered in a woodcut style, with stark lines and hatching to depict form and shadow. The man's posture and attire suggest a figure of importance, possibly a prophet or a king, within a devotional context.",
