    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men gathered in what appears to be an interior space, possibly a hall or courtyard, with an arched entryway leading to a darker interior with a Gothic window. In the foreground, a central figure, possibly Christ, is depicted with wounds and a crown of thorns, draped in a red robe. He is surrounded by other men, some of whom are gesturing or holding scrolls with inscriptions. The architectural elements suggest a medieval setting, with a large pink column on the left and an arched opening. The overall atmosphere is somber, suggesting a religious narrative.",
