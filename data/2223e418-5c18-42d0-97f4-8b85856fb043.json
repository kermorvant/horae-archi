    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, possibly the Virgin Mary, is depicted seated and holding a young deer or fawn in her lap. Her head is bowed, and her gaze is directed downwards. She wears a head covering and a long, draped garment. To her right, a flowering plant with large leaves is visible. The scene is framed by decorative elements at the top and bottom, suggesting it is an illustration within a manuscript or printed book. The presence of the deer, often a symbol of Christ's Passion or purity, alongside a woman in a contemplative pose, suggests a devotional context.",
