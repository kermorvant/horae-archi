Behind her, a red tapestry with a repeating circular motif adorns the wall. To her right, a wooden lectern holds an open book. The room features arched windows with tracery, and a vaulted ceiling is visible above. To the left, an arched opening reveals an outdoor landscape with a tree and a hill under a blue sky. The floor is covered with a green patterned carpet.",
