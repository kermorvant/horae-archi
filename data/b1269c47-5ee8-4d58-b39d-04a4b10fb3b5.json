    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, crowned with thorns and bleeding. Below, to the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, is shown with her hands clasped in sorrow. Beside her, a woman in a golden robe kneels and reaches towards the cross. To the right, a man in elaborate attire, possibly a dignitary or soldier, gestures with his hands, while another figure in armor stands behind him. In the background, a stylized city with purple walls and towers, some topped with golden spires, is visible under a blue sky. The ground is rendered as a golden, undulating landscape.",
