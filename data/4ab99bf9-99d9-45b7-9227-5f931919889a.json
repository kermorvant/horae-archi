    "scene_description_enriched": "A young woman with long, golden hair and a halo stands centrally, draped in a blue mantle over a red tunic. Her right hand is raised, with two fingers extended in a gesture of blessing or teaching, while her left hand rests near her chest. She is flanked by two large, serpentine forms, rendered in green with red markings and gold accents, which appear to coil around her. In the background, a dark, textured wall is visible, with a small, barred window showing a blue sky. The overall impression is one of spiritual significance, possibly depicting a saint or a symbolic representation of virtue overcoming evil, suggested by the presence of the serpents.",
