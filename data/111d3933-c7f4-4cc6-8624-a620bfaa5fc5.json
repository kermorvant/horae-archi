    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered around a central, veiled woman. The figures are rendered in a stylized, woodcut-like manner. The central woman, with long, flowing hair and a veil, appears to be the focus of attention. She is surrounded by several other individuals, some with their hands raised in gestures of prayer or supplication. The background is abstract, suggesting a rocky or hilly terrain, with some foliage indicated. The entire scene is contained within a circular frame, which is itself part of a larger decorative border.",
