    "scene_description_enriched": "Two men are depicted in what appears to be an indoor workshop setting. The man on the left, wearing a dark cap and a blue tunic with a gold-trimmed collar, holds a tool, possibly a knife or awl, and is actively engaged with a large, cylindrical object. This object, which resembles a vat or a large pot, contains a smaller red vessel within it. The man on the right, dressed in a red tunic and a pink cap, looks towards the object and appears to be observing or assisting. The background suggests an interior space with wooden beams and a hint of a wall. The scene likely represents a craft or trade, possibly related to metalworking or pottery, given the tools and vessels.",
