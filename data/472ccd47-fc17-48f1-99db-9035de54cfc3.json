    "scene_description_enriched": "A male saint, depicted with a halo, stands within an architectural setting. He is clad in full armor and wears a blue mantle lined with red and trimmed with gold. In his right hand, he holds a processional cross, and in his left, a sword. The background reveals an arched structure with columns, suggesting a loggia or arcade, with glimpses of a landscape through the openings. The architectural elements include columns, arches, and windows with tracery, all rendered in a stylized, somewhat flattened perspective typical of manuscript illumination. The overall scene is framed by an ornamental border.",
