    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated on a donkey, holding the Christ Child. She wears a blue mantle and a red garment. The Christ Child, also with a halo, is held in her arms. Behind them, Joseph, identifiable by his beard and red hat, walks alongside the donkey, carrying a staff over his shoulder with a bundle attached. He wears a yellow tunic and blue garment. The background is a starry blue sky, suggesting night or a celestial setting, with sparse green foliage and trees scattered across the ground. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with emphasis on their devotional significance rather than naturalistic representation.",
