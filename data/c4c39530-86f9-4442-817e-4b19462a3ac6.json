    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of people gathered around a table, engaged in what appears to be a meal or a social gathering. Several individuals are seated, while others stand. A prominent figure, likely a woman of status, is seated at the head of the table, adorned with jewelry. Men in various attire surround her, some gesturing or interacting with each other. In the background, a framed artwork or tapestry shows a figure lying down, possibly in distress or repose. The setting appears to be an interior space, suggested by the presence of a draped curtain and a window with diamond-shaped panes. Dogs are visible in the foreground, interacting with the figures. The overall atmosphere suggests a domestic or courtly scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is not clearly identifiable as a specific biblical, liturgical, or devotional event based on the visual cues. It appears to be a genre scene depicting a meal or gathering.",
