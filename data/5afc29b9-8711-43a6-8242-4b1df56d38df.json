    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her halo and blue mantle, embracing Elizabeth, who is also haloed and wears a white veil and an orange robe. Elizabeth carries a basket. To the left, an older man with a white beard, likely Zechariah, stands near the entrance of a simple stone building, holding a green bowl. The background features lush green trees and a blue sky with golden clouds, suggesting an outdoor setting. The architectural elements are minimal, with a focus on the figures and their interaction.",
