    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a rustic stable. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, reclines on a bed covered by a blue cloth, her arm extended towards the Christ Child lying in a manger. The manger is woven and contains the swaddled infant, with an ox and a donkey looking on. Two angels, also with halos, are present, one appearing to descend from above and the other looking down from a golden canopy. To the left, a group of figures, including a shepherd with a staff and a younger figure, are visible in a rocky, tree-filled landscape. To the right, an older man, possibly Joseph, stands with a staff. The background is a richly patterned tapestry of blue and red squares with gold accents. The overall scene is rendered with vibrant colors and gold leaf, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
