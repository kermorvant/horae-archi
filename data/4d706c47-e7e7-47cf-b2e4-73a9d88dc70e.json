    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in what appears to be an architectural setting. On the left, a figure with a distinctive hat is shown from the chest up, gesturing with their left hand. In the center, a figure, possibly a child, is held by another figure whose hands are clasped around it. To the right, a bearded figure, also shown from the chest up, wears a garment and appears to be looking towards the central figures. The background suggests architectural elements, with what look like towers or buildings with gabled roofs on either side, and a horizontal band above the figures that might represent a frieze or entablature. The overall style is a pen-and-ink drawing, characteristic of early manuscript illumination or woodcuts.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is too abstract and lacks clear iconographic markers to definitively interpret a specific religious or biblical event. However, the grouping of figures, particularly the central embrace, could suggest a devotional theme involving family or protection, but without further context or clearer depiction, a precise interpretation is not possible.",
