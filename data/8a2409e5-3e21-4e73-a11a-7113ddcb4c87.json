    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure with curly blonde hair and a golden halo is depicted against a dark, starry background. She wears a blue garment with puffed sleeves and a red cloak draped over her shoulders. Her left hand holds a golden vessel, open at the top, containing what appear to be small objects. A red orb is visible at her chest. The figure's gaze is directed upwards and to the left, with a sorrowful or contemplative expression. The overall impression is of a saintly figure, likely a martyr, identified by the vessel which often symbolizes the relics of a saint.",
