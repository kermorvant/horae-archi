    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child across a river. Saint Christopher, a large, bearded man with a halo, is wading through water, holding a tall staff for support. He is barefoot and wears a simple robe. The Christ Child, also with a halo, sits on Saint Christopher's shoulders, holding a globe and raising one hand in blessing. The river is populated with fish. In the background, framed by an arched border adorned with foliage, a city with numerous towers and buildings is visible under a radiant sun. The overall composition suggests a journey of faith and spiritual burden.",
