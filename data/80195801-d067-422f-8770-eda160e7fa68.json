The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer. Beside her, a woman in a red robe looks on. A group of men, identifiable as Apostles by their halos, stand behind them, some looking upwards. In the background, a grand architectural structure with tall, ribbed windows and arches is visible. Above, the Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove, radiating golden light and flames, symbolizing divine inspiration. The scene is framed by an ornate border with floral motifs.",
