    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Descent of the Holy Spirit, also known as Pentecost. A group of twelve figures, including the Virgin Mary seated centrally, are gathered indoors. They are depicted with halos, indicating their sanctity. The Holy Spirit is represented by a white dove descending from a luminous sky, with rays of light emanating from it towards the figures. The figures are shown with varied expressions of awe and devotion, some with hands clasped in prayer, others looking upwards. The architectural setting features arched openings and windows, suggesting a room or a loggia. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. The overall atmosphere is one of divine revelation and spiritual fervor.",
