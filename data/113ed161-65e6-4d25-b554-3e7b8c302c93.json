    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, likely a king due to the crown, is depicted seated. The figure wears a richly decorated garment with small dots and a patterned collar. The hands are clasped, holding a circular object, possibly a chalice or a reliquary. The scene is framed by decorative architectural elements, including an arch with foliate motifs and a serrated border at the top. The overall style suggests a devotional or narrative context within a manuscript.",
