    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, holding the Christ Child, is seated on a donkey. Saint Joseph walks beside the donkey, guiding it. To the left, another woman, possibly an attendant or a figure from the Nativity narrative, gestures towards the Virgin. The figures are set against a background with stylized trees and a golden, textured ground, suggesting an outdoor setting. The entire composition is framed by a large, ornate initial 'C' in red and gold, decorated with scrolling acanthus leaves and small floral motifs.",
