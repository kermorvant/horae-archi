He holds a cross with a banner. Around the sarcophagus, soldiers in armor lie stunned or are in the process of falling. In the background, a walled city with towers and buildings is visible, along with trees and birds in the sky. To the right, several figures, likely mourners or witnesses, are observing the event.",
