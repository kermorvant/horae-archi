    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted seated within an ornate, gilded architectural structure. She wears a blue gown and a golden headdress, her gaze downcast. In her hands, she holds a small wooden cradle. The structure she is in features decorative carvings of putti and floral motifs, with a canopy overhead. Behind her, glimpses of a richly decorated interior with arched elements and patterned walls are visible. The scene suggests a moment of quiet contemplation or preparation, possibly related to the Nativity or the presentation of the infant Christ.",
