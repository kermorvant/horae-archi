On the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe with gold embellishments, is shown reading a red book. Her left hand is raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. To her right, the Archangel Gabriel, adorned in a golden tunic with jeweled cuffs, holds a golden staff and points upwards. A scroll unfurls from his mouth with the inscription \"AVE. GRATIA. PLENA.\". Above them, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove, radiating golden rays. Behind the Virgin Mary, a window with diamond-shaped panes is visible, suggesting an indoor setting.",
