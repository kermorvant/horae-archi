    "scene_description_enriched": "A crowned woman, possibly a queen or saint, is seated on a throne. She holds a heart in her left hand and a star-like object in her right. Beneath her feet lies a defeated male figure, also crowned, suggesting subjugation or martyrdom. The scene is framed by ornate architectural elements, including a canopy with Gothic tracery and a large, domed structure above, all set against a starry background. The inscription \"L. chaste\" is visible at the top. This imagery likely represents a saint or allegorical figure associated with chastity and triumph over adversity.",
