    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle over a purple gown, meeting Elizabeth, who wears a golden robe and a white veil. Mary's left hand rests on her abdomen, while her right hand gently touches Elizabeth's arm. Elizabeth, with a more anxious expression, also reaches out to Mary. The background is a hilly landscape with trees and a distant castle on a hilltop. The figures are rendered with gold halos, indicating their sanctity. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
