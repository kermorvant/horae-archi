    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, predominantly male, are depicted with their hands clasped in prayer or supplication, their gazes directed upwards. The figures are dressed in flowing robes and head coverings, suggesting a devotional or religious context. The style is monochromatic, rendered in shades of blue and grey, with minimal architectural detail visible, hinting at an outdoor or perhaps a simplified setting. The overall impression is one of collective piety and anticipation.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a group of faithful individuals engaged in prayer or witnessing a divine event. Given the upward gaze and clasped hands, it could represent a moment of intercession, petition, or adoration, possibly related to a biblical narrative or a devotional practice common in Books of Hours.",
