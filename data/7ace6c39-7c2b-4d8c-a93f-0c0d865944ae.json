    "scene_description_enriched": "A saint, identified by a golden halo, is depicted riding a green dragon. The saint is seated on the dragon's back, with hands clasped in prayer. The dragon has red eyes and is holding a blue cloth in its mouth. The scene takes place within an architectural setting featuring brick walls, arched openings with blue, star-patterned canopies, and windows with diamond-shaped tracery. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern of blue and white with gold lines. The overall impression is one of a saint triumphing over a demonic creature within a stylized interior.",
