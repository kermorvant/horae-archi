    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint Peter by his attributes, stands in a simple architectural setting. He wears a blue mantle over a golden tunic. In his left hand, he holds an open book, and in his right, he carries a set of keys. Behind him, a wall constructed of grey bricks is visible, and to his right, a dark, shadowed architectural element suggests an interior space or a doorway. The ground is a light, neutral color, and the scene is bordered by a gold frame.",
