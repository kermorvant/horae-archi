    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene is divided into two distinct parts. On the left, a figure identified as 'David' is depicted indoors, wearing a royal blue robe adorned with gold fleur-de-lis and a golden crown. He is shown in a contemplative pose, resting his head on his hand and pointing outwards. A harp lies on the floor beside him, and the room features tiled flooring and windows with tracery. On the right, a divine scene unfolds with Christ, crowned and radiating a golden aura, standing with arms outstretched. He is surrounded by angels and figures, possibly the Virgin Mary and other saints, in a celestial setting. A scroll below the figures contains Latin text. The juxtaposition suggests a connection between earthly royalty and divine authority, possibly representing David's kingship and Christ's ultimate dominion.",
