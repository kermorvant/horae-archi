    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, holds the swaddled Christ Child, who has a halo. To Mary's left stands a woman in pink, possibly Saint Anne or another attendant, carrying a basket containing two doves. To the right, an elderly man with a long beard, wearing a green cloak and a red hat, stands behind an altar-like structure covered with a white cloth. He gestures towards the child, signifying the presentation. The background is a decorative tapestry with a repeating pattern of fleur-de-lis and diamonds in red, blue, and gold.",
