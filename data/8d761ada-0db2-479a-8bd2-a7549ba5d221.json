    "scene_description_enriched": "A winged, demonic figure with a purple face and clawed feet attacks a kneeling, elderly man who is partially covered by a white cloth. The demon holds a club raised to strike the man. Behind the figures, a stone building with crenellations and arched windows is visible, suggesting a castle or fortified structure. The background depicts a landscape with rolling hills and trees under a blue sky. This scene likely represents the Temptation of Saint Anthony, a common theme in medieval art where the saint is tormented by demons.",
