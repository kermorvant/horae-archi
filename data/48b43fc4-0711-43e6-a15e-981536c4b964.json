    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, bound and scourged, standing in the center. He is wearing a loincloth and has a halo. To his left, a man in a blue tunic and pink hose raises a whip, about to strike him. To Christ's right, two figures stand over him; one, in a tan tunic and blue hose, holds a stick, while another, wearing a crown and blue garment, looks on. Behind them, a brick wall forms the backdrop, with a hint of green landscape above. The scene is a representation of the Flagellation of Christ.",
