    "scene_description_enriched": "Two male figures, identified as saints by their halos, are depicted. The figure on the left wears a green tunic and a red mantle draped over his left shoulder and arm. He holds an open book in his left hand. The figure on the right wears a blue robe with gold trim and holds two books tucked into his belt. He also holds a sword or a similar implement in his right hand. Both figures have long, white beards and are rendered in a stylized, somewhat somber manner. The background is a plain, light color, suggesting a metaphysical or devotional space rather than a specific earthly location. The scene likely represents two apostles or early Church fathers, possibly in contemplation or teaching.",
