    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of Christ, rendered with a serene expression, eyes closed, and head slightly bowed. He has long, flowing brown hair and a beard. A golden halo surrounds his head, and his body is clad in a dark blue robe with gold detailing. The background is a rich, textured gold leaf, adorned with a repeating pattern of stylized floral or foliate motifs in reddish-brown. Christ's hands are visible, one gesturing slightly upwards, the other resting. The overall impression is one of contemplative devotion.",
