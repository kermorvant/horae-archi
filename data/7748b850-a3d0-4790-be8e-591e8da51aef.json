    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely Christ, seated and holding a staff. Around him are various figures and symbolic elements. To his left, a bird flies, and to his right, a figure stands, possibly an angel or a saint. Below, a group of people, some wearing crowns or elaborate hats, look upwards. The background is filled with a dense stippling, suggesting a starry sky or a celestial realm, with several small, boat-like objects or lamps arranged in a semi-circle below the central figure. A winged creature, possibly a bull, is visible on the left side, and another winged creature, possibly a lion, is on the right. The overall composition suggests a divine or apocalyptic vision.",
