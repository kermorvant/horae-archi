    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of men engaged in labor outdoors. In the foreground, two figures in red and blue tunics are working on a large, blue-covered object, possibly a sarcophagus or a large bundle, with one man holding a pole and the other preparing to strike it with an axe. To the left, a crowd of men in yellow and red tunics stand behind wooden poles, some appearing to be prisoners or laborers. To the right, a procession of men carries large white sacks over their shoulders, moving away from the central action. The background features a rocky hillside and a distant landscape with trees and hills under a pale blue sky. The overall impression is one of arduous work and possibly a procession related to burial or construction.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely a depiction of the construction of a tomb or the transportation of a significant object, possibly related to a burial. The presence of an axe and the effort involved in moving the covered object suggest a laborious undertaking. Without further iconographic clues, a specific biblical or devotional event is not definitively identifiable, but it could represent a scene of labor or a historical event involving the construction of a monument.",
