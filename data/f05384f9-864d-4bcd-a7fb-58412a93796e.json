    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in an outdoor landscape. One figure, standing and wearing a blue cap and red tunic, holds a long staff from which a small, winged, reddish figure is suspended. The second figure, seated and wearing a red cap and blue tunic, appears to be playing a stringed instrument. The background features rolling hills and rocky outcrops under a blue sky. The overall scene is framed by a decorative blue initial.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a pastoral or allegorical theme, possibly related to music or a shepherd's life, rather than a specific biblical event. The suspended winged figure could be interpreted as a cherub or an allegorical representation of inspiration or a muse, particularly given the presence of music.",
