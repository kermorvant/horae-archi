    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, with her lying on a richly decorated bed, covered by a blue mantle. She is surrounded by a crowd of figures, some of whom appear to be apostles, with halos indicating their sanctity. Christ is depicted in the upper background, surrounded by a golden aura and a mandorla, reaching down towards the Virgin. The architectural setting is a grand interior with columns and arches, suggesting a sacred space. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern. The overall impression is one of solemnity and divine intervention.",
