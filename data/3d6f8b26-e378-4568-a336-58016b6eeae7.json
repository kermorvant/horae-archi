    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a simple architectural structure, possibly a stable or a humble dwelling. The Virgin Mary, with a golden halo, is seated and cradles the Christ Child, who is also haloed. The Child reaches out towards a golden chalice offered by one of the Magi. The second Magus, also with a halo, gestures towards the scene. Behind them, a camel is visible, suggesting the journey of the Magi. The architecture is rudimentary, with wooden beams and a thatched or tiled roof suggested by the diagonal lines. The background is a mix of blue sky and a brown, textured landscape.",
