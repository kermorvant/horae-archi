    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. A robed figure, likely a priest, holds the Christ Child over a circular basin. Another figure, possibly Joseph, stands behind the Virgin Mary, who is cloaked in blue and looking down. A fourth figure, dressed in a hooded robe, kneels and supports the child. The background features a stone wall with arched openings and a green curtain. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern. The overall scene is rendered with a flat, stylized aesthetic typical of medieval illumination.",
