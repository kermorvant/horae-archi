    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel kneeling on the left, presenting a scroll with text to the Virgin Mary, who is seated on the right. Gabriel has green wings and wears a purple cloak over a white tunic. Mary, with a halo, is dressed in a blue robe and has her hands clasped over her chest, looking down. She is seated before a red-draped table with an open book. A golden vase with a sprig of greenery stands on the table. The background features a patterned red wall and green curtains. Above and to the left, a bust of a bearded man, possibly God the Father, is depicted within a blue circular frame, surrounded by rays of light. The floor is tiled in a red and brown checkerboard pattern.",
