    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, identifiable by his halo and gesture of blessing, standing against a dark, circular void. He is robed in a richly decorated garment with gold accents. Surrounding him, and emanating from behind the void, is a multitude of angels depicted in shades of blue and white, their forms suggested by flowing lines and subtle shading. Their faces are rendered with simple, serene expressions. The overall impression is one of divine power and celestial presence.",
