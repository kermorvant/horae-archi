    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a prophet, identified as Elijah, kneeling in a verdant landscape. He holds a leafy branch in his left hand and gestures with his right, looking upwards. Above him, in a celestial realm depicted with swirling clouds and golden light, a crowned figure, likely God, with a long white beard, points downwards. God is surrounded by a multitude of faces, suggesting heavenly hosts. In the foreground, a blue bowl overflows with golden objects, possibly representing manna or a divine provision, and a red feathered cap rests beside it. In the background, a body of water is visible with distant buildings and mountainous terrain, hinting at a worldly setting contrasted with the divine.",
