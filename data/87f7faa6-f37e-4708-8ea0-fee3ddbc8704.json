    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic and tumultuous event, possibly a depiction of hell or a similar infernal realm. In the foreground, several figures are shown in distress, some with their mouths open in cries of anguish. A central figure, possibly a demon or a monstrous entity, rides a beast resembling a donkey or a goat, wielding a staff or spear. This figure appears to be driving or tormenting the other figures. To the right, a grotesque, multi-headed creature, possibly a dragon or a sea monster, emerges from the lower part of the scene, adding to the sense of horror and despair. The background is filled with swirling clouds, suggesting a turbulent and otherworldly atmosphere. The overall impression is one of suffering, judgment, and the torments of the damned.",
