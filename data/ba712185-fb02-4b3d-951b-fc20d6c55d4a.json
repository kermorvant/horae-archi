    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in a hilly, outdoor setting with a castle in the background. The woman on the left, dressed in red and kneeling, reaches out to the woman on the right, who is standing and wearing a blue robe. Both figures have halos, indicating their saintly status. The kneeling figure appears to be greeting or showing deference to the standing figure. The presence of a castle suggests a narrative context that might involve travel or a specific location.",
