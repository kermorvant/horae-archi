    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. Mary, depicted kneeling with hands clasped in prayer and wearing a crown, is being crowned by an angel. To her left and right sit two figures, likely God the Father and Christ, both holding globes and wearing halos. The background is a starry blue sky, suggesting a celestial setting, with architectural elements that appear to be part of a heavenly structure or throne. The figures are richly robed in red and green, with gold accents, and the entire scene is framed by an ornate border.",
