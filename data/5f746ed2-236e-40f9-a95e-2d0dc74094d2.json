    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a solitary, bearded man, likely a hermit or saint, standing in a rocky, barren landscape. He wears a hooded robe and holds a long staff in his right hand, with a pouch hanging from it. His left hand is held near his chest, with fingers slightly curled. A halo encircles his head, and he wears a cap adorned with decorative symbols. In the background, a cave-like opening or architectural structure is visible, suggesting a dwelling or place of refuge. The overall impression is one of austerity and spiritual contemplation.",
