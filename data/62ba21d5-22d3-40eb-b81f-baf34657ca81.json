    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures, one an older man with a beard and a halo, dressed in dark robes, and the other a younger figure, possibly a child, also with a halo and dressed in white. The older man is looking downwards with a sorrowful expression, his hands clasped. The younger figure is looking forward. In the foreground, a scroll or band with text and a symbol (possibly a cross or an emblem) is visible. The background is dark and decorated with small, scattered motifs that resemble musical notes or droplets. The overall impression is one of solemnity and religious devotion.",
