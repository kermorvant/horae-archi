    "scene_description_enriched": "A mounted figure, dressed in a blue tunic and black leggings, is shown from the waist up, holding a sword. The figure is on a white horse with red trappings. To the right, a nearly naked man, possibly a beggar or supplicant, reaches out towards the mounted figure. The scene unfolds in a verdant landscape with rolling hills, scattered trees, and a body of water in the background. In the far distance, a city with spires and towers is visible. The entire scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
