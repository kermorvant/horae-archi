    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures, identified as angels by their halos and wings, are depicted in a celestial or heavenly setting. They are dressed in white robes and appear to be emerging from or floating on a blue, textured surface that could represent water or clouds. Some angels have red or purple wings, while others have golden halos. A scroll with purple lettering is unfurled between some of the figures, bearing text that appears to be in Latin. The overall impression is one of divine presence and heavenly assembly.",
