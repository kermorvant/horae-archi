    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts two figures flanking a central text block. On the left, a bearded man with a cap and draped clothing stands, holding a staff or scepter. On the right, another figure, also bearded and wearing a cap, is shown with hands raised in prayer or supplication. The figures are framed by decorative architectural elements resembling arches and columns. The text in the center reads: \"thzonuzeius:t mulier fugit in colitudinem habebat locū. &c.\", which translates to \"the dragon: the woman flees into the wilderness, she had a place. etc.\". This likely refers to a scene from the Book of Revelation.",
