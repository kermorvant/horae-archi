    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, crowned and with a halo, sits on the left, holding the Christ Child, who is also crowned and has a halo. The Christ Child is reaching out towards one of the Magi. One Magus, kneeling and crowned, offers a gift. He is dressed in blue and red robes. To the right, two other Magi stand, also crowned. The first stands in a green robe, holding a golden vessel, and gestures with his raised hand. The second stands behind him in a pink robe. They are positioned in front of a rustic, thatched shelter. The background features rocky terrain with trees and a golden, patterned sky, suggesting a sacred and somewhat otherworldly setting.",
