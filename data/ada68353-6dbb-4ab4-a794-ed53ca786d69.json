    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, adorned with a golden halo, cradles the Christ Child on her lap. She wears a vibrant blue gown embellished with gold patterns. Before them kneels one of the Magi, offering a golden chalice. Behind him stand two other Magi, also crowned and holding chalices, their faces turned towards the infant. In the background, a simple wooden structure with a thatched roof forms the stable, juxtaposed with more elaborate stone buildings featuring arched windows and turrets, suggesting a town or castle beyond. The overall composition is framed by an ornamental border with floral motifs.",
