The seated figure, also with a golden halo and wearing a black cap, blue robe, and a red cloak trimmed with gold, is holding and looking at a scroll. The scene appears to be set indoors, with a plain wall and a hint of architectural structure in the background. A blue, gold-patterned drapery hangs behind the seated figure. The floor is rendered with a checkered pattern.",
