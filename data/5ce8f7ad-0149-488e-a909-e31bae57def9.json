    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, holds the Christ Child on her lap. Three Magi are present: one kneels before them, offering a gift; another stands, pointing towards the child and holding a chalice; and the third stands to the side, also holding a chalice. Behind them, a simple, grey building with a pitched roof and a single window is visible, suggesting a humble dwelling. The background features rolling green hills and trees under a blue sky. The figures are richly dressed, with the Magi wearing crowns and elaborate garments, indicating their royal status.",
