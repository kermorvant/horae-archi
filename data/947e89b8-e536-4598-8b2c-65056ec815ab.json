    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an architectural setting framed by a golden arch. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large wings and wearing a golden robe, kneels and presents a scroll inscribed with \"AVE MARIA\". Facing him on the right, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer before an open book. The background features a pink wall with gold flecks, and behind it, a glimpse of a room with windows and what appears to be a bed canopy. The floor is tiled in a green and white checkered pattern. The overall scene is rendered with a devotional focus on the moment of divine revelation.",
