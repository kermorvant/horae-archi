    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a divine figure, likely God the Father, holding a cross with Christ crucified upon it. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is shown near Christ's head. To the left, a kneeling figure in an orange robe, presumably a supplicant or donor, is shown with hands clasped in prayer before an open book. The background is a rich blue with an intricate pattern of foliage. The figures are positioned in a space that suggests an altar or a sacred setting, with a simple architectural element supporting the cross.",
