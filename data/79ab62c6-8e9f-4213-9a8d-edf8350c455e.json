    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, kneels and offers the Christ Child to a bearded man wearing a mitre and a red and gold chasuble, likely a high priest. The Christ Child, with a halo, is held by another figure in red and gold robes, possibly Joseph, who stands behind Mary. To the left, a woman in green holds a basket containing two doves, representing the sacrificial offering. The background features a richly decorated architectural setting with a green curtain and a golden canopy above the figures. The scene is framed by an ornate border.",
