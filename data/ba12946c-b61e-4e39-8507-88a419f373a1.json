    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel on the left, winged and dressed in a tunic, gesturing towards the Virgin Mary on the right. The Virgin Mary, wearing a veil and a draped garment, is seated and appears contemplative, with her hand touching her chin. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior setting, possibly a room with a window or niche. The overall composition is framed by an arched structure.",
