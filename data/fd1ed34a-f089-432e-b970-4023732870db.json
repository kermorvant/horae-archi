    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central figure, likely a saint or a royal personage, standing triumphantly over a lion. This figure wears a crown, a blue tunic with fur trim, green hose, and a royal mantle lined with ermine. They hold a sword in their right hand and a helmet in their left. To the left, an angel with green wings and a green robe plays a harp. To the right, another angel with red and green wings and a blue robe plays a lute. The background is a rich tapestry of gold squares interspersed with blue and green, bordered by a wavy blue band with gold stars. The floor is tiled in a red diamond pattern. The overall impression is one of divine victory and heavenly celebration.",
