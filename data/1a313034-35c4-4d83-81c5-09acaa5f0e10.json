    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, crowned and seated, holding the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child is reaching for a small red object held by Mary. Two winged angels flank the central figures: one on the left plays a lute, and the other on the right plays a harp. They are positioned in a verdant, grassy setting with small flowers. Above them, in a celestial realm depicted with blue waves and golden rays, is a representation of God the Father, holding a globe and making a gesture of blessing. The entire scene is framed by an ornate border with decorative elements and Greek letters.",
