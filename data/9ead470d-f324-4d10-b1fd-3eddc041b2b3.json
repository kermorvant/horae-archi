    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures within an arched architectural setting, possibly a room or a chamber. In the foreground, a figure in a pink robe, identified as Christ, stands with raised hands, facing a woman in a blue hooded mantle. Behind Christ, three other figures with halos are visible, one in a red robe and two in darker garments. Above them, a white dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from a golden sky, with rays of light emanating downwards. The background features draped red and green textiles, suggesting a rich interior. The overall composition suggests a significant religious event, likely the Annunciation or a related theological moment.",
