    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within a richly decorated architectural setting. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with blue wings and a pink robe, gestures towards the Virgin Mary. He is positioned in front of a red, columned structure. On the right, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, looks down with her hand to her chest, holding a red heart. She stands before a green, intricately decorated wall with a shield bearing fleur-de-lis. The architecture features pointed arches, columns, and ornamental tracery, suggesting a Gothic style. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern. Above the figures, a divine face is visible within a radiant halo, and decorative architectural elements frame the scene.",
