    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity of Christ within a richly decorated architectural frame. In the foreground, the Virgin Mary, wearing a veil and a pink halo, cradles the Christ Child, who is swaddled in green. They are lying on a bed covered by a red blanket. To the right, a bearded man, possibly Saint Joseph, with a halo and dressed in an orange cloak over a brown tunic, sits and holds a green object. Above them, the heads of a cow and a donkey are visible, suggesting the stable setting. The background is a textured gold, indicating a divine or sacred space, and the entire scene is framed by elaborate golden architectural elements with black outlining, featuring Gothic tracery and decorative motifs.",
