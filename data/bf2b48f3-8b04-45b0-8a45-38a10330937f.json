    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated, holding the Christ Child. She wears a blue mantle over a white robe and a golden halo. The Christ Child, also with a golden halo, is held in her left arm and reaches towards a golden object she holds. To the right, a young boy kneels in prayer, dressed in a red robe adorned with gold crosses and blue hose, with a sword at his side. He is positioned before a lectern covered with a richly decorated cloth, upon which rests an open book. Behind the Virgin, a red curtain with gold patterns hangs, framing the scene. On the left, an angel plays a lute, and on the right, another angel plays a harp. The background is a starry blue sky, suggesting a divine or celestial setting, with architectural elements of columns and what appears to be a canopy above.",
