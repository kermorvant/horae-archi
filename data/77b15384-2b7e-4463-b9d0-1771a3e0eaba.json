In the foreground, several figures, possibly monks or choristers, are gathered around a lectern displaying a musical score. One figure in a white robe is actively engaged with the book. Behind them, a group of three men, one in a red robe and elaborate hat, another in a blue tunic and hat, and a third in a red robe and yellow hat, stand conversing. The background reveals architectural elements including arched windows with tracery, columns, and a vaulted ceiling, suggesting an interior space. To the right, a reliquary or sarcophagus rests on a raised platform, adorned with intricate architectural details.",
