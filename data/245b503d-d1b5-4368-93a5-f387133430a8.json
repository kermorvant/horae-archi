He holds a scroll inscribed with \"Ave gratia plena Dñs tecum\" (Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee). Rays of golden light descend from the heavens, carrying a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, towards Mary. The Virgin Mary, on the right, kneels in prayer with her hands clasped to her chest. She is seated before a wooden lectern with an open book. The setting is partially interior, indicated by a checkered floor and a large window with tracery, and partially exterior, with a landscape visible through an arched opening on the left, featuring trees and a distant castle. A red tapestry with gold ornamentation hangs on the right wall.",
