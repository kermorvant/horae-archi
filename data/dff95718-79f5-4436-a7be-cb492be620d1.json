    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The body of Christ, with visible wounds, is cradled by the Virgin Mary, who is dressed in blue. To the left, a figure in red, likely Saint John the Evangelist, supports Christ's head. Behind them, a large, golden cross stands against a red background patterned with gold and white crosses. The figures are rendered with halos, indicating their sacred status. The overall composition evokes a sense of sorrow and devotion.",
