    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed male figures stand in a landscape under a blue sky. The figure on the left, dressed in a red robe with gold trim, holds an open book and a large key. The figure on the right, in a blue robe over a green tunic, points with his right hand and holds a sword. Behind them, a stylized, golden, haystack-like form is visible, and in the distance, faint blue architectural forms suggest a city or settlement. The scene is likely a depiction of Saint Peter, identifiable by the key, and another apostle, possibly Saint Paul given the sword, engaged in discussion or teaching.",
