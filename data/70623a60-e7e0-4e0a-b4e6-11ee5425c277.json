    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, bearing stigmata on his hands and side, standing with a processional cross. He is surrounded by three figures. Two kneeling figures in elaborate armor and blue robes are looking up at Christ. A third figure, standing and also armored, holds a spear and looks towards Christ. In the background, a rocky landscape with some vegetation is visible, and beyond that, a city with towers and spires. The overall impression is one of reverence and perhaps a moment of revelation or judgment.",
