    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a presentation of a child, likely the Christ Child, to a group of figures within an arched architectural setting. On the left, a woman in a blue mantle holds the infant. To her right stands a bald-headed figure in a brown robe and blue collar, and to the right of that figure, a woman wearing a crown and a pink dress. The background features red drapery and an opening revealing a green landscape. The overall composition suggests a religious event, possibly the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, or a similar devotional scene involving the Holy Family and other figures.",
