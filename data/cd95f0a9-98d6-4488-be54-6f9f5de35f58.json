    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a simple wooden stable structure, open to a landscape. The Virgin Mary, in a blue robe and pink undergarment, stands with a halo, her hands clasped. Beside her, Saint Joseph, in a dark robe with a pink mantle, kneels. The Christ Child lies naked on the green ground, also with a halo. Rays of light descend from the upper part of the stable, suggesting divine intervention. The background shows a rolling landscape with trees and a distant body of water under a blue sky with stylized clouds.",
