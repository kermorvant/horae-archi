    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a fantastical hunt within a lush, green landscape. A fearsome, lion-like creature with a mane of leaves and a wide, toothy grin is pierced by an arrow. Facing it, a figure in ornate patterned clothing draws a bow, aiming another arrow. Above and behind this hunter, a woman in a patterned robe holds a baby, while another woman stands beside her, pointing. The background features stylized foliage and a starry, celestial motif. The overall composition is framed by an architectural arch.",
