    "scene_description_enriched": "A female figure with a halo kneels in prayer, holding a cross. She has long, wavy hair and wears a simple robe and mantle. To her left, a lion-like creature with a human-like face rests, its paw near its mouth. To her right, a serpentine creature coils upwards. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arch with decorative tracery, set against a dotted background. This imagery likely depicts a saint, possibly Saint Margaret of Antioch, known for her triumph over a dragon, or Saint Jerome in the wilderness, though the presence of the cross and halo points more towards a female saint.",
