    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man with long hair, dressed in a blue tunic and a red cloak, sits outdoors with his legs crossed. He is looking upwards and holding a small object in his right hand. To his left, a shoe lies on the ground. In the upper right portion of the image, a blue, monstrous figure with a beard and flowing hair emerges from a dark, rocky landscape, reaching out towards the man. The background consists of stylized trees and foliage, suggesting a natural setting. This scene likely depicts David in the wilderness, possibly during his persecution by Saul, or a moment of divine inspiration or confrontation.",
