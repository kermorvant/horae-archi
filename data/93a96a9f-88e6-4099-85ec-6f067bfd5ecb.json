    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her halo, seated and engaged in weaving. She wears a blue robe over a pink and gold patterned skirt. Before her is a loom with colorful threads. To her left, a table holds a jug and a loaf of bread. A young Christ Child, also with a halo, stands before the loom, reaching upwards towards his mother with outstretched hands. The figures are situated within an architectural setting that suggests an interior space, possibly a domestic room or workshop, with arched openings revealing glimpses of the outside. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern. The overall scene likely represents a moment of domestic life and the early education or interaction between the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child.",
