    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures are depicted in a landscape. On the left, a person in a yellow robe and a red cap stands with hands outstretched. In the center, a figure in a blue tunic and red hose gestures with open hands, their face turned towards the figure on the left. On the right, another person in a yellow robe and red cap stands with hands clasped. The background features rolling green hills dotted with trees, and in the distance, faint outlines of buildings and ruins are visible. The scene appears to be a narrative depiction of an interaction between these individuals.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene is likely a depiction of a biblical or devotional narrative, possibly illustrating a moment of discourse or encounter between religious figures. Without specific iconographic cues, a precise interpretation is difficult, but the presence of figures in monastic-like robes suggests a religious context.",
