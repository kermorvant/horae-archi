    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his body pale and marked by wounds. Below the cross, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, kneels in sorrow, her head bowed. To her left, a figure in a red robe, likely Saint John the Evangelist, stands with his hand on Mary's shoulder, offering comfort. The background is a rich red tapestry adorned with swirling gold patterns, suggesting a divine or symbolic setting rather than a literal landscape. The ground beneath is depicted as green and undulating, possibly representing the earth or the sea.",
