    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two women in conversation, framed by an arched architectural element. The woman on the left, dressed in a dark gown and a white headdress, appears younger and is looking downwards. The woman on the right is older, cloaked in dark fabric, and her face is partially obscured by her veil. Behind them, a richly patterned tapestry hangs, and through an opening or window, a landscape with buildings and a church spire is visible. The overall impression is one of a private, perhaps intimate, discussion.",
