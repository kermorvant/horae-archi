    "scene_description_enriched": "A procession is depicted entering a fortified complex. On the left, a figure in papal regalia, likely a bishop or pope, is greeted by a crowned woman seated on the ground. The bishop, wearing a mitre and ornate cope, extends his gloved hands towards the seated woman. Behind the bishop, several figures in red hoods and white robes follow. The seated woman, adorned with a crown and halo, wears a blue gown and a pink mantle. She is surrounded by a group of women, many with halos, some praying. The architectural setting includes a large stone building with a prominent arched entrance, towers with conical roofs, and crenellations. In the background, rolling hills are dotted with more fortified structures and a distant castle on a hilltop. The sky is blue with scattered clouds and gold flecks, suggesting a divine or celestial presence.",
