The hands are positioned in a gesture of speech or explanation, with the right hand slightly raised and the left hand holding the drapery. The background is a stylized landscape with green hills and a bright blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figure's attire and halo indicate a saintly or holy person.",
