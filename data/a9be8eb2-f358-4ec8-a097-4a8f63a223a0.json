    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a chaotic battle with numerous soldiers clad in dark armor, some bearing shields and spears. The ground is littered with fallen figures and bloodstains, indicating intense combat. In the background, a dense forest with tall, slender trees stands to the left, while a green, cultivated field stretches to the right. A banner with the inscription \"EOM\" flutters from a pole, and another flag is visible on the right side of the image. The overall impression is one of a violent conflict unfolding in a rural landscape.",
