    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely King David, kneels in prayer before an altar. He wears a crown and a richly decorated robe, with blue sleeves and a red outer garment trimmed with ermine. His hands are clasped in supplication, and his gaze is directed upwards towards a divine light emanating from a blue window. On the altar are the Tablets of the Law, represented as two golden tablets, and a blue, conical object, possibly a liturgical headdress or a symbolic representation. The scene takes place within an interior space with ornate architectural details, including decorative panels on the walls and a red canopy suspended from the ceiling. To the right, a golden harp, an attribute of King David, is visible.",
