    "scene_description_enriched": "A central, imposing sword with a golden hilt, featuring stylized faces, is depicted against a deep blue, star-speckled background with swirling white clouds. Yellow ribbons, inscribed with Latin text, loop and curl around the sword and in the upper space. Below the sword, a blue scabbard, also adorned with golden motifs, is shown entwined with a blue ribbon. The overall composition suggests a symbolic or allegorical representation rather than a narrative scene.",
