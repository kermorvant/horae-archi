The figure on the left wears a red mantle over a blue robe and holds a scroll. The figure on the right, dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold patterns, holds an open book. In the background, a fortified castle sits atop a hill under a radiant sun and starry sky. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative floral motifs.",
