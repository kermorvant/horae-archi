    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Deposition of Christ from the cross. Christ's body, pale and lifeless, is being carefully lowered by two men. One man, wearing a blue robe, supports Christ's torso, while another, in a green tunic and brown cloak, holds his legs. The Virgin Mary, draped in a vibrant blue mantle, stands to the left, her head bowed in sorrow. Other figures, likely mourners or disciples, stand behind, their faces turned towards the central event. A figure in an orange robe kneels at the base of the cross, holding a hammer and chisel, possibly preparing to remove the nails. The background features a decorative tapestry-like pattern and a rocky, uneven ground.",
