    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity, with the Virgin Mary kneeling in prayer to the right, her hands clasped. To the left, a figure, likely Saint Joseph, kneels and looks towards the Christ Child. The infant Jesus lies on the ground, radiating a golden halo. A bull and a donkey are present, symbolizing their presence at the manger. Above them, a dove descends, representing the Holy Spirit. The figures are situated within a rustic stable structure with a thatched roof. In the background, rolling hills are dotted with trees, and a fortified castle or town is visible on a distant hill. The entire scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs and gold ornamentation.",
