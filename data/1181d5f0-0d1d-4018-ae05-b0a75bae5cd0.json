    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identified by his mitre and crozier, stands in a richly decorated interior, gesturing with his right hand. He is clad in a blue cope with gold trim over a red garment. Before him, within a circular enclosure, are three young, unclothed figures with hands clasped in prayer. Behind the bishop, a tall, arched window reveals a blue sky. The scene is framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior space.",
