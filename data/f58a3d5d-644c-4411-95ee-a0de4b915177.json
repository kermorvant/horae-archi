    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint John the Evangelist by his traditional symbol of an eagle, sits in a lush green landscape beside a flowing river. He is depicted with a halo, indicating his sainthood, and is shown writing in a book, with a quill in his hand. An eagle stands to his right, looking towards him. The background is a red tapestry with a geometric pattern, and the scene is framed by an ornate border with blue and gold motifs. This imagery represents Saint John the Evangelist in the act of writing his Gospel, with the eagle symbolizing the divine inspiration he received.",
