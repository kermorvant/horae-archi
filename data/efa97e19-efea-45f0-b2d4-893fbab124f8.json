    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of people gathered around a wooden chest with open books on top. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends from above, radiating light. The figures, including a kneeling person in white, are looking upwards with expressions of awe and devotion. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior space with arched windows. The floor is tiled in a green checkered pattern. This scene is interpreted as the Descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Virgin Mary and the Apostles.",
