    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two demonic figures, one larger and in the foreground, with bat-like wings, horns, and a sword, confronting a group of three human figures. The human figures are dressed in medieval attire, with one in a tan robe and the other two in blue robes. They appear to be in distress, with one figure embracing another. The background is a tessellated pattern of red, blue, and gold squares, suggesting a divine or otherworldly setting, with a patch of green ground and some vegetation visible at the bottom left. The larger demon holds a large, white sword, poised as if to strike. The overall impression is one of temptation or spiritual warfare.",
