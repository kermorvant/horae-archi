    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a king or prophet, is depicted in profile, looking upwards. He wears a crown and a richly draped garment. His right hand is raised, with fingers extended in a gesture of speech or blessing. The scene is framed by decorative architectural elements, including what appears to be a column on the right and an ornate border with foliage and circular motifs above. The background is filled with a dense pattern of small circles, suggesting a stylized representation of foliage or perhaps a celestial setting.",
