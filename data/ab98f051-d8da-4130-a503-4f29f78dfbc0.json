    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two clerics in a church interior, standing before a lectern. The cleric on the left wears a blue cope with gold ornamentation over a white alb, and holds a book. The cleric on the right, also in a blue cope and white alb, gestures with his hands. Behind them, a large, ornate blue canopy covers an unseen object, possibly an altar or a tomb. In the background, dark walls are punctuated by tall, arched windows with blue panes. Several figures in black robes are visible in the upper background, suggesting a choir or congregation. The floor is tiled in a checkerboard pattern of red and green squares. The overall setting suggests a liturgical or devotional ceremony within a church.",
