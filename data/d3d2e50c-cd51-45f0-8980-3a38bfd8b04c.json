    "scene_description_enriched": "Within a circular frame, a group of figures are depicted in a tumultuous, rocky landscape. The central figure, a man with a beard, wears a blue robe and a red garment over it. He is looking to the left, with his hands clasped in prayer or supplication. Other figures, some with beards and wearing similar attire, are clustered around him, their faces partially obscured by the rough terrain and the damage to the manuscript. The background is rendered in shades of brown and blue, suggesting earth and sky, with some gold leaf visible, hinting at a divine or celestial presence. The scene appears to be a depiction of suffering or distress, possibly related to a biblical event.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely a depiction of the Lamentation of Christ or a similar moment of sorrow and suffering, possibly the Entombment or the Deposition. The figures' distress and the rocky setting evoke the Passion of Christ. The presence of multiple figures in anguish suggests a communal grief. The gold leaf could symbolize divine presence or the sanctity of the event.",
