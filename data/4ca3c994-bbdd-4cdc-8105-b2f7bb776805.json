    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a figure, likely a saint or prophet, with a long beard and a headdress, holding a staff or scepter. The figure is positioned within an architectural setting suggested by an arched structure above and to the left. The overall style is illustrative and somewhat abstract, with a focus on outline and form rather than detailed rendering. The scene's interpretation is uncertain due to the abstract nature of the illustration, but it could represent a biblical or hagiographic figure.",
