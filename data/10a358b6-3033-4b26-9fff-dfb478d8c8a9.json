The Virgin Mary, with a sorrowful expression, stands behind Christ, attended by another woman. Two other men are present, one on the left holding a cloth, and another on the right assisting with the body. A wooden cross is visible in the background, suggesting the crucifixion has just occurred. The setting is an outdoor landscape with rolling hills under a blue sky.",
