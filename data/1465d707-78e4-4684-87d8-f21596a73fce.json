    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a king kneeling before a bishop who is holding a large key and raising his hand in blessing. The bishop wears a richly decorated blue cope with gold patterns and a papal tiara. Beside the bishop stands another figure in an orange robe and hood, also with hands clasped. To the left, a man in a green tunic and grey robe stands with his hands clasped in prayer, partially obscured by a patterned red wall. The background features an arched architectural element with a blue, star-studded ceiling and a patterned screen behind the bishop. The floor is tiled in a green checkerboard pattern. This scene likely represents a king receiving a blessing or absolution from a high-ranking church official, possibly a pope or cardinal, symbolizing the submission of temporal power to spiritual authority.",
