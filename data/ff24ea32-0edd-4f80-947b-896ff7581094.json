    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures on the left, including a bishop in full regalia, a nun, and two other individuals, seemingly in distress. They are positioned in front of an arched doorway leading into a building. On the right, three skeletal figures, personifications of Death, are advancing. One skeleton is in the foreground, crouched and menacing, while two others are depicted in mid-leap or stride, one reaching towards the group of humans. A small building with a pitched roof and a wall are visible behind the skeletal figures. The overall atmosphere is one of confrontation between the living and the forces of death.",
