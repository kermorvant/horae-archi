    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel, depicted with large wings and a golden halo, stands holding a sword above its head and a balance scale. The scale's left pan contains a globe with blue and yellow markings, while the right pan holds a small, kneeling human figure. The angel wears a white robe and a crown. The background features a rich, patterned tapestry and a blue sky with wispy clouds. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern. This scene likely represents the Last Judgment, where an angel weighs souls, with the globe symbolizing the world and the kneeling figure representing a soul being judged.",
