    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of people are gathered outdoors on a grassy field, looking upwards towards a radiant sun from which rays descend. Most of the figures have their hands raised in prayer or supplication. One figure in the foreground, seen from the back, wears a blue tunic and has their hands clasped above their head. To the left, a figure in a red robe and yellow trim looks up with hands pressed together. Another figure in a yellow robe and white head covering also gazes skyward. The scene is framed by an ornate border with floral motifs and decorative elements.",
