    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a celestial vision. At the top, a bearded figure, likely God the Father, is enthroned amidst a host of winged figures, possibly angels. He wears a tall, conical headdress and a robe, and raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing or authority, holding a staff in his left. Below this divine presence, a multitude of haloed figures are gathered, representing saints or apostles. They are depicted in various poses of contemplation and devotion, some holding books. The background is divided into a dark, starry sky above and a lighter, more abstract realm below, suggesting a heavenly or spiritual setting. Decorative foliage frames the upper portion of the scene.",
