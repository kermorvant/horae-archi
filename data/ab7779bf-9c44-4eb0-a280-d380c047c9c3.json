They are positioned within a walled garden, suggested by a low fence with floral motifs. To the left, an angel kneels, holding a box or reliquary. Above them, two angels are depicted, one holding a banner with golden lettering. In the background, a fortified building with a prominent arched doorway is visible, suggesting a castle or city gate. To the right, another angel kneels, and further back, two figures are seated, one playing a harp. The ground is scattered with flowers and foliage. The overall scene evokes a sense of divine protection and contemplation, possibly within a heavenly or idealized garden setting.",
