    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ, crowned with thorns and bearing wounds, being supported by several figures. Two men are shown holding Christ's body, one from the front and another from behind. A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is shown reaching out to touch Christ's face, her head covered by a veil. Another figure, possibly a disciple or follower, is visible behind Christ, and a man with a beard and hat stands to the right, looking towards Christ. The background features architectural elements that suggest a building, with arched openings and decorative tracery. The overall impression is one of sorrow and lamentation over Christ's suffering.",
