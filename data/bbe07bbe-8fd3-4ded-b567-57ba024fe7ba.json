    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated, crowned male figure, likely God the Father, holding a globe and gesturing with his right hand. Before him, the Virgin Mary kneels, hands clasped in prayer, with a halo indicating her sanctity. Behind her, two smaller figures, a child and a woman, also kneel in prayer. Above and behind Mary, two winged angels are shown, one presenting a crown to her, while another group of angels looks on from a higher register. The architectural setting is elaborate, with ornate structures suggesting a divine or royal court. The overall scene conveys a moment of divine recognition or coronation of the Virgin Mary, possibly alluding to her Assumption or Coronation as Queen of Heaven.",
