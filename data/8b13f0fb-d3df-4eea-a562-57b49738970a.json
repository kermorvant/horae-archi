    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a haloed figure, likely Christ, seated on a throne and writing on a scroll. The figure wears a blue robe and a pink mantle. To the left of the throne, a bull is depicted, symbolizing Saint Luke. The architectural setting appears to be an interior, with ornate golden decorations and what seems to be a wall or partition behind the figure. The overall impression is one of solemnity and divine activity.",
