    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man, likely King David, kneeling in prayer outdoors. He is dressed in a royal red robe with a fur-lined collar and a blue undergarment, his hands clasped in supplication. A golden crown lies on the ground before him. In the background, a rocky landscape features a distant castle on a hill. Above, a divine figure, possibly God the Father, is depicted within a blue, cloud-like halo, radiating golden light. To the right of the kneeling figure, a golden harp stands upright, suggesting a musical or devotional context. The overall setting is a verdant, hilly landscape under a bright blue sky.",
