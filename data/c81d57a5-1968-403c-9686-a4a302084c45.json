    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary enthroned, holding the Christ Child. She is seated on a cushioned dais beneath a golden, tent-like canopy adorned with a sun motif. Two angels flank the Virgin and Child. The angel on the left wears a blue tunic with gold trim and white sleeves, while the angel on the right wears a red tunic with gold trim and white sleeves, holding a chalice. Another figure, possibly a saint or donor, kneels to the right of the angel in red. The background features architectural elements, including arched windows with tracery, suggesting an interior setting. The overall composition evokes a sense of divine presence and reverence.",
