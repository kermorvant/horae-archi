    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an interior space, likely a church or chapel. In the foreground, a kneeling figure in a blue mantle and white robe raises their hands in prayer before an altar covered with a green cloth. On the altar are a book and a chalice. To the left, a figure in a red cloak holds a staff, and another figure in a white robe stands near a cross. Above the altar, a depiction of Christ on the cross is visible, with a figure of Mary at its base. To the right, a figure in a purple robe holds a blue vessel. In the background, a niche contains a small figure, possibly a saint or a representation of the Virgin Mary. The entire scene is framed by an ornamental border with swirling blue and white elements, suggesting water or divine light.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely represents a Mass or a devotional act related to the Crucifixion and the Eucharist. The kneeling figure in prayer, the altar with the book and chalice, and the presence of the cross all point to a liturgical context. The figure of Christ on the cross and Mary at its base directly reference the Passion. The figure holding the blue vessel might be a deacon or priest preparing for or concluding a sacrament, possibly the administration of holy water or wine.",
