    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a stable-like structure. The Virgin Mary, with a halo and a white veil, is shown in prayer, her hands clasped. To her left stands Saint Joseph, also with a halo, wearing a red robe and a distinctive helmet-like head covering. To the right, a newborn Christ Child sits on a bed of straw, his hands resting on his stomach. A cow is visible behind the Virgin Mary. In the background, above a stone wall, two figures, possibly shepherds, are looking down into the scene, one wearing a brown robe and the other a yellow hood. The architectural elements suggest a humble setting, with rough stone walls and wooden beams supporting a thatched roof.",
