    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with long hair and a beard, dressed in a dark robe, raising his right hand as if in blessing or teaching. He stands before a group of three individuals who are seated and appear to be listening intently. The seated figures are a woman with a halo, a younger woman, and a hooded figure. Behind them, a landscape unfolds with a walled city or fortress in the background, featuring towers and domed buildings. The overall setting suggests a narrative or devotional moment taking place outdoors, possibly in a public or semi-public space.",
