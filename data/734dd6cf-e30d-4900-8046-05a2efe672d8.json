    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, likely a saint or cleric, stands in an interior space. He wears a blue robe over a white garment and a golden halo. He holds a red book in his left arm and a staff with a cross-like finial in his right hand. Behind him, a patterned tapestry hangs, and architectural elements suggest a building with columns, arches, and windows. The floor is tiled in a checkered pattern. The scene appears to be a devotional depiction, possibly of a saint in prayer or contemplation.",
