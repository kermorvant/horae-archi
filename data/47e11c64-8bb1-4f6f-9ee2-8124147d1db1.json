She is looking down at the book, which is adorned with gold lettering. Beside her, a younger woman, identified as the Virgin Mary by her halo and blue attire, is also looking at the book, with her hands touching its pages. The background features a dark, patterned wall, suggesting an interior setting. The scene likely depicts the education of the Virgin Mary by her mother, Saint Anne, a common devotional theme.",
