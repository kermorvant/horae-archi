    "scene_description_enriched": "A man, wearing a white tunic, striped hose, and a red cap, is depicted in a dense thicket of bare branches against a vibrant blue sky dotted with gold. He is bent over, seemingly engaged in pruning or gathering branches, with one hand holding a tool and the other gripping a branch. The ground is rendered in earthy tones with hints of straw or dry grass. The scene evokes a sense of labor and the cyclical nature of the seasons, possibly alluding to agricultural work or the gathering of materials.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The image likely represents a scene from the \"Labors of the Months\" calendar, specifically depicting the month of February or March, associated with pruning trees and preparing the land for spring. It can also be interpreted as a general representation of agricultural labor and the connection to the natural world.",
