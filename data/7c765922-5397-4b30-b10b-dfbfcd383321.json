    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures gathered within an interior space, characterized by arched windows with tracery. At the center, a woman in a veil stands with her hands clasped, while a radiant dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers above her within a halo of light. Surrounding her are several other figures, some with halos, suggesting they are saints or apostles. In the foreground, a figure kneels, possibly representing a supplicant or a witness. The architectural setting includes arched windows and a tiled floor, creating a solemn and devotional atmosphere. This scene is interpreted as the Descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Virgin Mary and the Apostles, a pivotal event in Christian theology.",
