    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a single figure, likely a woman, with dark hair and a pale face, looking towards the viewer with a somber expression. She is wearing a dark garment with horizontal bands around the neck and upper chest. Her left arm is extended forward, palm open, while her right arm is bent at the elbow, with her hand holding a dark object, possibly a cup or chalice. The background is predominantly dark, suggesting an interior space, with a hint of architectural structure at the top, possibly a lintel or beam. The overall mood is one of introspection or perhaps sorrow.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The figure's gesture and the object in her hand could allude to various devotional scenes. Without further context or clearer iconography, a definitive interpretation is difficult. However, the gesture of offering or holding a vessel might relate to themes of sacrifice, libation, or receiving divine grace. The somber expression could suggest penitence or contemplation.",
