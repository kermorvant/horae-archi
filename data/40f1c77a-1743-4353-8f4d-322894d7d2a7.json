    "scene_description_enriched": "Two haloed figures, likely saints or religious figures, stand facing forward against a decorative, patterned background. The figure on the left wears a dark robe with white trim and holds a book in their left hand and a cylindrical object, possibly a reliquary or flask, in their right. The figure on the right wears a lighter-colored robe, also with white trim, and holds a book in their left hand. Both figures have serene expressions and are depicted in a stylized manner typical of medieval manuscript illumination. The ground beneath them is rendered with a textured, grassy appearance. The scene is framed by a border, suggesting it is an illustration within a larger work.",
