    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Bathsheba, a nude woman with long red hair, standing in a pool of water surrounded by lush greenery and trees laden with red fruit. Behind her, a multi-story building with classical architectural elements, including columns and decorative friezes, is visible. Within an upper loggia of this building, several figures are observing the scene, including a man wearing a crown and royal attire, and others in various colored garments. In the distance, a castle or fortress is perched on a hill under a blue sky. The inscription above the building appears to be in Latin, possibly referencing David and Bathsheba.",
