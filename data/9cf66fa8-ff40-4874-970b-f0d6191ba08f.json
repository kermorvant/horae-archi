    "scene_description_enriched": "A monstrous, winged demon with fiery wings hovers in the sky, raining down burning arrows and droplets onto a flock of sheep. One man, dressed in a blue tunic and lying on the ground, appears to be struck by the attack. Another man, wearing a fur-lined hat and a brown tunic, stands to the right, looking up at the demon with his hand raised, seemingly in a gesture of awe or supplication. The scene is set in a rocky, hilly landscape with sparse vegetation.",
