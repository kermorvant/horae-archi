    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, his head bowed and body emaciated. A lance pierces his side. Below the cross, a group of mourners are gathered. On the left, several figures in blue and orange robes stand, one of whom is kneeling and reaching towards the cross. On the right, a figure in a blue robe and orange undergarment stands with hands clasped in prayer. The background is a rich, textured red, possibly representing fabric or foliage, with a blue sky and a small boat visible at the top. The ground beneath the figures is rocky and uneven.",
