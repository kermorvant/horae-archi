    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a close-up of an elderly man with a long, flowing beard and mustache. He is wearing a distinctive hat with a plume and a pointed, dangling element. His gaze is directed upwards and to the right, with his mouth slightly open. He is dressed in layered garments, one of which appears to be a cloak or robe with a textured pattern. His left hand is visible, raised and gesturing, possibly in speech or contemplation. The background is a simple hatched pattern, suggesting an indoor or studio setting.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is likely a portrait of a historical or biblical figure, possibly a prophet or a scholar, given the beard and contemplative expression. Without further context or identifying attributes, a specific scene interpretation is not possible. However, the upward gaze and open mouth could suggest a moment of divine inspiration, prayer, or pronouncement.",
