    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts King David kneeling in prayer, his hands clasped and his gaze directed upwards. He is clad in ornate armor and is accompanied by a harp lying on the ground beside him. Behind David, a group of soldiers in armor and helmets stand with banners, suggesting a military context. In the background, a fortified building, possibly a castle or palace, is visible on a hill, surrounded by trees and a stylized landscape. The overall impression is one of devotion and perhaps a moment of reflection or supplication before or after a battle.",
