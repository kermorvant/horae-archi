    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ seated, wearing a crown of thorns and holding a reed. He is surrounded by several figures who are tormenting him. Two figures on either side are striking him with staffs, one of which appears to be a scepter. Another figure to the left raises a hand as if to strike. A figure to the lower left kneels and looks up at Christ. The background is plain, with a large Roman numeral 'I' at the top right, suggesting it is part of a series of illustrations. The overall impression is one of suffering and mockery.",
