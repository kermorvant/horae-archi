He is dressed in a golden tunic with a torn hem and a red cloak draped over his shoulders. He holds an open book in his left hand, upon which rests a lamb bearing a cross. Saint John points with his right index finger towards the lamb, indicating its significance. He has a halo around his head, signifying his sainthood. The scene is rendered with a vibrant palette and detailed brushwork, characteristic of medieval manuscript illumination.",
