    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Saint John the Baptist in a rocky, wooded landscape, seated and holding an open book. He is dressed in a purple tunic and a red cloak lined with gold. His right hand is raised, holding a thin stick or reed, and he looks upwards. To the left, a monstrous, seven-headed beast emerges from the water, its body resembling a lion. In the foreground, two books lie on the ground, and a decorative red border with gold ornamentation runs across the bottom of the image. The overall setting is outdoors, with a body of water and trees visible.",
