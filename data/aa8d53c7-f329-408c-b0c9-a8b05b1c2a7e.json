    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a winged angel blowing a trumpet, with a radiant halo or crown of rays above its head. Below, a group of figures are shown in distress. One figure, possibly a man, is lying down, seemingly ill or injured, with another figure leaning over him. To the right, a man with a beard and a halo, possibly a prophet or saint, raises his hand in supplication or awe, while another figure in the foreground reads from a book. The overall impression is one of divine intervention or judgment, with the trumpet blast signifying a significant event.",
