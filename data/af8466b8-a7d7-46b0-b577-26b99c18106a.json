    "scene_description_enriched": "A male figure, identified as a bishop by his mitre and crozier, stands in a frontal pose. He wears a red chasuble adorned with gold patterns over a white alb and a green dalmatic. His left hand is raised in a gesture of blessing, while his right hand holds a golden crozier. Behind him, a blue tapestry with gold foliate motifs is visible, and beyond that, a grey architectural element. In the background, a distant landscape with buildings and spires can be seen. The scene is framed by a golden arch.",
