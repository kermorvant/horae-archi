To his left stands an eagle, his traditional symbol, carrying a lantern in its beak. The background features a body of water and a distant castle or fortified building under a starry night sky. The figure of John is rendered with a halo, indicating his saintly status, and he is dressed in a blue tunic and a red mantle. The eagle, also with a halo, is depicted with detailed feathers and talons. The overall setting suggests a contemplative or visionary moment for the Evangelist.",
