    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent event unfolding in an urban setting. A woman in a pink dress, wearing a yellow headdress, kneels and cradles a baby. Another baby, wrapped in yellow cloth, is held by a man in a blue tunic and purple cap, who raises a sword as if to strike. To the right, another man in a red tunic, armor, and black hat also holds a sword, poised to attack. A woman in a blue robe stands behind him, her face obscured. Behind the figures, buildings with windows are visible, suggesting a street or courtyard. The overall impression is one of brutality and tragedy, likely representing the Massacre of the Innocents.",
