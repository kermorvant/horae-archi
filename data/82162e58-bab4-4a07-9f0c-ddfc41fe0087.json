    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Baptism of Christ. John the Baptist, clad in a dark, rough garment and a white sash, stands on the right bank of a body of water, pouring water from a shell onto the head of Christ. Christ, depicted as a nude youth with a golden halo, stands in the water, which is rendered with green wavy lines. To the left, two figures with golden halos are present: one, an angel with large white wings, wears a blue robe, and the other, possibly a disciple or another angel, wears a red robe and holds a white cloth. The background features a blue sky with stylized trees and rocky terrain. The overall composition suggests a natural setting for this significant religious event.",
