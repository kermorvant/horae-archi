    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, wearing a conical hat with a brim and a tunic, stands within an architectural setting. He holds a quill in his right hand, poised over what appears to be a book or scroll. The architectural elements suggest an interior space, with a decorative arch above and a column to the left. The style is reminiscent of early woodcuts or manuscript illuminations.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely depicts a scribe or scholar at work, possibly engaged in the act of writing or illuminating a manuscript. Given the context of Books of Hours, this could represent a figure associated with the creation or study of religious texts, or perhaps a depiction of a saint known for their learning or writing.",
