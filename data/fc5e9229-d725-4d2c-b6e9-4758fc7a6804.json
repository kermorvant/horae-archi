    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and headdress, rides a donkey, cradling the Christ Child. The Christ Child, with a golden halo, is held close by his mother. Beside them, an elderly man, likely Saint Joseph, walks and guides the donkey by its reins. He wears a pink tunic and an orange cap. The figures are set against a backdrop of a green, hilly landscape with stylized trees and a rocky outcrop. The ground beneath them is a pale, textured surface, suggesting a path or road. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
