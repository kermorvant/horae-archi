    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a funeral or lying-in-state of a bishop, who is shown reclined in a richly decorated sarcophagus. He wears episcopal vestments, including a mitre and a blue robe adorned with gold. A halo surrounds his head, indicating his sanctity. Around the sarcophagus, a group of clerics and laypeople are gathered, some in prayer, others holding books or liturgical objects. One cleric, dressed in red and wearing a mitre, appears to be officiating or presiding over the ceremony. Behind the figures, an elaborate architectural setting is visible, featuring arches, columns, and a domed ceiling, suggesting the interior of a church or cathedral. Above this, a cityscape with buildings and towers is depicted against a gold background, possibly representing the heavenly Jerusalem or a symbolic representation of the church's grandeur.",
