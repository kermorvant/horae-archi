    "scene_description_enriched": "The image displays a heraldic shield with a vertical hatching pattern. Centered within the shield are three pointed objects, resembling spears or lances. One is positioned vertically, and the other two are crossed diagonally behind it. The objects have sharp points and some detailing at their bases. The overall impression is that of a coat of arms, likely representing a family, order, or a specific symbolic meaning.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is a heraldic emblem. Without further context, a specific religious or biblical interpretation is not possible. However, the crossed spears could symbolize martyrdom, military prowess, or a specific saint associated with such weaponry (e.g., Saint George or Saint Michael). The hatching pattern on the shield is a common heraldic technique for indicating color (in this case, likely gules or red).",
