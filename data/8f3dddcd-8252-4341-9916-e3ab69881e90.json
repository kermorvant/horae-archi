    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary seated on a throne, holding the Christ Child. She is dressed in a blue mantle over a pink gown, and the Christ Child is nude. Surrounding them are several small, red, winged figures, possibly representing cherubim or demons, and above them, a group of blue and pink winged figures, likely angels, are depicted with scrolls. To the right, a man in a red, gold-patterned tunic and red hose kneels in prayer, his hands clasped. The background is a rich gold, textured with a diamond pattern. The figures are positioned in a garden setting with lush green foliage and small flowers. The throne is elaborate, with architectural details suggesting a Gothic style, and a crescent moon is visible beneath it.",
