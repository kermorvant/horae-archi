    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the martyrdom of Saint Stephen. A central figure, presumably Saint Stephen, kneels with his hands raised in supplication and his head tilted back, showing wounds and blood. He is dressed in a golden robe over a white garment. Two men stand over him, one on the left in a red tunic and blue leggings, holding a stone aloft, and another on the right in a blue tunic and grey leggings, also holding a stone. The background is a green landscape with a blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The figures are rendered in a stylized, medieval manner, with emphasis on their actions and emotional expressions.",
