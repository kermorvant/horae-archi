    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of men are gathered, with one seated figure in blue and gold robes pointing towards a kneeling figure who is presenting a golden object. Behind the kneeling figure, several other men stand, observing the scene. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting characterized by pointed arches and decorative elements, with a red curtain forming the backdrop. Above this structure, buildings with tiled roofs and towers are visible against a blue, cloud-filled sky. The floor is decorated with a geometric pattern of green and black triangles. This scene likely depicts a moment of presentation or judgment, possibly related to a biblical narrative or a historical event.",
