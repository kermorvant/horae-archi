    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on a journey, likely the Flight into Egypt or the Nativity procession. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe adorned with gold, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child swaddled in white. Saint Joseph, wearing a red hood and tunic, walks beside them, leading the donkey. The background features a hilly landscape with trees and a distant walled town or castle. Golden rays emanate from the upper sky, suggesting divine presence or a celestial event.",
