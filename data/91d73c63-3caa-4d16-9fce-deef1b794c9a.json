    "scene_description_enriched": "A woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is depicted kneeling in prayer. She is wearing a blue mantle and a white veil, with her hands clasped together. She is positioned in an architectural setting that appears to be a room with a bed. The room has stone walls, a tiled floor, and windows with tracery. An ornate bed with a golden headboard is visible. The scene is framed by an architectural element resembling an arcade with a column and arches, and the entire composition is surrounded by a decorative border with floral motifs.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene is likely an \"Annunciation\" or a \"Visitation\" or a \"Nativity\" scene, depicting the Virgin Mary in prayer, possibly awaiting or reflecting on a divine event. The presence of the bed could suggest a domestic setting or a scene related to childbirth or rest.",
