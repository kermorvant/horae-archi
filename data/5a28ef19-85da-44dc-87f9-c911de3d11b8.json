    "scene_description_enriched": "A disembodied hand, appearing pale and with visible veins, emerges from a dark, amorphous mass. The hand is pierced by a wound from which red blood drips. The background is a vibrant red, adorned with swirling gold lines that suggest movement or divine light. The entire scene is framed by a blue border with white wave-like patterns. This imagery likely represents the Wounds of Christ, specifically the wound in his hand, symbolizing his sacrifice and suffering.",
