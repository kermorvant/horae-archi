    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Virgin Mary, adorned in a blue mantle with gold embellishments and a white veil, seated with a golden halo. To her left stands an angel, also with a golden halo, wearing a white robe and holding a small, round object. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting suggested by a wooden structure in the foreground and a dark, possibly interior, background with hints of an archway. The overall impression is one of a sacred or devotional moment, likely the Annunciation, given the presence of the angel and the Virgin Mary.",
