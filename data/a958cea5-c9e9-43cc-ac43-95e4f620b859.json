    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. The Virgin Mary, in a blue mantle adorned with gold, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before the Christ Child, who lies in a manger radiating golden light. To the right, Saint Joseph, in a red robe and blue cloak, holds a candle. Behind them, two figures, possibly shepherds, are visible in the background, looking towards the child. To the left, a horse and an ox are partially visible, suggesting the stable setting. The architectural elements are minimal, with a suggestion of a wooden structure or stable wall.",
