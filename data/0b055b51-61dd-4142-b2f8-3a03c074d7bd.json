    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ, with the Virgin Mary cradling the body of Jesus in her lap. To the left, a woman in a red robe and green garment supports Christ's torso. To the right, another woman in a yellow robe gently touches Christ's feet, which are positioned over a golden chalice. In the background, a rocky mound with a ladder suggests the site of the crucifixion. Further in the distance, faint architectural ruins are visible, hinting at a landscape setting. The overall composition conveys a profound sense of sorrow and devotion.",
