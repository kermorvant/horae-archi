    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel descends from a starry blue sky, radiating golden light, holding a scroll with the inscription \"Gloria in excelsis Deo et terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.\" Below, a woman in a pink gown kneels with her hands clasped to her chest, looking upwards. Beside her, a shepherd in a blue tunic and black hose stands holding a staff, with a dog at his feet. A flock of sheep is gathered behind the woman. The background depicts a rocky landscape with trees and distant buildings, including what appears to be a windmill and a fortified structure.",
