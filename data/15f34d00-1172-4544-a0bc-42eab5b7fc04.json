    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts three figures in a grassy, hilly landscape under a blue sky. On the left, an older man with grey hair, wearing a striped tunic and red hose, plays bagpipes. In the center, a child in a reddish-brown tunic kneels with hands outstretched. To the right, a person in a dark hooded robe kneels with hands clasped in prayer, looking upwards. Rays of golden light descend from the sky, illuminating the scene. A small brown dog lies in the foreground. In the background, a rocky outcrop with a hint of a structure is visible on the left, and distant buildings are suggested on the right. The scene is framed by an arched border decorated with floral motifs.",
