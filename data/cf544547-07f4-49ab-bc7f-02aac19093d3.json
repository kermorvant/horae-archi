    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a regal figure, likely a king, seated on a throne and holding a golden orb. He is gesturing with a green frond towards a kneeling figure, presumably the Virgin Mary, who is crowned and praying with clasped hands. Above the Virgin Mary, a haloed child, likely the Christ Child, is depicted, also with a halo. The figures are set against a backdrop of blue sky with scattered golden motifs, framed by architectural elements that suggest a canopy or tent-like structure with red, patterned drapery. The overall impression is one of a divine or royal audience.",
