    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, with a halo, rides a donkey, holding the Christ Child swaddled in red. Joseph, with a red turban and beard, walks beside the donkey, holding its reins and a staff from which a white cloth hangs. They are in an outdoor landscape with rolling hills, trees, and rocky outcrops. In the background, a classical column stands on a hill, with a figure of a demon or pagan deity leaping from it, symbolizing the fall of paganism. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
