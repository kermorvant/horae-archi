    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Noah's Ark, with a large, wooden vessel dominating the composition. A white sail is unfurled, and a mast rises from the deck. Two figures, presumably Noah and his wife, are visible inside the ark, tending to animals. A ramp extends from the ark to the shore, where various animals, including horses, sheep, deer, rabbits, a porcupine, and a peacock, are either boarding or gathered. A dragon flies in the sky above the ark, and a sun with a radiant halo shines. The setting is a body of water with a green, grassy landscape on the left, populated by more animals. The entire scene is framed by an arched border adorned with floral motifs and gold leaf.",
