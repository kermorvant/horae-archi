    "scene_description_enriched": "Three figures, each with a halo and large blue wings, are seated on a wooden throne-like structure. The central figure, appearing to be Christ, holds a cross in his left hand and raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing. The figures on either side also raise a hand in blessing and hold a golden orb in their laps. The background is a richly decorated wooden architectural element, possibly a screen or reredos, with fluted details and vertical panels. The scene is framed by a decorative border with floral motifs.",
