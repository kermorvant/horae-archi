    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space. On the left, the Angel Gabriel, with large wings and dressed in a white robe, kneels and presents a scroll inscribed with Latin text. Facing him on the right, the Virgin Mary, adorned in a pink dress and a blue mantle, kneels before a wooden lectern. She has a halo and her hand is raised in a gesture of surprise or acceptance. The room features a checkered floor of blue and white tiles, a wooden ceiling, and large windows that reveal a glimpse of trees and sky outside. The architecture is simple, suggesting a domestic setting.",
