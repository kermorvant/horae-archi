    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity. On the left, Christ is shown with his wounds from the crucifixion visible on his torso and hand, draped in a blue cloak lined with red. He has long, reddish-brown hair and a beard. To his right, God the Father, depicted with a long grey beard and hair, wears a blue robe and holds a globe topped with a cross. He is shown with his hand raised in a gesture of blessing or teaching. Above them, a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers with outstretched wings, surrounded by golden rays emanating from a yellow background. The figures are rendered in a stylized, frontal manner, typical of medieval manuscript illumination.",
