    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely a saint or bishop, stands in a frontal pose, holding a red book. The figure is dressed in liturgical vestments, including a pink chasuble with gold trim and a white alb. The background is a rich red tapestry with a repeating gold diamond pattern. The figure's feet rest on a green ground, suggesting an outdoor setting or a stylized representation of the earth. The overall impression is one of solemnity and devotion, typical of religious manuscript illumination.",
