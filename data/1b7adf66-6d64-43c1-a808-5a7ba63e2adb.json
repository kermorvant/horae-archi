    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Visitation, with the Virgin Mary, identifiable by her blue robe and halo, gently touching her abdomen. She is accompanied by Saint Elizabeth, who is older, wears a yellow and pink robe, and is also pregnant, indicated by her hand on her belly. They are in an interior space with a large window showing a castle in the distance. To the right, a fireplace with a mantelpiece and decorative elements is visible, along with a wooden lectern holding an open book with musical notation. The floor is tiled in a geometric pattern. The overall impression is one of quiet intimacy and shared anticipation.",
