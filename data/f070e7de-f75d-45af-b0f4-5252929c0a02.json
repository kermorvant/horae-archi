    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. The Virgin Mary, holding the Christ Child, stands before an altar. To her right, a bearded man, likely Simeon, reaches out towards the child. Behind Simeon, another bearded man, possibly Joseph, observes. To the left of the Virgin, a woman holds a basket and a staff. The background is a red textile with a gold grid pattern. Above the altar, a bell hangs suspended. The altar itself is draped with a patterned cloth and has a wooden structure beneath it. The overall setting suggests an interior space within a religious building.",
