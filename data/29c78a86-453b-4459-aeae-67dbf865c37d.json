    "scene_description_enriched": "The upper register depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, with Eve taking fruit from the serpent-entwined tree and Adam reaching for it, while an angel with a sword expels them from the garden. The lower register illustrates the Annunciation, with the Angel Gabriel presenting a scroll to the Virgin Mary, who is shown in prayer. A plant in a vase stands between them, and a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, hovers above Mary. Both scenes are set against a gold background, suggesting a divine or sacred context.",
