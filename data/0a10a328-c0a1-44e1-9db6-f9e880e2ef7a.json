The figures are dressed in flowing robes of red, green, and pink. One figure in a blue robe, also haloed, walks in front of the ark, holding a book. The background is a simple blue sky with a hint of green landscape at the bottom. The entire scene is contained within a circular frame, surrounded by decorative floral motifs.",
