    "scene_description_enriched": "In a verdant landscape, a group of men in blue and red hats gather around a central figure who is placing a crown on the head of a kneeling woman. The man placing the crown wears a golden robe and has a long beard. The kneeling woman, also in a golden-hued robe, has her hands clasped in prayer. Above them, in a celestial blue sky with golden accents, a bearded figure, possibly divine, is depicted with hands clasped. In the background, a castle with multiple spires sits atop a green hill. The scene is framed by an ornate golden border.",
