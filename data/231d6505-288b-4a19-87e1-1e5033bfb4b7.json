    "scene_description_enriched": "A single sheep stands in a grassy field under a dark blue sky with scattered clouds. The sheep is depicted in profile, facing left, with its head lowered as if grazing. In the background, a stylized tree with bare branches, rendered in gold and dark brown, stands against the sky. The scene is enclosed within a circular frame, with decorative elements visible at the top and right edges of the image, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript. The overall impression is one of a pastoral landscape, possibly representing a simple, natural setting.",
