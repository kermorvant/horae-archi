    "scene_description_enriched": "An angel with vibrant orange wings descends from a blue sky, gesturing towards a scene unfolding in a pastoral landscape. Below, three figures are engaged in a struggle. One figure, wearing a blue tunic and an orange collar, wields a long staff and appears to be defending against another figure dressed in a purple tunic and green head covering, who is also holding a staff. A brown dog sits in the foreground, leashed to the purple-clad figure. In the background, a flock of sheep grazes on a green field, and distant buildings with red roofs are visible on a hill. A scroll with Latin text floats in the sky near the angel.",
