    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross, wearing a crown of thorns and a loincloth, his body bleeding. To the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue mantle and veil, stands with her hands clasped in prayer and a halo behind her head. To the right, a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, dressed in a red robe over a blue tunic, looks towards the cross with an outstretched hand. The background features rocky terrain and a blue sky. The scene is framed by decorative architectural elements on the sides, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
