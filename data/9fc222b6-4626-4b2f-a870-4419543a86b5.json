    "scene_description_enriched": "A group of figures stands on a green ground, framed by decorative borders. In the center, a bishop, identified by his mitre and blue cope, holds an open book and a cross. To his left, a tonsured monk in a brown habit holds a chalice. To the bishop's right, a knight in full armor, adorned with a blue surcoat bearing a red cross, stands with a sword. Behind them, several other figures with halos are visible, some in red robes and others in monastic attire. The scene appears to be an outdoor gathering, possibly a religious ceremony or a depiction of saints and donors.",
