    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed man, likely a saint, is seated in a richly decorated bedchamber, facing a lectern with an open book. He wears a simple grey robe and a wide-brimmed hat. To his right, a lion sits attentively. The room features ornate red and gold drapery behind the bed, and a large window with vertical bars. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern. The scene likely depicts a saint in contemplation or study, possibly St. Jerome, given the presence of the lion, a common attribute.",
