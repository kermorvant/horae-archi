    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a single foot, rendered in a pale, almost white tone, emerging from a green, leafy plant. The foot shows toes and an ankle, and on the instep, there is a visible wound depicted as a red stain. The background is a rich red oval, adorned with a repeating pattern of small, stylized gold leaves and circular motifs. This oval is bordered by a blue band with a wavy, cloud-like pattern. The overall composition is symbolic and abstract, lacking any specific architectural or landscape elements.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The wounded foot, particularly with the red mark, strongly suggests the Passion of Christ, specifically referencing the wounds from the crucifixion. The plant emerging from the foot could symbolize resurrection or new life, a common theme in Christian iconography. The stylized background and lack of setting point towards a devotional or allegorical representation rather than a narrative scene.",
