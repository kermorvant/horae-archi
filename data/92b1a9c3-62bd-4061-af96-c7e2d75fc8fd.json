Two winged seraphim with red wings are positioned above, and two golden-winged angels flank the scene. The figures are set against a blue background with golden stars, and a patterned red textile hangs behind them. God the Father is seated on a golden throne-like structure, and Christ is on a wooden cross. The overall composition is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
