    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a man with a beard, dressed in a blue robe, kneeling in prayer on a grassy bank beside a body of water. His hands are clasped in front of him, and he looks upwards. In the background, across the water, a town with several buildings, including a church with a spire, is visible. Further in the distance, a rocky, golden formation rises from the water. Above the town and landscape, in a celestial realm depicted with a blue sky and clouds, a figure, likely Christ, is seated, also with a halo and looking downwards. The overall scene is framed by an ornate, gilded arch.",
