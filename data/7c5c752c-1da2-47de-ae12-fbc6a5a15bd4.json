    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary seated and reading a book, while the Angel Gabriel kneels before her, holding a scroll. The figures are positioned within an architectural setting that suggests a domestic interior or a loggia. The Virgin Mary is dressed in a blue mantle and wears a halo, as does the Angel Gabriel, who is adorned with white robes and wings. Behind the Virgin Mary is a bed with green and gold patterned hangings. The background features a red tapestry with a floral motif and a scroll with Latin text. Above the figures, an arcade with pointed arches and decorative vaulting is visible, leading to a glimpse of the sky with celestial figures. To the left, a Gothic tower with spires is depicted, and to the right, a window with tracery is present.",
