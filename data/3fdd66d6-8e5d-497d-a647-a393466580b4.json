    "scene_description_enriched": "This is a decorative border featuring grotesque figures and foliage. On the left, a figure with a hooded head and a beard is depicted. Next to it, a stylized leafy motif. In the center, a grotesque face with large ears and an open mouth, wearing a hood. To its right, a hand points outwards, and further right, another grotesque creature or mask is visible, with circular elements suggesting eyes or decorative motifs. The overall impression is one of decorative ornamentation rather than a narrative scene.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This image is a decorative border, likely from a medieval manuscript or printed book. It does not depict a specific religious or biblical scene, but rather uses grotesque imagery, which was common in medieval art for decorative purposes, sometimes to ward off evil or simply for visual interest. The figures are not identifiable as specific persons from religious texts.",
