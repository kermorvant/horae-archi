    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed male figure, likely Christ, stands holding a large wooden cross in his left arm and a book open in his right hand. He wears a blue tunic with gold stripes and a red mantle. His hair is long and light brown, and he has a beard. A shadow of a cross is cast behind him. The figure is positioned against a plain background with a hint of architectural structure suggested by the shadow. The presence of the cross and the book strongly suggests a depiction related to Christ's Passion and teachings.",
