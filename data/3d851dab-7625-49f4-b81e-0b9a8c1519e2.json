    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a solemn gathering around a bed. On the left, a figure in a red cloak, with head tilted back and eyes looking upwards, appears to be in a state of spiritual rapture or supplication. Beside this figure, another person in blue and a headdress, possibly a cleric or a mourner, looks on. Behind them, partially obscured, is another figure. To the right, three figures cloaked in black, with hoods obscuring their faces, stand solemnly, suggesting a somber or mourning context. The bed itself is draped with a pink sheet and a green patterned cloth, and two ornate candle holders with tall, slender spikes stand on either side of it. The floor is tiled with a geometric pattern of diamonds. The background features a rich, textured red fabric with gold ornamentation.",
