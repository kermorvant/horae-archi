    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a central, circular altar or brazier with flames erupting from its top. This central structure is supported by a white, cylindrical base decorated with vertical fluting. Above the base, a golden, open-sided canopy is supported by slender columns. The canopy has a decorative, crenellated edge. Flanking the central structure are two smaller, basket-like containers, also filled with flames. The background is black and speckled with small, dark dots, suggesting a night sky or a void. The entire composition is framed within a circular border with a gold, scalloped edge, set against a red background.",
