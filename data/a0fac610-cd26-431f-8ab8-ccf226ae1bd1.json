    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, depicted with a blue mantle over a red garment, tenderly holds the Christ Child. The Child, nude and with a serene expression, rests in her arms. Behind them, an architectural element suggests an interior space, possibly a niche or a vaulted ceiling with decorative ribs. The scene is framed by a border, and in the upper right corner, a gilded initial with a floral motif is visible. The overall impression is one of maternal devotion and sacred intimacy.",
