Three figures are present: two mourners in dark robes stand to the left, facing a coffin containing a body draped in white. To the right, a priest in a red robe and a white alb holds an open book and a sprinkler, while another figure in a blue robe holds a censer. The scene is set against a backdrop of a brick wall and a blue sky with golden stars, suggesting a stylized or symbolic representation of the afterlife or a sacred space. The ground is green with stylized yellow vegetation.",
