    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a meal setting with three men seated at a table and a woman kneeling below. The central figure, identified as Christ by his halo, wears a purple robe adorned with gold. To his left, a man in a red tunic points forward, while to his right, a man in a blue cap and tunic also points. The table is covered with a white cloth patterned with diamonds, and on it are plates, bread, and a knife. Below the table, a woman with long auburn hair, dressed in blue and gold, is shown tending to her hair, possibly anointing it. The background suggests an interior space with architectural elements like a patterned wall and a draped ceiling.",
