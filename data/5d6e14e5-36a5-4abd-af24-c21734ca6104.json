    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a kneeling figure with a halo, hands clasped in prayer, wearing a brown robe over blue garments. A serpent is coiled around the figure's waist. To the right, a golden stag stands, with a small figure of Christ on the cross appearing to emerge from its antlers. The background is a landscape with green fields and a blue sky. The entire scene is framed by decorative architectural elements on the left and right, suggesting it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
