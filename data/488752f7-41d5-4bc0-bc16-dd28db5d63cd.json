    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation, with the Virgin Mary on the left, dressed in blue and white, kneeling before an open book. Behind her is a red, ornate curtain. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, with wings and a golden halo, holds a lily and a scroll. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, flies between them. Above the angel, through an arched opening, God the Father is depicted in a heavenly realm with clouds and a cross. The figures are framed by architectural elements suggesting an interior space, possibly a room or a chapel, with decorative columns and arches.",
