    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a ram standing in a natural setting, surrounded by foliage. The ram is rendered in a stylized manner, with textured wool and prominent, curved horns. The background is filled with a dense pattern of dots, suggesting a textured or starry sky, and is framed by an arched border with decorative elements at the corners. The scene is enclosed within a rectangular frame, suggesting it is an illustration within a larger work.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The ram is a common symbol in Christian iconography, often representing Christ as the Lamb of God (Agnus Dei), who sacrifices himself for humanity's sins. It can also symbolize innocence, purity, and sacrifice. In a broader sense, it can represent the zodiac sign Aries, or simply be an element of naturalistic decoration.",
