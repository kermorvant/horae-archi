    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a nude woman with long blonde hair bathing in a decorative tub, from which water flows from a lion-headed spout. She is partially submerged in the water, with her hands resting on the edge of the tub. Behind her, a wooden fence encloses a garden with green grass and small plants. In the background, a group of richly dressed figures stand on a bridge with arches, observing the scene. One figure, an older man with a long white beard, wears a blue robe and a crown-like hat. The overall setting suggests a royal or noble garden with architectural elements like a bridge and a fountain.",
