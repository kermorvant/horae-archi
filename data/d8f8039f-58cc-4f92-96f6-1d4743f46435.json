    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two shepherds in a pastoral landscape. One shepherd, seated on the ground with a blue hood and red tunic, holds a staff. The other shepherd stands, wearing a green cloak over a red tunic and blue hose, with his arms crossed. A flock of sheep rests nearby, and a dog lies attentively beside a small barrel. In the background, rolling hills are dotted with trees, and a body of water is visible. On distant hills, fortified castles with towers and battlements are depicted. Above, a blue angel with wings outstretched hovers within a radiant, orange halo, suggesting a divine presence or message.",
