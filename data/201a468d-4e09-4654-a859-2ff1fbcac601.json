    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures seated on a richly decorated red carpet. On the left, a crowned woman, likely the Virgin Mary, is shown with her hands clasped in prayer, her head bowed. She wears a blue gown beneath a white mantle. On the right, a bearded man, presumably Christ, is seated, holding a golden orb topped with a cross. He is dressed in a white robe and raises his right hand in a gesture of blessing or speech. Behind them, a red tapestry with gold ornamentation serves as a backdrop. To the far left and right, architectural elements suggest a grand setting, with columns and what appear to be seraphim or winged figures in the upper corners, rendered in red and gold.",
