    "scene_description_enriched": "A haloed figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, is depicted seated outdoors, writing on a scroll. The figure is dressed in a dark robe and cloak, with long hair. To the right, a large bird, possibly an eagle, is shown with its beak near the scroll, perhaps dictating or inspiring the writing. In the background, a stylized landscape features rolling hills, trees, and a distant town with buildings and spires. Rays of light emanate from above, suggesting divine inspiration.",
