    "scene_description_enriched": "The Virgin Mary, crowned and draped in a blue mantle over a grey gown, holds the Christ Child. The child, depicted with a halo, is unclothed and appears to be looking to the side. Behind them, a dark, vertical background suggests an architectural setting, possibly the interior of a building, with fluted pilasters visible on either side. The scene is framed by a decorative border with musical notes and foliage, typical of a Book of Hours.",
