    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man wearing a blue cloak over a pink robe and a blue hat, holding a large key and a pouch, stands next to a younger figure in a brown tunic. The man gestures towards an open wooden door, which leads to a building with crenellated walls and multiple pointed roofs, some topped with spires. The background is a red tapestry with gold patterns. The scene appears to depict a figure of authority granting access or entering a fortified structure.",
    "scene_interpretation": "This scene likely represents a biblical or historical event where a figure of authority, possibly a king or a patriarch, is entering or granting entry to a significant location, symbolized by the fortified building and the key. Without further context, a specific interpretation is difficult, but it evokes themes of stewardship, power, or divine access.",
