    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in what appears to be a courtyard or an open hall. On the left, a procession of individuals, some wearing helmets, are being led. One figure in the center, seated on a raised platform with steps, wears a blue tunic and an orange cloak lined with white fur, holding a small object. To the right, a man in green hose and a white shirt is tethered to a post. Further right, a nearly nude figure stands, and another man in orange trousers and a brown tunic raises a stick as if to strike him. The architectural elements suggest a partially enclosed space with columns and arches.",
