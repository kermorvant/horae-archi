    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two large, stylized fish swimming in a blue expanse, possibly representing water. Above them, a landscape unfolds with rolling hills, some topped with structures that resemble buildings or fortifications. A bright, radiating sun is visible in the upper right, casting rays. In the distance, there are hints of more complex structures and possibly birds in flight. The overall impression is a stylized representation of a natural environment with some architectural elements.",
