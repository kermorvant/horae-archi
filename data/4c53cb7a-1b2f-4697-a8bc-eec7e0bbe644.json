    "scene_description_enriched": "A bishop, identifiable by his mitre and crozier, stands in the foreground, gesturing with his right hand. He is dressed in a blue dalmatic and a red cope adorned with gold trim. To his left, three cherubic, naked children are depicted within a wooden tub, their hands clasped in prayer. The background suggests an interior space with architectural elements, including a blue wall with decorative motifs and what appears to be a stone structure. The scene likely represents a saintly bishop interceding for or protecting children, possibly alluding to a specific hagiographical narrative or a general theme of spiritual guardianship.",
