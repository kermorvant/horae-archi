    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a knight in full armor, holding a sword aloft, confronting a woman who is kneeling and reaching towards him. A baby is held by the knight. To the left, a robed figure with a staff stands observing, and to the right, another figure, also robed, looks on. The setting is a dark, somewhat abstract landscape with sparse vegetation. The overall composition suggests a dramatic and possibly violent encounter, interpreted as the Judgment of Solomon, where the king's wisdom is tested by two women claiming to be the mother of the same child.",
