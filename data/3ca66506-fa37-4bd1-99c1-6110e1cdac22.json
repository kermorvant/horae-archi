    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts Christ carrying the cross, accompanied by a crowd of soldiers and onlookers. Christ, wearing a blue robe and a halo, struggles under the weight of the cross, which is also being pulled by an older man in a blue tunic. To the left, a group of women, including the Virgin Mary in a blue mantle, observe the procession with sorrow. The background shows a green landscape under a blue sky, with a decorative initial 'E' and Latin text at the top, suggesting this is an illuminated manuscript page.",
