    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a stylized, somewhat abstract representation of animals in a grassy landscape. In the foreground, a brown animal lies on its back, with its head and forelegs visible. Above it, a golden-brown creature, possibly a lion or a griffin, is shown in a dynamic pose, with its paws extended. Behind these animals, a dark brown, dog-like creature with a long snout and pointed ears is depicted. The background is a vibrant green field with a light blue sky above. The overall impression is one of animalistic struggle or play.",
