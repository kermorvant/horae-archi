    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures within an architectural setting. On the right, a robed figure, likely a monk or scholar, is seated and writing on a scroll. They are positioned behind a desk with an open book. To the left, a younger figure, possibly an angel or a disciple, stands and holds a quill, appearing to be in the process of writing or transcribing. The background features decorative elements and what appears to be a vaulted ceiling. The overall impression is one of scholarly or religious activity, possibly the dictation or transcription of sacred texts.",
