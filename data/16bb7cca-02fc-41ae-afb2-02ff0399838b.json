    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family during their flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, cloaked in a vibrant blue mantle adorned with gold trim, tenderly holds the Christ Child. Her head is bowed in a gesture of maternal affection and devotion. To her left, Saint Joseph, with a long grey beard and wearing a red tunic and hood, leads a donkey. The donkey's head is visible, with its ears perked. The background features a rolling green landscape with scattered trees and a bright blue sky, suggesting an outdoor setting for their journey. The figures are rendered with delicate detail and illuminated halos, signifying their divine status.",
