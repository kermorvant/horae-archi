    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a heraldic shield adorned with various symbolic elements. Dominating the center is a large cross, rendered in brown with a textured, wood-like appearance. To the left of the cross, a spearhead points upwards, and to the right, a staff topped with a green orb and a finial is visible. Between the cross and these objects are stylized representations of torches or candelabra, each with three flame-like elements. A small bucket, possibly containing liquid, is placed below the right side of the cross. The shield is framed by a red border decorated with small red dots, and at the top, a green wreath encircles a cluster of black vertical elements. Several orange flowers with red streamers are scattered across the shield, adding decorative accents. The overall composition suggests a symbolic representation rather than a narrative scene.",
