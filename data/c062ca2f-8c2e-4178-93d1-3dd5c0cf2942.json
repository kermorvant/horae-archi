    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a seated figure, likely Christ, holding a globe and a cross, gesturing with his right hand. Before him kneels the Virgin Mary, her hands clasped in prayer. Above and behind them, an angel with golden wings holds a crown. The figures are set against a red, textured background, with the lower portion of the image featuring blue, cloud-like forms. The composition suggests a divine judgment or a moment of intercession.",
