    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts a bust of Christ, framed by ornate architectural elements. Christ is shown with long, dark hair, a beard, and a serene expression. He is wearing a pink robe over a dark garment, fastened with a golden clasp. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing, with the index finger pointing upwards. His left hand rests on a blue orb, representing the world, surmounted by a golden cross. A radiant golden halo surrounds his head, adorned with decorative gold foliage. The scene is framed by golden columns with intricate capitals and a lower architectural frieze featuring arched openings with blue infill, suggesting windows or decorative niches. The overall impression is one of divine authority and cosmic dominion.",
