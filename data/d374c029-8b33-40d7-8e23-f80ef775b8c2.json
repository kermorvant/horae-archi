    "scene_description_enriched": "The image depicts two nude, wild figures, one on the left and one on the right, flanking a shield bearing a complex monogram. The figures are covered in foliage and have animalistic features, such as hairy legs and feet. They are crowned with leaves and hold branches. The background is filled with stylized trees bearing fruit, and abundant floral motifs. The shield itself features a cross above a monogram that appears to be \"MP\" or \"M\" with a cross integrated. The overall impression is one of a decorative border or emblem, possibly related to a specific family or religious order.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene does not depict a specific biblical or liturgical event. The figures are likely allegorical or symbolic, possibly representing wild men or nature spirits, often found in medieval and Renaissance art as decorative elements or symbolic representations of untamed nature. The shield with the monogram and cross suggests a heraldic or devotional context, possibly representing a religious order or a patron. The monogram \"MP\" could stand for \"Maria Mater\" (Mary Mother) or a specific saint's initials, and the cross is a clear Christian symbol.",
