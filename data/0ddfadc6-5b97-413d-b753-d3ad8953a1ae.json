    "scene_description_enriched": "Two deer are depicted resting in a landscape. The deer on the left has large antlers, while the one on the right is smaller. Behind them, a stylized mountain range is visible, rendered in shades of blue and purple. To the left, a tree with sparse foliage stands. The ground is depicted as rocky and uneven. The overall scene is rendered with a limited color palette and a somewhat naive style, suggesting a decorative or symbolic purpose rather than strict realism.",
    "scene_interpretation": "Deer in medieval art often symbolize purity, innocence, and the soul's longing for God, drawing from Psalm 42:1 ('As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God'). Their presence in a landscape setting can evoke a sense of spiritual yearning or a peaceful, contemplative state.",
