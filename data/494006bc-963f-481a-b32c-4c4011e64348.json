    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, possibly a saint or prophet, is depicted holding a banner inscribed with the word 'lana' and decorated with circular motifs. The figure wears a distinctive headdress and a garment adorned with a floral or heraldic emblem. Behind the figure, architectural elements suggest a structured setting, including a column with a capital and an ornate, possibly vaulted, canopy. The scene is framed by text at the top, indicating it is part of a larger illuminated manuscript.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The banner with the inscription 'lana' (wool) and the circular motifs could symbolize a saint associated with wool production or trade, or perhaps a more allegorical representation of purity or humility. The overall context within a Book of Hours suggests a devotional or didactic purpose, likely illustrating a saint's life or a biblical passage.",
