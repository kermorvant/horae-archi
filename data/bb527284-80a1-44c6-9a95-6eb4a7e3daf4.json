    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Annunciation within an interior space, framed by decorative architectural elements. On the left, the Virgin Mary, clad in a blue mantle and veil, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, her gaze downcast. Before her is a table draped with a golden cloth, upon which rests an open book and a vase of lilies. To the right, the Angel Gabriel, in a red robe and green tunic, kneels and gestures towards the Virgin. Above Gabriel, a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, descends with rays of light emanating from it. In the upper right corner, a small roundel depicts God the Father, blessing. The background features a dark, textured wall and a blue drapery. The overall scene is rich with symbolic elements, including the lilies representing Mary's purity and the dove signifying the divine conception.",
