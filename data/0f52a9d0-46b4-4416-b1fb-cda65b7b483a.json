    "scene_description_enriched": "A Dominican friar, identified by his black habit over a white tunic and tonsured head, stands within an architectural setting. He holds open a book with a purple cover, his gaze directed downwards in contemplation. The background features a series of fluted columns supporting arches, suggesting a cloister or a church interior. The floor is tiled in a diamond pattern of red and green. The entire scene is framed by an ornate border with gilded foliate motifs and blue accents.",
