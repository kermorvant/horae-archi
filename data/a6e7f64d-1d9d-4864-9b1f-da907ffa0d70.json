    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin Mary, seated and wearing a blue robe and a yellow headdress, holds the Christ Child on her lap. The Christ Child reaches out towards the kneeling Magus, who is offering a chalice. This Magus is an elderly man with a white beard, wearing a red robe and a fur-trimmed mantle. Behind him, another Magus, dressed in a golden robe and blue hose, holds a censer and a vessel. He is pointing towards a simple wooden stable structure with a thatched roof, under which a crowned figure, presumably the third Magus, is gesturing. In the background, a landscape with rolling hills and a distant settlement is visible under a pale blue sky. The scene is framed by a decorative border.",
