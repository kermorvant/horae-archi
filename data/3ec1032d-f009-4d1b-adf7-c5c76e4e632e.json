    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity within a humble stable. The Virgin Mary, clad in a blue robe, kneels with her hands clasped in prayer, gazing downwards. Behind her, Saint Joseph, with a beard and wearing a purple tunic, pours water from a blue vessel, possibly to wash the newborn. A donkey and a horse are visible behind them. In the foreground, the Christ Child lies in a wooden manger, swaddled in white cloth. Golden rays descend from above, illuminating the scene. The background shows a rough wooden structure with a small, gable-roofed building attached, and a window revealing a distant, idealized cityscape. The overall impression is one of quiet reverence and divine presence in a simple setting.",
