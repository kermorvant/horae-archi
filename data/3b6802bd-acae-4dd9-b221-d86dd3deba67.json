    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an interior architectural space. A bishop, adorned in ornate vestments, kneels before an altar, holding a chalice and a book. He is surrounded by several monks in monastic habits. Above the altar, a depiction of Christ, crowned with thorns and with a halo, stands with his hands clasped. A ladder leans against a structure behind Christ, and various liturgical objects, including candles, a thurible, and what appear to be relics (bones and palm fronds), are visible. The architectural setting features columns with ornate capitals and arches, suggesting a church or chapel interior. The overall scene likely represents a Mass or a devotional service, possibly related to the Passion of Christ or a saint's commemoration.",
