He is carrying a child, also with a halo, on his shoulders. The child holds a sphere. In the background, a monk in a dark habit kneels by a small building, holding a lantern. Beyond them, rolling hills are dotted with trees and crowned with fortified buildings featuring towers and spires. The sky is a vibrant blue with stylized clouds.
