    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a group of figures in a grassy outdoor setting, framed by an arched border with ornate blue and gold foliage. In the center, a figure in a blue robe, identified by a halo, is being apprehended by soldiers in armor. One soldier in red armor is holding a sword near the central figure's neck, while others surround them, some holding spears and weapons. A figure in a pink robe on the left appears to be reaching out towards the central figure. In the background, a person in a pink cap holds up a lantern. The ground is green and textured, with a wooden fence in the foreground. The overall impression is one of capture or arrest.",
