    "scene_description_enriched": "A ram stands in a naturalistic setting with foliage. The ram is depicted in profile, facing right, with curled horns and a fleecy coat indicated by hatching. It is surrounded by stylized leaves and plants. The scene is framed by an architectural element that suggests an arch or a decorative border, with patterned infill above the ram's head. The overall impression is of a pastoral or symbolic representation.",
