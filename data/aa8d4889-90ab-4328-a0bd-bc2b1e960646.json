    "scene_description_enriched": "A figure, depicted with a pale complexion and wearing a white garment that drapes like a skirt, is shown in motion. The figure is raising a tool, possibly a flail or a scythe, above their head with both hands, poised to strike. To the lower left, a bundle of grain, likely wheat or barley, is depicted. The scene is framed within decorative borders and accompanied by the word \"vigile\" in blue script, suggesting a connection to labor or vigilance.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The image likely represents agricultural labor, specifically the threshing of grain, which was a common activity associated with vigilance and hard work. The word \"vigile\" could refer to a vigil, a period of watchful waiting, or simply the act of being vigilant in one's duties. In a devotional context, it might symbolize the diligent spiritual labor required of the faithful.",
