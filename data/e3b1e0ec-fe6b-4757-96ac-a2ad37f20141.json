    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Lamentation of Christ. The Virgin Mary, dressed in a pink robe and white veil, cradles the lifeless body of Christ, whose body is pale and emaciated. To her right, a young man, possibly John the Evangelist, supports Christ's legs and points outwards. To the left of Mary, two women, one in a grey veil and the other in a pale yellow garment, look on with sorrow. In the foreground, a figure in a red robe kneels, head bowed. The figures are set against a blue, patterned background, with a textured, rocky ground beneath them. The entire scene is framed by a decorative border.",
