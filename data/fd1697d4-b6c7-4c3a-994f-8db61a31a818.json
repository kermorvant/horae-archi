    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Trinity. Two elderly male figures, representing God the Father and God the Son, stand side-by-side, both with long white beards and wearing blue robes. They hold a globe between them, upon which a white dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, is perched. Both figures have halos with crosses, and the dove also has a small halo. The background is a vibrant orange with a subtle diamond pattern, framed by decorative borders. The figures' gestures and the presence of the globe and dove clearly indicate a theological representation.",
