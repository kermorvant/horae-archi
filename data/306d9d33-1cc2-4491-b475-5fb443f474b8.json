    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures in what appears to be a wine cellar or storage area. In the foreground, a person dressed in a vibrant blue tunic, adorned with gold patterns, is standing inside a large wooden barrel, crushing grapes with their hands. Red liquid, presumably grape juice or wine, is visible dripping down the sides of the barrel. Behind this figure, another person, wearing a grey tunic and a tall, conical hat, carries a basket on their back, suggesting they are involved in the harvest or transport of grapes. In the background, several large wooden barrels are stacked, indicating a place of storage for wine. The overall setting is dimly lit, with a dark, undefined background suggesting an interior space.",
