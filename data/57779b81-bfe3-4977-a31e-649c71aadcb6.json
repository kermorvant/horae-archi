To the left, the Virgin Mary kneels in sorrow, attended by other women, one of whom holds a vessel. To the right, a group of men, some in armor and one wearing a crown, observe the scene. In the background, a city skyline with towers and domes is visible. The ground beneath the cross is littered with bones and a skull, symbolizing Golgotha, the place of the skull.",
