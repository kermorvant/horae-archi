    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, likely a king or elder, with long wavy hair and a regal robe, gestures with his left hand towards a younger figure. He holds a scepter topped with a cross and a crown. The younger figure, possibly a queen or princess, is depicted with hands clasped in prayer, wearing a similar regal garment and a headdress. Behind them, stylized architectural elements suggest a building with arched openings and pinnacles. The scene appears to be set outdoors, with hints of architectural structures in the background.",
    "scene_interpretation": "The scene likely depicts a royal investiture or a blessing of a queen, possibly related to a biblical or historical narrative involving royalty. The scepter and crown are symbols of authority and lineage, and the praying posture of the younger figure suggests reverence or acceptance of a divine or royal decree.",
