    "scene_description_enriched": "Two bearded men, likely hermits or monks, are depicted in a landscape setting. The figure on the left, dressed in a purple robe and wearing a red cap, sits and reads from a blue book, leaning on a wooden staff. A wild boar stands to his left, looking upwards. The figure on the right, in a dark habit with a golden-brown mantle, stands and looks upwards, holding a book and a staff. In the background, rolling green hills are dotted with trees, and a stylized city with towers and spires is visible under a starry blue sky. The scene is framed by an arched border with decorative elements.",
