    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, depicted in a blue tunic and a red cloak trimmed with gold, stands holding a green book and a staff. He wears a dark cap with a white emblem. In the background, a castle or fortress is visible on a hill, with rolling hills and a pale blue sky. The figure has a halo, suggesting sanctity. The scene is likely a depiction of a saint, possibly Saint Christopher, given the staff which resembles a shepherd's crook or a pilgrim's staff, and the book, often associated with learned saints or evangelists.",
