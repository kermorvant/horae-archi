    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Jesus on the cross in the center. To his left stands the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, with her hands clasped in prayer and her head bowed in sorrow. To his right stands a figure, likely Saint John the Evangelist, also with hands clasped in prayer and looking towards Christ. The background features a stylized landscape with rolling hills and a blue sky. A banner with the inscription \"INRI\" is affixed to the cross above Christ's head. The figures are rendered in a simplified, somewhat flat style typical of some medieval manuscript illuminations.",
