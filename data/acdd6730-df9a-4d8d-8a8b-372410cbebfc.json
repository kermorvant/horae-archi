    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a martyrdom, likely Saint Lawrence, being martyred on a gridiron. Two figures, presumably executioners, are shown prodding the victim with sticks. One executioner, wearing a pink tunic and helmet, actively strikes the victim. The other, in a yellow tunic and blue cap, appears to be recoiling or reacting to the scene. The victim lies on a dark, striped surface, possibly the gridiron, with flames suggested beneath. Above, a golden sun with radiating lines symbolizes divine presence or heavenly reward. The background is a deep blue, dotted with gold flecks, suggesting a celestial or spiritual setting.",
