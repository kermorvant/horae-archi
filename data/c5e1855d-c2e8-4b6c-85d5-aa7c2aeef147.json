    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. Christ, shown with stigmata on his hands and side, is on the left, placing a crown on the head of the kneeling Virgin Mary, who is dressed in blue. To the right, an older bearded man, likely God the Father, also places a crown on her head. They are seated on a golden throne-like structure with architectural detailing, possibly representing a heavenly setting. The background is a golden, textured wall, and the foreground is a golden platform. The entire scene is framed by an illuminated border with floral motifs.",
