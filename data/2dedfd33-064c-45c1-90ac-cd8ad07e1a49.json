    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Holy Family on their journey, likely the Flight into Egypt. The Virgin Mary, wearing a blue mantle and halo, rides a grey donkey, holding the Christ Child who is also haloed. Saint Joseph, identifiable by his halo and staff, walks beside the donkey, carrying a basket and a bundle on his shoulder. They are traveling through a rocky, wooded landscape under a blue sky. The figures are rendered with delicate detail, and the scene is framed by a decorative border.",
