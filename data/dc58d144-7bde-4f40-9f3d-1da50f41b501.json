She wears a blue robe and a pink headdress, with a halo indicating her sanctity. Beside her, two green cushions rest on the bench. To her right, a young person in a green robe stands and holds a scroll. Behind them, a wooden lectern displays a large book, and another lectern holds a scroll. The scene is set within an interior space with a window showing a glimpse of an outdoor landscape with trees. The architecture features blue brick walls and a Gothic-style window with tracery.",
