To the left, the Virgin Mary, veiled in blue, stands with hands clasped in prayer, accompanied by another woman. To the right, a group of soldiers in armor, some holding spears, are present. In the background, a cityscape with buildings is visible against a starry blue sky. The overall scene is set in an outdoor environment, likely Golgotha, with a symbolic representation of the city.",
