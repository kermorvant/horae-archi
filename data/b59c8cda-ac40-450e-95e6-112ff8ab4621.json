    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a royal audience within an interior space. On the left, a woman in a blue gown and a man in a golden tunic kneel before a seated king. The king, adorned in a golden robe and an elaborate crown, gestures towards the kneeling figures. Behind the king, a group of men stand, some with beards and wearing hats. The background features a dark wall with decorative arches and a frieze with inscribed text. The floor is tiled. The scene likely represents a moment of supplication or judgment, possibly from a biblical narrative or a historical event, where individuals are seeking favor or are being presented before a ruler.",
