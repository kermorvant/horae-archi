    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts two figures kneeling on a green ground, with a richly patterned gold and checkered background suggesting an interior space. On the left, a figure in a brown robe with a white undergarment is shown from the back, with hands clasped in prayer. Above and behind this figure, a smaller figure also with hands clasped in prayer is visible within an arched recess. On the right, a figure in a blue and brown robe, with a halo, kneels with hands clasped. A scroll with red lettering emerges from behind the checkered background and curves towards the left figure. A decorative element resembling foliage frames the top of the scene. The overall impression is one of devotion and prayer within a richly decorated, possibly sacred, setting.",
