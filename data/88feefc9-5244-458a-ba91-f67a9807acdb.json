    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a violent act within an arched frame decorated with foliate motifs. In the foreground, a man in red attire and a blue hat wields a sword, seemingly in the act of striking a kneeling figure in a blue dress. Another figure, an elderly man with a long white beard and a red and blue headdress, stands to the right, gesturing with his hand, accompanied by two other figures. In the background, a rocky landscape rises, featuring stylized trees and buildings with spires. Above and to the left, a naked figure is suspended by a rope, with blood dripping from their body, suggesting a martyrdom or torture.",
