She is dressed in a blue robe and has a halo. To her right, the Angel Gabriel, also with a halo and wings, kneels and presents a scroll. Behind them, an ornate architectural structure with columns and arches is visible, suggesting an interior setting. Above, in a celestial realm, a figure representing God the Father is depicted, with rays of light descending towards the scene. The overall composition is framed by decorative floral elements.",
