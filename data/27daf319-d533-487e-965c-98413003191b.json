He wears a reddish-brown tunic and a purple mantle. To his right, an angel, identifiable by its wings and halo, presents another open book to Saint Jerome, pointing to its pages. The scene takes place indoors, with a dark, textured wall behind the figures and a blue, star-studded background to the left, suggesting a celestial or scholarly setting. The floor is tiled.
