The demon, with a grotesque face, pointed ears, and fur-like texture, is shown holding a scroll or book. The man, appearing to be a saint or holy figure, stands with his hands clasped, looking towards the demon. Behind them, architectural elements suggest an interior setting, possibly a church or a hall, with arches and decorative elements visible.",
