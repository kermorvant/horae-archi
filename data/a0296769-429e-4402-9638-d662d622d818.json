    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Crucifixion of Christ, with Christ on the cross in the center. To the left, the Virgin Mary, draped in a blue mantle, is supported by Saint John the Evangelist, who wears a reddish-brown cloak. Another woman, possibly Mary Magdalene, stands behind them. To the right of the cross, a group of figures, including soldiers and onlookers, are gathered. One soldier in armor holds a spear, and another figure in a yellow robe with a blue hat stands prominently. In the background, a city with towers and buildings is visible, set against a blue sky. The ground is green and uneven, with some sparse vegetation.",
