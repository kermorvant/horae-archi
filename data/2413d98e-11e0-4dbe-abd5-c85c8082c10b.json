    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts a religious ceremony within an architectural setting. Christ, with a halo, stands to the left, gesturing with his hands. In the foreground, a bishop, identified by his mitre and ornate robes, kneels with hands clasped in prayer before an altar. The altar holds a chalice and paten, and on a side table are two small vessels and a candlestick. Behind the bishop, several figures are present, including men in helmets and one holding a staff. The background features architectural elements suggesting an interior space, possibly a church or chapel, with arched openings and patterned walls.",
