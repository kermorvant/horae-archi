    "scene_description_enriched": "A ram stands in a lush, leafy setting, possibly a garden or meadow. The ram is depicted in profile, facing right, with its head turned slightly towards the viewer. Its wool is rendered with numerous short, parallel lines, and its horns are curved and prominent. The background is filled with dense foliage and small dots, suggesting a natural environment. The scene is framed by an architectural border with decorative elements at the top corners. Below the ram, a stylized flower or plant is visible. The overall impression is one of natural beauty and perhaps symbolic representation.",
