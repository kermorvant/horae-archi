    "scene_description_enriched": "The scene depicts the Nativity. On the left, the Virgin Mary, dressed in a blue robe, looks down towards a cradle containing the Christ Child. The cradle is rendered in white with radiating lines suggesting divine light. To the right, an older man with a beard, possibly Joseph, kneels and looks towards the child, his hands clasped in prayer or adoration. Behind him, two other figures, one wearing a red cap, are partially visible, observing the scene. The background is abstract and dark, with hints of architectural elements like a red drapery on the left and a suggestion of a structure above. The overall impression is one of quiet reverence and divine presence.",
