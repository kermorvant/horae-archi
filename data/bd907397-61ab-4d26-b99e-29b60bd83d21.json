    "scene_description_enriched": "A bearded man, identified as Saint John the Evangelist by his halo and the context of a Book of Hours, is depicted reading a large open book. He is dressed in a pink undergarment and a flowing blue mantle, richly decorated with gold accents. The background features a patterned tapestry with geometric and floral motifs, and a green checkered floor. To the right, a stone wall with a pointed window is visible, and a wooden lectern holds another closed book adorned with gold clasps. The scene is framed by an arched architectural element with decorative borders, suggesting an interior setting within a religious or scholarly space.",
